                No game no life never cease to amaze me. Even after rewatching, I still found myself to be impressed by this masterpiece of an anime.
The vibrant and saturated color scheme. 
The witty and unstoppable main character duo. 
The concept of Disboard and ten commandments. 
The insane amount of thought and effort put into each game.The hype around Shiro and Sora as they triumphant over their opponents.
The occasional comedic relief of Jibril and Stephanie.
The ability to persist despite being at a heavy disadvantage.
The unpredictability of how the plot development is going to progress.
The occasional ""Wow"" factor that is expected to come, yet comes when you are caught off-guard.
The epic cliffhangers that leave you wanting for more.
The whole idea of playing games as a mean to win whatever it is one desire.
And ultimately, some fanservices here and there to finish off the cherry on top.
There you have it. No Game No Life in a nutshell.
※ Personal Opinions ※
► Many of the games conditions on how Sora and Shiro won can be ridiculous to the point of ""WOW, THAT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE."" This is a double-edged sword, but I believe it is necessary if they want to play against Tet, the god of the universe.
► Fanservice. I agree that there seems to be an extent of it. There are many unnecessary moments where it may kill off the overall vibe of the show. My hope is that season 2 (if it ever comes) tone it down.
► I can't wait for what sort of games awaits for Sora and Shiro and I am extremely excited to see how they will overcome their obstacles through their own ""BLANK"" ways.
Overall, I personally love this show and it's, without a doubt, in my top 5. It is an anime that has inspired and motivated me to create my own related content -- and that to me, is a masterpiece. When an anime creates inspiration an individual.",10,AmaeMei

This anime has proven to be one of the best anime that I have seen in a very long time. I really enjoyed watching it and hope for a second season (but its madhouse so there probably wont be). The only thing I can do is pray to kami-sama and beg for a second season.

                    - this score was based on cuteness that only appeared in the 
                      last episode and will not be included in the final scoring
TIME FOR THE FINAL SCORE BOIS AND GIRLS!!!!
as I have seen anime over the past 6 years, I consider myself somewhat of an anime expert. I can only laugh with joy about this anime and see that this anime is something that can be truly worth ""God Tier"". This rank is something that I have never given an anime before because I have never felt more fulfilled to watch an anime that exceeds my expectations this much. But...some things are left wanted for by the ending. since this is a madhouse anime, this is both a negative and a positive; negative because there is a low chance of a second season, but its a positive because Madhouse has never made a bad anime that I have seen. Overall, a very good watch that I would definitely recommend to others.

INITIAL THOUGHTS
When i first saw the trailer I was so hyped to watch this anime. The art work was like the best of the best. The story seemed really interesting and I was really looking forward to it but the one thing which really annoying was there were only 12 episodes and season 2 was never coming out. 
SUGGESTION
If you are really into anime then you SHOULD go watch this.
STOPILERS AHEAD ( ON YOUR OWN RISK)
CHARACTERS (TOP 5)
Sora - He is the main male protagonist and has a kawaii loli step sister Shiro (loli angel). He was abandoned by his parents and was later adoped by Shiro's parents having gone through a rough childhood, he has a lot of  hate towards life and is pretty much dedicated only to gaming.

Then they got another message telling how unfair the world is and if they wanted to live in a world where game decided everything and they replied positively and they they were transported to a land where everything was decided by games known as Disboard.
  They soon learned that Disboard has 10 rules or 10 pledges which governed the working of the world, they were following :-

The story then continued with Sora and Shiro learning that Imanity is the last race and with the least influence. They both then became the crowned king and queen of Imanity and with the aim to unite all the races and challenge the true king Tet for a match.
ART AND SOUND
No.1 - YOU ARE NOT ON DRUGS.The art and sounds are really amazing, the art of this anime is waht makes it stand out from other anime. It's neonish color is really catchy and its sound is great too. 
ENJOYMENT
It's really entertaining and addictive. The story unfolds with dumb ideas which are then made to be believed really smart. The games and all the scientific references are really great. (especially the Columb force.)
OVERALL
Overall, I really enjoyed this anime.

                I normally consider myself generous when rating shows but this anime pushed my limits.
Story
Sora and Shiro are intelligent siblings who join a game world. They want to take over the world and become Gods. In general it’s a very basic isekai anime that offers nothing special. Half the games they play are not enjoyable to watch since they were boring and did not make sense (such as the chess game they played in the earlier episodes)
Art
I wasn’t a fan of the art. To be honest, the neon colours gave me a headache but the animation was fine.
Sound
The sound was average and nothing special or memorable.
Characters 
The characters are godawful. There is nothing special about Sora and Shiro except for their weird sibling dynamic and their high intelligence. Watching their their relationship was like watching borderline incest, but that’s what’s expected of a crappy anime that follows crappy tropes.
Other side characters were forgettable, but I remember Stephanie or whatever her name was, but her main role I recall is acting like a fan service puppy. 
That’s all there is to this anime in general; extremely excessive fan service that had nothing to offer. The up close shots of Shiros underwear made me feel like I was put on to an FBI watchlist.
The plot was lacklustre and 90% of it was fan service and 10% on boring games that were not impressive. 
Enjoyment: 0/10
I don’t know who would enjoy watching this. The only good thing about this anime was the jojo references. Maybe if you are into lolis and like fan service over an actual plot, it might be your thing but if it is, you need to go outside and touch grass.",1,wowsam

                -Imagine if you an SO that kept talking to you all the time about how you're going to get married and then dumps you after your first kiss. No matter how amazing they might have been, you're kind of bound to hate them.- That's how NGNL made me feel. Not the first anime I've watched that did this, but definitely the best (other examples are Deadman Wonderland and High School of the Dead). What i mean is that this anime, throughout these 12 episodes keeps building up a whole story in a beautiful way. ""Sora and Shiro's mission to defeat god by beating the whole
                  world with their gaming skills"", a story with huge potential that appealed to so many viewers that the anime is the 12th most popular anime on MAL, right after Future Diary (#11). But if you're wondering how two kids from this world can conquer a new one and become gods in 12 episodes, guess what, [spoiler?] they don't... We get an entire first season that builds up a plot worthy of at least 50 episodes, but we stop at 12. Some could say that this entire anime is just a promotion for the light novel and i couldn't agree more. If you decide to watch this, be prepared to never get closure (the ending is a cliffhanger ffs).
Moving onto the regular review part:
Story - Extremely interesting. I presonally found the whole concept amazing and finished the whole anime in one go. Paced really well, doesn't let you get bored for a second, i didn't think of any episodes as fillers or that any plot points were rushed. As i mentioned above, there are many hints and stuff that are supposed to be explored in future seasons but the problem is that those don't exist. Generally, i think everyone can understand what's going on, but there are some points when Sora's explaining is a bit too complex that you may not really get what just happened. On the individual points, the comedy is decent, doesn't really crack you up but i wouldn't call it bad and the ecchi is pretty limited something i would say is to be expected from a PG-rated anime.
Art - Well this is a weird one. The animation was good for the most part, as it is with the other Madhouse productions, but the saturation was really off-the-effin-scale. Yes i agree that vivid colors are really nice, especially when the setting is a game but dammit 12 episodes with a saturation that high has its toll on the viewers eyes and the quality of the work. Since toddlers can't watch this you don't have to try that hard to appeal to the audience with such colors, you're not making toys.
Sound - Didn't really notice since i was either worrying about how the story wouldn't end in 12 episodes or trying to figure out what happened when i was worrying. OP was really good (i have it on loop rn), i never watch the ED when bingeing.
Characters - Sora and Shiro, the type of gamer every gamer aspires to be. Both geniuses, each covering the other's weaknesses. A great pair, but they're siblings so that's that. The characters generally are pretty interesting, as their personalities and relations are influenced by their respective races. Steph is usually the funniest around, since the siblings are too busy displaying their intelligence and game sense.
Enjoyment - I think this is the part where everyone has their own opinion so you're about to read mine. All in all, i really enjoyed this anime. The concept was new to me, the protagonists reminded me of dear Lelouch and the episodes were all fun. Never got bored and kept wanting to watch the next one, despite my gut telling me that the story wouldn't conclude this season around the 3rd episode. Despite that, i tried and managed to enjoy it very much while watching, even though now i'm sad knowing i won't know what happens next for a good year at least, if ever.
TL;DR: Incomplete story, really bright colors, amazing concept, great OP",7,Johnny386

                This s a surprisingly interesting and occasionally very clever anime that has plenty of good jokes. Some of the games in the anime honestly reminded me of intellectual duels between L and Light Yagami in Death Note. 
Details:
Story - while the central idea (of two gamers thrown into a fantasy world where every conflict is solved by playing a game) is fairly simple, parts of the anime that involve puzzles are actually interesting and require thinking. There are also plenty of fairly good comedy scenes. Said comedy can be quite good.
I felt like the quality has dropped a bit in few final episodes, also those
                  episodes for some reason had more references to other anime in them.
Art:
Backgrounds are quite detailed, and art looks good, however, the anime made a fairly strange decision to render outlines on characters with hues red in large number of scenes. I'm not sure why they did that, red outlines can be distracting. Aside from that, art looks fairly good and detailed, although the style itself is fairly simple.
Sound:
Deccent music. Seems to complement the movie quite well, but doesn't stand out on its own.
Characters:
Characters mostly play their roles, and do not really develop over time. Basically, character intractions are often based around gags or the next plot device. Meaning they're interesting to watch, but not necessarily very realistic. Main heroes are some sort of super-intellectual neets, which is not very convincing on its own, and their first companion quickly devolves into a comic relief sidekick. ""Comic reliefs"" are qquite fun to watch., though.
Enjoyment:
It was interesting. ""games"" (basically, matches that settle something by playing some game)  depicted in the anime is quite interesting to watch and are not very predictable. The anime does get slightly worse near the end, but that's about it.
OverallL:
I'd recommend to watch it, if you have the time.",8,GrayRealm

                No Game No Life is definitely something to watch. It may seem like your typical ""the virtual world is better than reality"" type show, but its not. 
STORY: The story starts out with a brother and sister, Sora and Shiro, who are NEETS and ALWAYS win the games they play. They are constantly bored with the life they live and wish for a more exciting life, little do they know that is what they'll get. They are then taken to another world that is solely based around games and gaming.
10/10
ART: The art in this anime is definitely something to talk about. With the vibrant colors,
                  you can't help but feel that you are in a game. The details and the scenery are also something to brag about, its very amazing.
10/10
SOUND: I'm always listening out for the BGM in animes and how the overall OST is. The BGM in No Game No Life is definitely one of my favorites so far this year in anime. The songs always help to set a mood, and also intensify many scenes throughout the anime which, in my opinion, ALWAYS helps an anime. I find myself constantly checking for when this OST is available. 
10/10
CHARACTERS: No Game No Life presents you with your stereotypical characters in anime, but represents them in a different way. Usually side characters have no depth and are only there to help advance the Main Characters in their development/story. But No Game No Life helps to break the boundaries of a typical anime character and adds more to them. You may think you know how a character will be, and then they surprise you with an interesting background to the character which also serves to get you emotionally attached to a character. 
10/10
ENJOYMENT: I never expected to enjoy this anime, cause I'm not that big a fan of Fanservice, but I couldn't help but wait week after week for the next episode. This anime is extremely funny as well as addicting to watch. 
10/10
OVERALL: Overall I will say that if you were having second thoughts on watching this anime, I suggest you put them aside and watch it. It may start out slow but once it starts progressing you can't help but feel that there weren't enough episodes.

                I was so excited to watch this. The colours and the style... what was not to love? I mean the colour palette... I have NEVER seen something like this.
Then again how is this SO perverted? I mean, come on. I felt like a 48 year old perverted man watching this. 
It had a basic story line. Something done so often it should have bored people. I suppose not in this case. Probably because of the colours ;-;
I didn't like the characters. The only character I liked the main protagonist and everybody else just sucked, not including Shiro of course. They were all so daft and
                  it made me question how the ex-princess bet everybody at games.",4,DudexItsFiona
19815,"
                No Game No Life is a standout series, and its reputation as a hit was pretty much guaranteed from the start. A beautifully-animated adaptation of a light novel series full of crazy concepts and fanservice from Madhouse? Who wouldn't be up for that?
But while the series set itself up as a hit, did it make sure it was actually worthy of its reputation while doing so?
STORY (7/10):
No Game No Life has an entertaining concept: two NEET siblings who've never lost a game find themselves in a world where everything is decided on by games. However, parts of the story that are started are disappointingly left
                  unfinished, and considering the series has yet to have a second season announcement, you're going to have to read the light novels to get any sort of conclusion as to what I considered the most fascinating part of the story.
ART (8/10):
This series has a very shiny look to it. Madhouse clearly put a lot of work into making sure this series looked really good and would capture people's attentions just based on the artwork alone. 
SOUND (7/10):
I could take or leave the OP and ED, but if you are watching this series, you must absolutely watch the ED for episode 8. I can't spoil exactly why, but you will understand once you've finished the episode and be impressed by the special effort placed into making something a lot of people would end up skipping.
CHARACTER (6/10):
The area where I have the most issues with No Game No Life has to be the characters. Sora is borderline unlikable, considering how full of himself and full of random knowledge at times that are convenient to the plot he seems to be for a NEET. 
Shiro is a decent character, but I wish there was more focus on her character development throughout, and not just her breasts and panties (especially considering she's 11). The series spent a lot of time with Steph, but never seemed to use her as much other then a butt monkey.
I found myself preferring the minor characters in the series, such as the lovable heterosexual(?) life partners Chlammy and Fiel, charming underling with the most oddly entrancing eyes I've ever seen in anime Jibril, and child god we don't see enough of Tet.
ENJOYMENT (7/10):
My enjoyment of No Game No Life I'd have to say peaked at episode 6, with the series' most creative game and introduction of a great character. That episode alone deserves a 9 or a 10. The rest of the 'games' and events throughout were hit-or-miss for me. Some of the comedy was decent, while other times it fell flat.
OVERALL (7/10):
In conclusion, No Game No Life has its flaws, but will likely be an enjoyable watch to anyone as a whole despite these flaws. It's very good at keeping the viewer entertained and is designed to make you want to watch another episode immediately after you've finished one.

CONTENT ADVISORY: Lots of sexual comedy and moderate ecchi, though no R-rated details ever sneak in. Some occasional moderate profanity. Best for those ages 13 and up.",7,CatSoul
19815,"
                This was on my list of 'anime I will never watch' because of various factors but I decided to watch at least the first episode because it's Madhouse and because the opening animation looks really good. Somehow it ended up being one of my favourite anime. Oh well.
Story 10/10: I didn't even know this was an Isekai before I watched it, therefore I absolutely expected it to be 12 episodes of Shiro and Sora just playing various online games. I couldn't have been more wrong. It was actually my first Isekai anime ever, and I found it interesting from the very beginning, especially the world
                  they get taken into, the society, the politics, the different races, etc. Stuff I didn't think I'd ever care about made me actually binge the show in 2 days. And the games themselves were quick and somehow managed to be intriguing even if the very premise of the show hinges on them never losing a game.
Art 10/10: This is arguably the most colourful show I've come across, which might be a turn-off for some, but to me it seemed like it really contributed to the overall fantastical atmosphere of the show; I found it a pleasure to look at considering all the very popular very dark anime out there. I especially loved the thing they did in episode 9 where Shiro's feelings came across beautifully thanks to the grayscale used. 
Sound 9/10: I loved the opening song before I even watched it, though the overall ost wasn't particularly noticeable apart from one track. The voice acting, however, is absolutely incredible, in my opinion, especially in the main characters' case. I unintentionally heard some of the dub as well, which... is not horrible I guess, but this is definitely a show that should be watched subbed, just for Shiro's voice. :')
Character 9/10: It's fairly plot-focused and yet it still managed to make me care about all the relevant characters in some way or another, though the main driving force behind the show, to me, were the two main characters and their relationship, which might be off-putting for some, but to me it was beautiful and one of the best sibling relationships I've seen in anime. The side characters were fairly interesting as well, though Steph's character could've been used better, but other than that, coincidentally the characters I found most interesting were the ones who got the least screen-time..
Enjoyment 9/10: The first three episodes I kind of spaced out, I felt like I shouldn't binge this show because it's something meant to be savored, but then I watched episode 4 and I couldn't stop watching; it just grabbed me and never let go. I usually have problems with comedy centered around fanservice, but here it didn't bother me as much as it usually would, and I did find it pretty funny at times. I don't think its rewatch value would be very high though, which is why I'm docking off a point.
Overall 9/10: It has its issues, as is the case with any show, but to me it's not anything that would make me change my opinion of it, though the ending did leave me pretty frustrated and praying that I live to see the day we get a second season. However, as much as I love it, I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone who tends to be overly critical or dislikes fanservice-driven comedy or just overall doesn't feel interested in it. If you do happen to be interested in it, though, by all means, it is absolutely worth watching.",9,Foxstens
19815,"
                3 reasons this is a favorite of mine. One is the animation and man do I love how this anime looks. I mean, sure say whatever you want but I just love this style in general. Two, the main characters are hard core gamers and I just personally love gamer type characters. Three, The characters are smart. Not your average smart but actually smart. This is all about how to win a game by outwitting your opponent.
So if you happen to like a character like that or just like to see how they can overcome a challenge in another world, watch this. It's was everything
                  I thought and a some more. It was a anime that I knew I would enjoy from just the picture and a brief summary. If your anything like me, you'll enjoy this anime for sure.",10,MaoOGS

                      The story is simple, 2 shut-ins are sent to another world where all conflict is to be resolved by games. It's simple. The story itself is nothing that spectacular but it's still good.  Story 7/10.
      The art is simply the best part of this anime. It is absolutely breath taking! Art easy 10/10.
       The soundtrack is great! It really fits the tone of the anime. It really amplifies the mood. And note: The opening 'This Game' is one of the best anime openings of all time. Sound
                  8/10.
       The Characters are some of the weakest and strongest parts of this anime. The mains are are great and play off of each other and the rest of the cast as well. But the mains do lack some form of... originality...? Sora is a 18 year virgin with sexual needs, I think that this part is handled well and often made me laugh. But I think Shiro is where it really starts to fall apart. It's blatantly stated that she's a genius, but it almost feels like Sora is the smarter one. It says Shiro is the genius but Sora always is making the moves and seems to be overall more intelligent than Shiro. And pretty much all the other characters are really 2 dimensional. Stephanie= dumb, idiot, but of every joke in the first 3 episodes. Jibril = fan service bot. Plus this anime feels the need to add 50 characters an episode. So sometimes it just feels crammed. Still, every character is still charming? WITCHCRAFT! Character 6/10.
       The enjoyment! I ENJOYED THIS SO MUCH! With all it's flaws it still was fun to watch. And part of that might have been the fan service and pop culture references, but I really enjoyed this. Plus the thrill of finding out how they won the game is so satisfying, I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff. Enjoyment 10/10
        The overall rating is very good, would recommend. The thrill of the game is so satisfying. Overall 8/10.",8,Patter-Klatter

                Definitely a lot of mixed feelings for this one. After watching a few episodes, I thought this could get interesting with intriguing games having a similar vibe to Death Note and Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor. However, I was mistaken.

[contains spoilers]
Story:
Let's just say that the entire anime felt slightly rushed given that there were 12 episodes. However, I do acknowledge the fact that probably because of the insane art, they had a limited budget. Basically, Mad House (studio) intentionally tried to fit everything. The evidence is that the OPs and EDs were cut out in various places. 
Now let's get to the meat of things. The biggest letdown of this anime was that the main characters: Shiro and Sora were winning the games out of their a** but of course, not all the time.  I understand that the race: Imanity has no special powers compared to the Werebeast and the elves and have to use their wits to win. But there were so many instances where what Sora and Shiro does to beat the game is plausible. How did Shiro know where to put this? How did Sora know the other characters felt this way? I am not sure if the studio cut a lot of stuff from the manga or not but more explanation would have been nice. I might just say that they have some ridiculous plot armor! Of course, I am not saying the games were no good. In fact, they were interesting to keep me watching.
The comedy was alright but I felt some repetitiveness after some time. One of the biggest surprises was the amount of fanservice it has. I mean most of the characters are female so it's like a harem anime for Sora. The fanservice is greatly integrated with the comedy. Also, I should point out that there was such a huge emphasis on how much Sora and Shiro loved each other to the point where it overshadows the game. It's really a nuisance when they keep mentioning this, especially in the flashbacks. I'd rather have more explanation on the game itself.
The reason I state this is because the flow of the plot heavily depends on the games. The interesting games are what stands out from other animes. The plot is pretty much predictable. Sora and Shiro are unstoppable and is going to dominate the world. This is somewhat anticlimactic so the games itself are a key component that keeps the viewers to watch. With such a key component executed not so well, the fanservice is what keeps the viewers to watch.
I assume there's going to be a 2nd season judging by the ending but if there isn't, that would be a huge letdown. Hopefully, there will be more for the conclusion.
Character:
Basically, having two ridiculous smart geniuses make other characters look like idiots. If you think about it, all they're doing is deceiving and dominating others, the world and eventually the god Tet. Sounds like antagonists right? Despite their sportsmanship behavior to be friends, that doesn't help me to sympathize with the main protagonists. On the contrary, I sympathize Dola and her grandfather more because the characters feel more realistic. Other characters were just meh, just average characters. Some of them do not flow properly with bipolar behavior so it's probably more for comedic value. Also, it's possible that there will be more character development if there are more seasons but for now, it's just that.
Art/Animation:
The art is absolutely superb to say the least. There is none quite like it. Sometimes, some glares would make it difficult to see but quite remarkable. This style of art makes the viewers feel like they are in a game and it also gives the impression that the main protagonists feel alive in the game rather than in real life. Not surprising for NEETs ;)
Sound:
The most noticeable ones are probably the techno OST that makes it sound like you are inside a game. Quite a refresher from other animes. I would not mind listening to them in the future. The ending is also interesting.
Enjoyment:
Other than a few nuisances here and there, this was definitely fun to watch.

Interesting but leaves the viewers with a lot of questions. You can say that this anime is somewhat 'rushed' if you will. 
In conclusion, if you are looking for some interesting entertainment with a lot of funny and outrageous fanservice, then I definitely will recommend this.",7,Uniden

                No Game No Life is an ingenious burst of color and adventure.
NGNL has its own unique artistic expression. The look is so refreshing that it's easy to get lost and feel the fantasy of the virtual world. The storyline is amazing! Using 10 rules this brother and sister duo is able to think outside the box and conquer their quest to beat the ultimate game. NGNL really shines when the odds are stacked against them and you find yourself wondering how they will weasel there way out of every mess. The characters are pretty well done. This anime makes the popular mistake of overly sexualizing
                  a very young girl. It is also refreshing to see such a confident MC. The different races are unique and interesting and they manage to sprinkle fanservice without sacrificing content. All in all, NGNL lives up to its rating. You must watch this.",9,GodBlessDXD

What do you think of your life? Do you think it's fun? Do you think the World you live in is fair? If I give you a single opportunity to change all that, so that you are finally valued and recognized as you deserve, would you accept it? Interesting...so, let’s play?
No Game No Life is an Anime produced in 2014 by Madhouse Studios, original work by Yuu Kamiya, or Thiago Furukawa Lucas, in it we especially accompany Sora and Shiro, two siblings who spend their days locked in their room and gaming all day and, thanks to all the time dedicated to this activity, they're
                  unbeatable in any game that exists, causing fear and admiration in the hearts of all gamers, where they're known simply as ""blank""
Sora and Shiro also received the same proposal made at the beginning of the video and, after winning a simple game of chess, they’re transported to a new world, called Disboard, which was created by Tet, the God of the Game, and everything from simple discussions to even conflicts between nations, must be resolved through games, whichever they are, and follow the 10 pledges, which are the only rules that keep the control of this world
Right off the bat Sora and Shiro are introduced to this new madness, because upon arriving in the kingdom of Elkia they discover that the King not only died, but he also declared that his successor wouldn't be anyone in his family, like his granddaughter Stephanie Dola for example, and announced a major card tournament among the three million inhabitants, and the winner would be declared the new king, or queen, of the Imanity, and it's obvious that, since we're talking about games, isn't difficult to imagine who won this tournament....No, no, it was Sora and Shiro
Now, declared king and queen and representatives of Imanity, they're in charge of saving this kingdom that's on the verge of destruction and, through the most unusual games, face all the 15 races that exist in this world, ranging from Elves to even Gods...everything said so far seems very promising and interesting, doesn't it?
Not only the rise of Sora and Shiro, but the Anime itself is very light and relaxed, however, if we look behind its vivid and extravagant coloring, the humor of the world and its characters and even its Ecchi theme, No Game No Life is an extremely philosophical Anime, and forces us to question not only about the society in which we live, but what's truly important in our lives, especially the strength in being weak.
That's one of the main messages in No Game No Life, there isn't a single way to live your life, everyone can and must follow their own path and explore their limitations and qualities and, if you're being called as ""weak"", let the ""strong"" speak whatever they want, you, more than anyone, know what your true value is, after all ""A weak person can be a King at the right place""
So now, what I want to know of you is, will you continue following the same path as everyone else and giving up of your potential, or will you get up and make your own path, following the ""blank"" that only Kings have the courage to walk?
Bellow there is a video link, entitled “Weakness in No Game No Life”, which better analyzes the Anime and its premise as a whole, making this review even more accurate (Please turn on the English Sub for it).

O que você acha da sua vida? Você acha que ela é divertida? Você acha que o mundo em que vive é justo? Se eu te der uma única oportunidade de mudar tudo isso, para que enfim seja valorizado e de fato tomar o seu devido lugar ao sol, você aceitaria? Interessante...então, vamos jogar?
No Game No Life é um Anime produzido em 2014 pelos estúdios Madhouse, obra original de Yuu Kamiya, ou Thiago Furukawa Lucas, onde nós acompanhamos em especial Sora e Shiro, dois irmãos que passam os dias trancados dentro do quarto jogando o dia inteiro e, graças à todo tempo dedicado a essa atividade, eles são imbatíveis em qualquer jogo que existe, causando medo e admiração no coração de todos os gamers, onde são conhecidos simplesmente por “blank”, ou vazio
Sora e Shiro também receberam a mesma proposta feita no começo do vídeo e, após vencer um simples jogo de xadrez, são transportados para um novo mundo, chamado Disboard, que foi criado por Tet, o Deus do Jogo, onde tudo, desde simples discussões até conflitos entre nações, devem ser resolvidos através de jogos, independentemente de quais sejam, e que sigam as 10 pledges, que são as únicas regras que mantém o controle desse mundo
Logo de cara Sora e Shiro são apresentados a essa nova loucura, pois ao chegarem no reino de Elkia descobrem que o Rei não só chegou a falecer, mas o mesmo declarou que o seu sucessor não seria ninguém da sua família, como a própria neta Stephanie Dola por exemplo, porém anunciou um grande torneio de cartas entre os três milhões de habitantes, onde o vencedor seria declarado o novo rei, ou rainha, dos Imanity, e é claro que, já que estamos tratando de jogos, não é difícil de se imaginar quem venceu este torneio...
Agora, declarados rei e rainha e representantes dos Imanity, estão encarregados de salvarem esse reino que está à beira da destruição e, através dos mais diferentes jogos, enfrentar todas as 15 raças que existem nesse mundo, variando de elfos até mesmo deuses...tudo falado até agora parece muito promissor e interessante, não é mesmo?
Não só a ascensão de Sora e Shiro, mas a obra em si passa ser bem leve e descontraída, porém, se olharmos por trás de sua coloração viva e extravagante, o humor do mundo e de seus personagens e até mesmo a sua temática Ecchi, No Game No Life é uma obra extremamente filosófica, que nos obriga a questionar não só sobre a sociedade em que vivemos, mas o que é de fato importante em nossas vidas, em especial, a força em ser fraco.
Essa é uma das principais mensagens em No Game No Life, não há uma única maneira de viver a vida, cada um pode e deve seguir o seu próprio caminho e explorar as suas limitações e qualidades e, se você está sendo tachado como “fraco”, deixa os “fortes” falarem o que quiserem, você, mais do que ninguém, sabe qual é o seu verdadeiro valor, afinal “Uma pessoa fraca por ser Rei no lugar certo”
Então, o que quero saber de você é o seguinte, vai continuar seguindo o mesmo caminho de todo mundo e abrir mão do seu potencial, ou vai levantar e trilhar a sua própria caminhada, seguindo no vazio que só os Reis têm coragem de trilhar?

                No entiendo como a la gente le puede gustar semejante bazofia mediocre que es tiene mas fanservice que el relleno de naruto.
lleno de clichés personajes totalmente genéricos y bizarros trama tosca y sin sentido pero mas que toda mediocre.
solo en el capitulo 1 que es donde se supone debería atrapar al espectador con algo relacionado a las estrategias etc.(genero de esta asquerosa serie)
Todo lo contrario; Hacen trampa, usan magia, personajes tontos, y ni hablar del jodido fanservice que esta cada 5 segundos, etc.
Es peor que ver hajimete no gal como serie romántica!!!!!
como puntos positivos estarían la banda sonora de fondo y el diseño de personajes
                  aunque tampoco son la gran cosa al menos están decentes.

                For months now I have heard nothing but exceptional praise for a certain anime that released earlier this year. Every anime forum and website has been buzzing with conversations about the series and a few of my friends have been wondering why the hell I haven’t gotten my ass on the bandwagon and taken a ride on the No Game No Life hype-train. Well, much like Attack on Titan or Sword Art Online, I waited a while. Let the waters simmer down so I can enjoy the series without the added benefit of eighteen thousand people telling me it’s the greatest thing to happen to
                  anime since panty shots. Thing is, the hype train hasn’t settled and I don’t feel that it will until long after season two is released. So join me as we take a seat on the train and enjoy the passing countryside, arriving at our penultimate destination, an arbitrary score.
No Game No Life opens with a brother and sister duo composed of an eleven year old named Shiro and eighteen year old Sora (they go by the team name Blank). These two are the greatest gamers in the history of forever, defeating even players who cheat. When they get a mysterious email asking if they feel that they are not in the right world, they respond yes and after a game of chess, are transported to another world, a world where everything is decided by games. It’s not long before Shiro and Sora are playing games to take over countries, with the eventual hope of defeating God.
It’s a pretty cool plot that, sadly, is underused past the halfway mark. The series opens with a lot of fast paced games, each episode moving along at a good pace. But about halfway through it gets into a bit of a slump before the really grand finale. That slump doesn’t detract much from the series as it allows the comedy and characters to shine through, but I’m not a big fan of slowing down after blasting off so fast from the starting line.
The games themselves are usually games we have in our world, but with an occasional twist. On top of these games are the bets made between each player, which can alter a person’s state of mind or make them completely disappear. That makes for some exciting and intense games…you’d think. The problem comes from the fact our main characters, from the outset, have Kirito Syndrome. They are overpowered and can’t lose.  They’re the best gamers anywhere and they refuse to lose. Each game they play ends with some sort of tactical advantage or are even won before they begin due to quick thinking on our hero’s parts. That certainly leads to some impressive solutions to problems but also can make any sort of drama to be had during the games null and void. When character’s don’t screw up or don’t show fear of losing, you become less emotionally invested in what is happening and it’s just a flat story being played out on your screen. And sadly, that’s what the drama boils down to.
And it’s not that Shiro and Sora are bad characters or anything, because they’re actually fun company. A duo of NEETS who can’t deal with life away from each other, can’t deal with crowds, and Sora in particular is a giant pervert. The series doesn’t do the drama well but, with the help of other characters, Sora and Shiro bring the humor that makes this series stand out to me. It’s very fast humor, tons of references and character quirks that make for fun watching. I think I stuck around the series just for the characters and their silly interactions rather than for the games.
If anything, the secondary characters are more memorable than the main characters (who are pretty memorable in their own right). Stephanie Dola is the granddaughter of the last king and a persistent, silly girl. I liked her at first but she quickly became the “sex-her-up” character. And some of those scenes were funny, but she didn’t seem to be there as much to help progress the plot or build character as to be sexually abused constantly for humor’s sake. Jibril was another character I really liked. She’s got no emotions and has these weird, sexual flashbacks to murdering people during a war. She was another silly character but damn was she entertaining. None of the other characters are really worth mentioning as they were all pretty flat. They provided some good humor throughout, but weren’t worth remembering.
So what is this series? Another genre question that pops up in my mind. It feels a lot like Sword Art Online to me as far as crossing genres goes. It’s a shonen, it’s a comedy, and it’s also (kind of subtly but not really) a harem anime. It’s got all your favorite character tropes too! “Sister whose not really my sister so fucking her’s okay”, “Big boobs whose easy to abuse”, “Subservient girl”, “Tsundere who totally doesn’t like you baka”, and “Loli animal ear girl”.
Aside from all that, I enjoyed the plot and characters. I enjoyed the comedy and the games. What I didn’t enjoy was the animation. The animation for this series gets a lot of praise for some reason, but I’m not on that wagon. I can appreciate the sheer number of colors being used but the soft focus combined with the over-saturation of colors is enough to give a person a headache. It’s a unique but, for me, less appealing style.
Offsetting that is the glorious music, which I enjoyed thoroughly.
Listen, No Game No Life‘s good.  It’s entertaining as hell and that’s about all you can ask for. But it’s another case of the hype making my expectations really high. And that’s not detracting from the score I give it because I feel what I’m giving it is very fair. But I am a little disappointed. After hearing so many good things about this show I was expecting it to blow me away. It didn’t, but it did keep me engaged and wanting more, which is more than I can say for about eighty-five percent of recent anime. So I can see where the high scores come from. But for me, it’s still tarnished by the lack of drama, the genericism of certain characters, and the animation. Is it the best anime I’ve ever seen? Hell no. Is it the best anime of the last few years? No. Is it the best anime of this year?   It’s the best I’ve seen so far that’s been completed (but will most likely get knocked down a few pegs by year’s end). Is it a good anime? Yes.
I’d definitely suggest it. But be prepared to wait patiently for the inevitable second season.",8,ratchet573

                I'll keep it short, no spoilers.
No Game No Life isn't bad, it just isn't that good.
I had fun to watch and i definetely recommend you to watch if you're looking for something very light. The story is really simple, and that's okay, the characters are a bit exaggerated and there is way too much fanservice.
I mean, lots of references to videogames and anime are really nice and fun, but the excessive fanservice in every character (Expecially EVERY female character of course) is ridicolous . This becomes even more ridiculous with Jibril.n Ok, she's hot, but really? An entity like that portrayed as a hot lady
                  like that? That is basically the function of Steph.
So, in conclusion,
No Game no Life is a fun anime to watch, with some scenes that are really nice and memorable, some nice ideas but lots of cliches and waterfalls of fanservice. It suffers from some pacing issues and lots of banality in the writing but it's not to be considered ""BAD"". 
Watch it without too high expectations and actually you'll find something fun to watch.",6,WiseWackyWizard

                I love this anime. The characters are amazing and you get to see them develop. I love how they resolve everything through a game. The plot is great. just wondering if they will have a season two. If you are looking for anime that is fun with a good plot I recommend it.
 These are the ten pledges that the characters have to follow in the games.
All murder, war, and robbery are forbidden in this world.
All conflict in this world will be resolved through games.
In games, each player will bet something that they agree is of equal value.
As long as it doesn't violate pledge three,
                  anything may be bet, and any game may be played.
The challenged party has the right to decide the rules of the game.
Any bets made in accordance with the pledges must be upheld.
Conflicts between groups will be conducted by designated representatives with absolute authority.
Being caught cheating during a game is grounds for an instant loss.
In the name of God, the previous rules may never be changed.
Let's all have fun and play together!",10,Abdihassan

                Certainly an interesting watch. I decided to watch this series after becoming vaguely familiar with it's premise. Two MMO playing Shut-ins are thrusted  into a video game world. Pretty standard Isekai-stuff. Keep in mind, this series is somewhat of a absurd-comedy, so don't expect anything overly griping. I enjoyed the art-style more then anything-else, this series is gorgeous. But the plot is somewhat mediocre, the characters are kind unlikable. Sora, the Teen-age protagonist is  kind-of flat at-times, his plans feel self-centered, and his  whole ""Perv"" igets kinda boring. His Step-sister, Shiro is certainly more interesting. Certain episodes hint at a tragic-backside. This
                  is an Ecchi show, so there's plenty of Fan-service, which is not really my thing, Some of it was kinda Cringe-worthy at points. Overall though, dispute all the negatives I'd still recommend  this series If you like Isekai and ecchi stuff   and a less serious plot, go for it.",5,RandoplhRocker
19815,"
                The first time I tried to watch this was years ago, I was fairly new to Anime at the time and I couldn't get through the first episode because lets be real, the fan service is ridiculous, and at the time the most fanservice I had experienced in anime was the Sexy Jutsu.
However I am glad I gave it a second chance, I watched it again recently and It was much easier to watch this time now, probably because I've become desensitised to fan service. I am not going to write any spoilers but I thoroughly enjoyed the story, It developed in a really interesting
                  way and I found the characters all to be likeable and relatable in their own ways.
I would not suggest watching this if fan service grosses you out! But if you're okay with it please give it a watch, the story is unique and I wish they made a second season because I was excited to see it progress! I think I might hunt down the manga and see if I can read through the rest.",10,tiapizzeria

                I enjoyed some aspects of No Game No Life thoroughly, and spent a lot of time rolling my eyes at some other components. It has a fun, appealing premise with great potential, its got a really solid score (fantastic intro) and humour, some of which I enjoyed,but much of it is unnecessarily lewd and lives in the mind of a adolescent boy. Our protagonists are infallible Mary Sues, which is not in and of itself a dealbreaker, it can be fun to have invincible main characters, but that means the journey to the win is what is key. It's too often apparent there are 
                  very implausible leaps of reasoning in the main characters' guesswork, and, there are far more internally consistent ways to attain a win that aren't pulling a rabbit out of a hat. It also lacks a true ending. 
Ultimately, this is a popcorn show. It's pretty, there's a few laughs, and plenty of space for a young male viewer to place themselves in the position of the protagonist (Sword Art Online is that you?) who happens to be the only male character in the show with anything more than 30 seconds of development. It's not very subtle. It's solid for what it is, but I saw far too many flaws to consider it as anything greater.",6,Galladrim

                No game No life is a good looking show, with a good looking art style that's suprisingly unused in animation. However, I dropped it on the first episode the moment it started sexualizing the MC's 11-year-old sister. Still don't understand why this shit is acceptable for mainstream anime. It shouldn't be this hard, just don't show the 11 year old's panties. A pretty simple rule, yet NGNL can't even wait 22 minutes without breaking it. Why Madhouse. Why did you feel the need to sexualize the child? Why is the 11 year old is attracted to her brother and horny? Why is there  apparently
                  another loli later on in the show that joins the MC's Harem? Why a lot of things Madhouse.",1,matthewm13

                Make no mistake this show is quite good. It's not a masterpiece as some people claim but it is also not complete dog shit. The main reason I gave it an 8 rather than a 9 is that the show never (currently) received a second season which severely hinders the shows ending as it ends on a cliff hanger that was clearly meant to be picked up within the 2nd season. Other than that hindrance I find the show really enjoyable the characters are all entertaining in their own way, especially Sora as there is not a single scene involving his character I don't find
                  funny or endearing. But mostly funny moments.",8,LunySword

                this is my first review and i will try my best to write decent one . don't be harsh on me , cuz English is not my main language . 
"" no game no life "" is your another isekai anime with 2 overpowered main characters , but this time instead of them being powerful by brute strength , they are extremely smart .  
i will try to give my opinion on the show 
warning : if u hate any kind of fanservice anime or hate every anime that has ecchi elements even if they have good story and characters , then i don't
                  recommend this anime , cuz it has a lot of "" unnecessary ecchi moments"" 
ps: even tho i like ecchi and fanservice in general i still think it was unnecessary in this anime . cuz for most of the people who hate this show only reason they can think of is ecchi and fanservice moments . but i mean cmon ecchi and fanservice doesn't make show that bad even tho i agree that it wasn't good for this show to have one . 
 story and setting: 
it  has  best fantasy setting   as far as isekai goes . it has a large world with many races going against each other , but instead of fighting they play games  , cuz it is world of games . everything is decided by games . players for example 2 players when they have conflict or smh else they set the rules of the game and say  what will award be for the winner . the one who gets challenged chooses the game they play . our  2 main characters ""sora"" and  his little sister "" shiro "" are  living together in japan . they are living alone spending time playing games everyday and living as people say shit lifestyle . they are very good at games and they are famous duo in gaming world and their nickname is "" blank "" . also their last names are not mentioned in the show . their  goal is to beat god in a chess game . so they are trying to unite other races cuz they have chess pieces and there are 16 races . exaclty  for a chess game .
art: 
madhouse did great job doing this ( as always ). artstyle is very good. world is colorful cuz it's world of games and funny things so it perfectly maches theme of the anime 
sound: it has many good themes. it has one of my favorite osts "" one of me is one of you "" which is really hype theme ( even league of legends took this for one of their animated videos ) . it has my 2nd favorite opening theme   ""this game ""  and really heartwarming ending "" oracion "" . 
characters :
it has great characters . designs are very good. everyone is pretty enjoyable 
sora and shiro are my fav duo in all of anime
enjoyment :
one of most enjoyable shows for me. it is really fun and engaging to see 2 main characters interact with other people. they are not very used to people and are locked in themselves "" anti-social "" . so everything they have is each other . really smart and  convenient big bro and high iq  little sister .

                Lets get one thing straight right off the bat, this is not a deep or mature series, it's full of fanservice, stupidly OP characters and plenty of otaku pandering. It's trash, but it knows it! Rather than your average run of the mill pretentious light novel bullshit, this one knows what it is and it rolls with it.
Lets start off with the art and sound. 
The adaptation was done by the king of animation studios MadHouse, so it's automatically going to be pretty good. The animation itself was pretty basic as well as the character designs, but MadHouse decided rather than outlining the characters with
                  the standard black, they outlined them with a soft red, giving the art an almost surreal feel to it. The art style fits perfectly with the incredibly detailed and beautiful backdrops that make the whole world feel alive. The sound track was also pretty good. It was fast paced, exciting, and fits well with the overall atmosphere of the anime.
Then we have the story.
And there's not much I can say aside that it's totally basic, typical and is overall nothing to talk about. It's definitely not the worst, but remember, this is a light novel, we can't have an actually deep and compelling story! There is absolutely nothing original about it. 2 prodigy misunderstood children get transported to a far off magical realm filled with adventure and excitement! The world itself was pretty interesting, a world where everything is decided by games, but it's more of an excuse for the characters to be stupidly OP. The story is basically about the characters taking over the world, kind of like the recent anime Overlord, but less boring and more centered on, you know, actually being overlords. There is, however, good feeling of progression and escalation that makes it very entertaining, as well as strategy and interesting ways the characters face challenges. Though even with all of the over-the-top strategy, it is still very simplistic, and not great as a whole. The story kinda sucks, but its pretty clear the author didn't think it was that important to the overall book.
Next lets talk about the characters. 
This was one of the series' strong points. While the character development isn't incredible, each character has their own sort of charm. You have Sora, who would be a pretty standard main character, but Sora stand out from the rest by having an actual personality! Quite the rarity for light novels. Sora is a very charismatic and well founded character who makes you want to root for him. You also have Shiro, Steph and Jibril, all of them are fairly typical archetypes but each character has their own quirks to make them all feel unique. All of the characters were pretty well founded but unfortunately they are not all fully fleshed out due too the series being cut short. Overall the characters were basic but fun and made the anime much more enjoyable.
Now onto value and enjoyment.
As for historic value or value as a story there is none, it's just another light novel adaptation. I will say it's the best one I've ever seen, it's still totally trash, but it avoids being pretentious by being self aware and not taking itself so god damn seriously. Don't get me wrong, anime should be taken seriously, I don't think anything can be truly good without being serious and having solid story and good characters, other than that it's just mindless entertainment. But, If a series is trash it's nice for it to acknowledge it's place in the garbage. NGNL is everything a schlock light novel adaptation can be, yet it will never be as popular as most because it didn't get a full adaptation. As for enjoyment, I absolutely love it. It has plenty incredible action sequences, stratagy, mind games, and yes, PLENTY of fanservice. What can I say? I love self aware series.
No Game No Life is the best light novel bullshit anime I've ever seen. I can understand why it has garnered so much hate, and I would probably hate it too if it wasn't so honest with itself. The series will probably not get a second season, because anime nowadays are just advertising the source material, so that's disappointing. It's still worth watching, hate it or love it it's an interesting watching experience.
So whats the verdict?
Congratulations! No Game No Life is the only light novel adaptation that makes me want to read the source material! In the end I give it a 7/10, very entertaining and worth watching If not just to kill a few brain cells.",7,Gay_Frog

                After only 4 episodes in I'm so glad I started this!
This is incredible so far, the story and reasoning behind the characters is awesome. The speech Sora gives on why he is going to save the race once he becomes King is so on point, and the way he wins the Chess match through his force of will is amazing.
The explanations of why he does what he does to win at games is also awesome, and the whole concept is fascinating.  Going to update this once I finish it!
So far the only thing thats throwing me off a little is how intense the colors
                  are, but I get why they made that choice and it's growing on me

                  land where the very idea of humanity is reduced to child's play, Sora and Shiro have finally found a real reason to play games: to unite the sixteen races of Disboard, defeat Tet, and become the rulers of Disboard. 
The story of no game no life is pretty simple and easy to follow. The idea of being board with with and wanting to escape was pretty relatable as most people dream of escaping their daily lives. The progress of the story throughout the season was well executed and didn't feel rushed and allowed it to develop. The comedy aspect of the show were absolutely incredible and really enhanced the story, the action sequences were phenomenal
The biggest strength of this anime are its main characters Sora and Shiro. Both were well developed throughout the show, and had great chemistry with each other. The way they played off each other was perfect. For me Sora was the better of the two because I feel that he got the most development, and was the most relatable, he was extremely funny and smart and watching him on screen was like watching A.J Styles wrestle meaning that he was great. Shiro was also fantastic and just as funny as Sora, and her backstory is well explained. Moving on the the two main side characters Jibril and Stephanie, both have their shining moments. Stephanie has more backstory and development than Jibril however, Jibril was the more better of the two in my opinion. 
Madhouse studio did a great job with the animation of No Game No Life. It is unique and some of the best art I’ve seen in anime. The world of Disboard has beautiful due to the fantastic location design; the character design is also well done. The opening song id brilliant and perfectly matches the tone and story of the show. The ending song is more subtle and light and is also fantastic.  
Overall, I really enjoyed No Game No Life. The characters and story were relatable and fun. The world of disboard is intriguing, and the music and design were great. Episodes one, three, four, six and twelve standout as the best episodes because of their absolute craziness and brilliance. The chess game, the word chain and the shooter were all phenomenal. The action sequences in those episodes were of cinematic quality. The comedy was fantastic, and didn’t overshadow the story.
The issues I have with No Game No Life is the fan service. I generally have no problem with fan service, but there are certain points where a line has to be drawn. For use using an eleven year old girl for fan service defiantly crosses that line. Also there are sixteen races in the world and we are only introduced to six of them which was a bit of a let down,
That aside I'm really hoping that there is a second season to no Game No Life, because they have only scratched the surface of what the show has to offer.",8,saeid_2k

                This show has a similar set up to the typical light novel in that there's a gary stu main character transported to another world, gathering a harem of girls and showing off his OP skills to solve the problems going on in this world. Although, it sets apart from other series of this kind when regarding what that OP skill is and that's apparently that this gary stu, Sora, is supposedly a genius gamer in a world where games decide everything.
No Game No Life really tries to be smart and flaunt it in the many games the show features and I admit, it's at least
                  fairly creative, no where near the most creative I've seen but still creative nonetheless. However, the creative ideas it has are not well put together to make satisfying mind games as the majority of the tactics the main character uses relies on his opponents being absurdly stupid in the most convenient way for him to win. Then there are the few games that don't fall under this problem, which are either really simple joke games or vague skimmed over games they never explore.
You can really feel the author's obnoxious arrogance oozing from the show. It's like if someone loads up a fighting game like Street Fighter on VS mode and plays against an empty second controller, beating the playerless opponent, record it and brag about how they won. It's really obnoxious and that's reflected in the characters of the show as well such as the arrogant gary stu MC and the cast of weak stupid girls who he picks on. The author only cares about showing off the most over the top tricks of the MC and nothing on how the rest of the game fits or even the opponent's perspective of what a rational person would do in their position.
It also makes it hilarious when you consider how the author got caught tracing as if he thought he could get away with cheating just like his gary stu MC. No, you're not Sora, who can magically make the rest of the world stupid just so he can look smart. It's actually pretty ironic how residents of a world where everything revolves around games can be so bad at games. But the author probably didn't consider that as neither did Sora he was never shown to research on their skills, he just plays and was conveniently better than them all.
Although a merit I can give is that at least it's not always Sora hogging the spotlight. He also has a cute sister who sometimes gets her shot at being the one to come up with the genius plan. Although her coolness is partly negated when she also failed so Sora could take over and be the one to show off again. The other characters are just the other aforementioned stupid girls who Sora beats and collects a harem like Pokemon. There's not much depth other than Sora complaining about how stupid people are.
I heard the series gets praise for the pretty colors although I think the red outlines just look messy. When it comes to the character designs, they're charming as usual for the anime aesthetic but still nothing special. There are a few good songs though and the show occasionally has funny references to other anime.
I know I mostly complained on this show until now but still, I at least appreciate that this show ""tries"" which sets it above the standard light novel that just copy and paste the same story with hardly anything else that's special. It's true there are many ideas poorly put together, but it's better than no ideas and it's true the main character has an obnoxious arrogant personality but that's at least better than no personality. There are of course much better light novels out there that not only try to have creative ideas but also use them well along with having interesting characters and drama. 
No Game No Life overall is a dumb entertaining mess. It's not very good but at least it's better than boring even if just the bare minumum.",4,psyko-freac

                Despite the scoring, I'll be honest and quick about this one. I'm in love with the trope of the main character(s) being transported into another world, who doesn't?
Unfortunately almost all of these types of anime are filled with perverted shut-ins who only seem to have the rest of the world tied to the back of their hand.
No Game No Life can safely be considered a step down from that cycle. The main characters consist of two siblings who are generally OP in all types of games, in hindsight you may think that this anime falls into the same category states above; but there's a slight
                  catch.
Whilst the male protagonist may have the same perverted thoughts expected, they are hardly acted upon on as much as you'd expect. Unlike other characters' he gives an excuse (a poor but understandable excuse), secondly he is constantly ties to his younger sister who consider themselves a perfect team which is made clear throughout the story. Whilst the characters are insanely powerful together they admit they have their weaknesses and strengths, but overcome this together. I admit this idea is unrealistic but still enjoyable as, unlike other anime's, we see weaknesses in the protagonist(s), weaknesses that make them human and relatable. Well almost relatable.
Overall, it's predictable. Overused. Barely unique.
....But it's enjoyable, addictive and a pleasing to watch.
It isn't for everyone, I agree, it has it's flaws. But if you're tired of seeing the same old trope in anime's that you believe has potential, then perhaps this could raise the bar for you, a closer step to meet your expectations. Give it a chance and maybe you'll come to appreciate the subtle differences that make this anime unique amongst it's dreadful peers.",5,hannah545

                The series follows Sora and his younger stepsister Shiro, two hikikomori who make up the identity of Blank, they are an undefeated group of gamers. One day, they are challenged by the god of games to chess and are victorious. As a result, the god summons them to Disboard, a reality that revolves around games. Intent on maintaining their reputation as the undefeated gamers, Sora and Shiro plan to conquer the sixteen ruling species and to usurp the god of games.
In story aspect no game no life has great structure and unique storyline, along with the blank journey we learn more about sora and shiro
                  relationship, and appearnly they are badass team that has high intellectual with chill attitude oh and stephanie their, yea Stephanie is not a strong character but she did a job well done
In art aspect not gonna lie you need get used to it first because how saturation been handle, but after you get used to it probably about 10 minutes I say it look beautiful and really unique it also great metaphor for how sora and shiro also first seeing the ""game world"" cause how different it is, kudo to madhouse to once against blown us away.
In character there a lot of likeable cast like a lesbian elf, thirsty succubus, doting grandfather, a god that powerful yet child-like 
Now let's talk about the fanservice, it's really annoying and unnecessary you can talk whatever you like about ""bathing together for ties our relationship traditional Japanese"" sora but get bath together with a loli and make your own sister naked is really disturbing and don't say ""she not related by blood"" Sora, the fanservice is what hold this anime to 10/10 categories.
Overall is great anime with a good mechanic battle that relied on intelligence of that person and a good twist to make the games more interesting, character that really great especially the blank they're really badass and see them full a plan is really intriguing overall a great anime and I give solid 9/10.",9,4ndhika

                Anime with a large focus on gaming is steadily becoming a lot more popular. Be it cute moeblobs creating their own video games or ordinary humans finding themselves in a fantasy RPG, there's certainly anime out there that gamers are sure to enjoy.
No Game No Life is a rather curious specimen of its kind.
The intriguing thing about it is that it focuses on traditional games - board games, card games, even Rock Paper Scissors. The fantastical world it takes place in isn't even a video game. This world, called Disboard, runs on a system where everything - from minor disagreements to international conflict - is
                  resolved via games, where each participant wager for a prize and penalty for the winners and losers. Sounds neat, right? Not when the human race are majorly disadvantaged compared to the other 15 races. So our heroes of the story - the super-talented stepsiblings Sora and Shiro - help humanity to show the other races how powerful it really is.
That, right there, is an incredibly interesting premise... right? But there is one thing that utterly ruins it.
Note that I described these siblings as ""super-talented"". By that, I mean ""they have never lost a single game and they never will"".
That... is actually a major problem, at least with the way this is handled. I mean, in shonen anime we always get super-strong and super-talented heroes, but more often than not they start out unremarkable but grow stronger with each passing episode. Because of that, they undergo a lot of challenges and perhaps even lose a few battles. But Sora and Shiro are already the most powerful characters from the get-go, and the series makes no attempts to hide it. The first warning sign is in the first episode, where they defeat the God of Disboard - who, mind you, is supposed to be the best gamer of all - in a game of chess. And even though they play games against weaker characters throughout the series in order to fulfill their goals, these games only get more ridiculous from there. They do not run on logic, they do not make the viewers sit on the edge of their seats in anticipation. They are merely there to advance the plot and to showcase how intelligent the siblings are.
Oh and by the way, this heavy focus on the siblings only makes the other characters look stupid in comparison. The fact that they act stupid as well, particularly after they each lose their respective games with the siblings, only makes matters worse. The worst offender here is Stephanie Dola, the granddaughter of the previous King of humanity, although I can't really blame her. On top of never actually doing anything badass on her own - with one exception, but even then it was part of the siblings' plan - she only exists to be objectified and humilliated by the siblings in almost every second of her screentime. In most of the time she spends on-screen, she is barely wearing anything, and she's not even very happy about it at all. I see this as a major sign of sexism in anime, and seeing it in No Game No Life hugely disappoints me.
Speaking of fanservice, oh, there's tons of it here. Pretty much every female character will be naked save for cloud censors around her at some point in the show - yes, even the eleven-year-old Shiro. I'd just brush that off as the Japanese invoking a sense of innocence on her, but since there are MULTIPLE INSTANCES of nudity and panty shots from her, I doubt it. Lots of fanservice is one thing, and if the female characters are interesting enough I wouldn't mind it. Lots of fanservice applied to some of the most unlikable female characters I have ever met, including a loli, is a whole 'nother story.
All in all, don't be fooled by the tempting premise and beautiful art. By watching No Game No Life, all you'll be getting out of it is stupidity, fanservice and boring action scenes.",6,Psychedelicate

                I've been looking forward to watching this for a little while now, so I do have a little hope and good expectations going into it.
Sora and Shiro are adorable together, it's nice to see close siblings. Not weird close, just usual loving close... mostly.
It's very bright and colourful, I think that's supposed to enhance the feeling that they're inside a game, which isn't really needed, but it's nice. It makes the art style different, which is usually always appealing. The colours are actually charming to me.
They are both really intelligent people and use it in little sly ways to benefit themselves. Plus for the whole
                  point of the story, to win the games. 
They make a friend in Stephanie, so she gets their help as well, sometimes to be nice, sometimes if it gives them an advantage.
The world has 10 pledges or rules, and they cannot be broken or you'll be punished. But that doesn't mean you can't work around them or twist them to your success, if you're clever.
Having conquered their own world in gaming, they're excited to find something new to challenge them.. To bring the 16 races together and to become Kings. Even maybe Gods?
The Ecchi is good, it's not forced or out of place so it fits. Stephanie and Shiro are a good choice of character for it too, then with Jibril joining too. Adding someone other than Sora's sister takes the weirdness away. 
Shiro's character type is pretty common, but I really like her. Her personality and look are a great match and I love it.
It is funny, it kept me entertained from the first episode and I really enjoyed it. The characters are cute and funny, the story is different so it's interesting, the art style is different but nice. 
It takes some turns that you definitely wouldn't expect. 
If cute girls, games, complex thought patterns and genius characters are your thing, this is definitely worth watching.",9,Mikame-

                No Game No Life (or NGNL) is a good Anime.
Gaming is a part of the world that means everything is choosen by games. 
If you lose -you have to do what the winner told u before.
There are 10 rules:
1. All murder, war, and robbery is forbidden in this world.
2. All conflict in this world will be resolved through games.
3. In games, each player will bet something that they agree is of equal value.
4. As long as it doesn't violate pledge three, anything may be bet, and any game may be played. 
5. The challenged party has the right to decide the rules of the game.
6.
                  Any bets made in accordance with the pledges must be upheld. 
7. Conflicts between groups will be conducted by designated representatives with absolute authority. 
8. Being caught cheating during a game is grounds for an instant loss. 
9. In the name of god, the previous rules may never be changed. 
10. Let's all have fun and play together!

                If I could give a comparison to another series its Code Geass.  The difference between them can only be explained in weight and scale while Code Geass uses a game of chess as an under current of it's main focus, the games are the main focus of NGNL.
The plot has a common basis with a lot of other shows, main characters fall into another world and the story expands from that point, except here the end goal of the series is given extremely early on.  With that as set up most of the show focuses on the games each one is really just
                  fun to watch.  I can't describe the show in any other words except for ""fun.""  The colors are bright colorful and pop out.  
The story is extremely simple but it really doesn't need to be.  The show has a simple goal and it does its job well of making the viewer want to play along in the world the characters enter.  
The music does not really have any outstanding tracks but the several reference tracks to other video games were just fun to listen to.  Speaking of references, the show rewards the otaku and videogame fanbases with several several references both visually and verbally.
The main characters do not really have development as they were already established with their goals, skills, and dynamics in the beginning of the show.  They didn't change but they didn't need to since their arcs are going to be spread until the final conclusion, and the side characters all have their one to two episode arcs that develop them to probably where they will stay if the show comes for a second season.  The problem is that it turns into harem anime at some points and really I know its for comedy purposes but it's really distracting.
Overall this show is something an anime fan would watch if they want some good old escapist fantasy.  The world and situations the characters go through are fun to view with the weight of kingdoms on the back burner while the characters play the game at hand.  If you want something to watch this season check the anime out but the ending will leave you wanting more and if this show gets green lit for more seasons it would be an excellent anime to marathon through.",7,auraflash

                Story:The story is pretty much like any other Isekai and At that point it just feels repetitive. It takes place with Sora and Shiro who are step siblings and They do nothing, but Play games all day as their alias is known as BLANK within these games. After defeating this one opponent in said game, they are then brought into a world that is literally built on the law of games and challenges. There is a 10 commandments when it comes to gaming and All that trivial crap. It turns out they are brought into a world to save the race of humans in a
                  competition against War-beast, Death Angels, Animorphs ( Animals/Humans ) and etc etc. MY only problem is the HUGE ass cliff hanger in the ending and That's been six years and The only thing we've gotten was a True beginning from The movie No Game No Life:Zero. Which I find it hard to believe cause the studio that made this anime is known as MadHouse and They are honestly one of the better studios. When will we get a true ending for No Game No Life? Who knows???  
Art: The art style is something very much different compared to other anime titles, is it good? Yes. Most viewers have actually said that the anime is extremely good and That is one of the main points within this anime that is liked by many, so I would say the anime done my MadHouse is better than most. 
Sound: The Intro for No Game No Life is done by Konomi Suzuki and I do love the intro with is Rock n Roll progression and It's many keyboard transitions. While the ending is great. It a Rock n Roll score that gives you a visualization of Sora and Shiro and Why they are happiest when they are close to each other. It's not even like a creepy brother/sister complex either, but More like a want of understanding and comfort. I honestly did enjoy both the Intro/Outro on a personal level. 
Character Development: Character development would probably be the weak point for this anime or Genre as a whole. I never really liked the idea with Isekai protagonist being OP and Having to never really accomplish their goals, unless through some plot armor or Usage of cheat codes. This anime is no different as Sora and Shiro are pretty much unbeatable. Especially as team BLANK. Aside from the one time or two where they do lose, the character development just isn't there.
Personal Enjoyment: Majority of time I noticed No Game No Life was mainly just another Isekai with the same values as any other Isekai. Throw in some Comedy, Some fan service, Another digital world and What do you have? Another generic copycat of a Isekai. Honestly I'm glad the genre is dying out, as this has been going on since the release of SAO and That was around 2012-2014? I forgot, but Isekai needs to go away and Give the spotlight to someone else. Thank god for 2020 it's the year of the Light Novels and Manga, as in lots of Light Novels and Manga are going to have their very own anime adaptations and I am super happy about that. 
Overall: Overall when I heard people hype up No Game No Life I thought this was gonna be a perfect anime, but As you can see it isn't. Again another anime that been overrated by the general populace and It's low IQ hypebeast. I don't see the reasoning for this being a perfect anime, unless you lack the actual knowledge and Input to see what a perfect anime is, then I guess I can't blame you.

                -- Story --
     Sora and Shiro are set to dominate the world through their intelligence and skills in various different games. The best part about the different challenges is that it takes the traditional game and flips it on it's head. It adds an entirely new dimension to what we all thought we knew about a certain genre of game or a specific game. the other positive would come through the wide variety of games presented. Board, word, and card games are all there. The weak point of all this is that sora and shiro tend to have a ""make it
                  up as we go along"" mentality. This tends to  leave the story to rely on random encounters and leaves the viewer with a vague sense of their motivations. They just come off as a ""go with the flow"" attitude that doesn't necessarily fit into a world domination plot. 
-- Art/Sound --
      Bright, vibrant colors dominate the entire world and characters. It really emphasizes the ""game world"" and gives it a lighter tone overall. However, the world as has a dark contrast to emphasize when a more serious/dire tone is taken. The balance between the two is very strategic and implemented well. 
      The sound for each instance further emphasizes the light and the dark. the best examples of this can be found in Sora and Shiro's challenges with different races/nations. Each encounter kept me interested in the story, but the music only increased my interest and kept me glued to the screen. 
-- characters --
     The main focus lies on Sora and Shiro. In them lies the strength of the series. They naturally mesh and feed off of one another, but unfortunately that seems to be the only natural element to any of the characters. Stephanie plays the goofy sidekick that gets the brunt of misfortune. Jibril basically just takes whatever order Sora gives and provides fan service. Even Sora and Shiro suffer from a lack of depth. They are the seemingly invincible duo that seem to not have any flaws when it comes to their gaming skills. What one lacks, the other has perfected. It creates for situations that are falsely tense and lead to end results that don't nearly feel as satisfying. Other characters that appear in the show usually are only pawns in the grand scheme of things for Sora and Shiro or are their to show the diversity of the world. It is sad to see such interesting races like the warbeasts and the angels take a back seat in the end.
-- overall -- 
     I enjoyed my time watching No Game No Life thoroughly. The world grew on me in the diversity of the world and through the life it showed. The challenges through the various games kept me glued to my screen but i always came out a bit flatter than i would have hoped due to the ""invincibility"" factor. The series holds a lot of promise going forward and i will definitely be watching, but it needs to create more depth in the characters to make the transition from good to great.",8,gnomefactor

                Pros:
- Its nice to see an anime that uses a lot of neon colors that really pop.  Most of the ones I see use the usual ""real world"" colors like greens and blues and whatnot.
- I enjoyed watching the sibling bond in this.  It was, for the most part, (with some exceptions) not creepy and weird.
- I'm a sucker for anime that has a lot of problem solving and deduction skills (see also my reviews of ""Hyouka"" and ""Death Note"".)  This one was no exception.  If anything, I enjoyed it a bit more here since it felt like there was more
                  at stake with each problem Sora and Shiro faced.
- I like the world that is created here.  It seems like a relatively fun place to live, if you're smart enough.
Cons:
- Fan service is obnoxious here. Stephanie really served no purpose whatsoever except for this and a couple minor plot points
- Frequent usage of lens flares detracted quite a bit from what could have been astounding animation.
- Hatsuse Izuna is a super annoying character
- Pretty much everyone other side character was boring as well
Overall:
I both understand and don't understand the hype this gets.  I keep hearing SAO is pretty bad, so maybe I'll think this is better if I see that.  For now, its an average series with some pretty visuals, and some interesting problem solving.  If you don't mind excessive fan-service and boring characters as much as I do, you'll probably get into this.  This is probably one of the better series in the ""virtual gaming world"" genre that's been coming out a lot lately, but I don't think that says much.  Not a horrible series; it has its moments that pique my interest and catch me off guard in a good way, but somehow I can't entirely sink my teeth into it like other people seem to do.",7,OahuOtaku

                I’m going to give my honest opinion on this. I absolutely loved this anime due to many factors. I myself haven’t read the manga or the light novels but I will say is that Madhouse did a great job with No Game No Life and they lived up to my expectation of them with this. Now here’s why I thought this was a splendid piece of art.
I’m not very good at analysing detail but the major reason to why I loved this anime is that uniqueness No Game No Life has compared to other anime. Madhouse does a good mix of both an intriguing and
                  wonderful story and comedy at the right times in addition to the well done character development. To me I also thought that the art style is very unique with an interesting choice of colours. Just to reassure that this is only my view and yours may differ from mine about this series.

                This is another high fanservice anime. The writers even joke about how much fanservice there is from time to time. That's a major downside for me anyways though.
The story is great, very interesting, very fun, very short lived. This is the kind of anime that is barely worth watching, not because its bad, but because its over before the story ended. I'm guessing there's a manga, and if you like reading manga, go read that! it'll be much better than being left off like 1/10th the way through the story.
I recommend this anime to anyone who's fine with stories ending before they are finished, or
                  who will go finish the story by reading the manga assuming there is one.",6,Sevikodkod

                No Game No Life is what you get when you mix a handful of creative writers with masterful animators. It's one heck of a project, and it works.
The animation is done by Madhouse, so it's no surprise that the series looks absolutely stunning. Colors are vibrant and pop out. The characters feel fresh and alive, which is quite the compliment since certain shows have a hard time with character designs working naturally. The world is so well drawn out that I felt a unique type of immersion while following the characters on their journey.
Music here is top notch. The soundtrack for both action scenes and
                  more dramatic moments work well together and compliment one another. At first, I wasn't too impressed by the OP. I'm a big fan of Konomi Suzuki, yet, the song didn't really do much for me. With that said, the more I listened to it, the more I appreciated the song. I still don't think it's great, but I have more of a liking to it now than I did before. On the other hand, the ED is amazing! It might be my favorite ED of all time, which is saying something. I barely ever love most ED's in anime, but this one was perfect. 
Our two main characters, Sora and Shiro, happen to also be brother and sister. Sora is someone that is quite determined when it comes to getting what he wants. He's forceful, but thinks things through beforehand to make sure that any decision he makes is correct. Shiro is much more quiet than her brother. The anime doesn't necessarily say it out loud, but she seems to think thing through much more carefully than her brother. Perhaps that's just how I viewed her. I never once thought Shiro's brother was more intelligent, despite their age difference. Both are enjoyable to watch and create funny gags with their characters. Sora usually is in charge of the fanservice jokes, while Shiro is more about commenting, or adding, onto the humor being performed.
There's not much else to say about No Game No Life. It's one of the most entertaining pieces of art in the last few years. It's funny, dramatic, and creative with every episode. It's a shame that the series is only 12 episodes long. Hopefully there will be another season!",9,usaking

The neon colors mixed with the dull world, when we first met Sora and Shiro they were living in their dull grey boring tokyo life, they transported into a different world after beating a GOD at chess. See I loved everything about this anime, the fanservice.. all of it. The characters are well drawn and their plot is good, in future episodes they bring back parts of them living in Tokyo and their fear of that outer world. i'm hoping for a season 2, which will hopefully be a likely thing to happen since NGNL has gotten pretty big. I am so
                  thankful for my friend telling me to watch this, i throughly enjoyed it. 
now one thing that i have to say that I disliked about this show was the amount of repeats, it seemed that every time Sora had to fight someone he always seemed to repeat everything he had said before. 
With an anime like NGNL with knowing that Sora and Shiro want to challenge God to a game they have to win every game they play with the other races. That pretty much ensures that he's going to win every fight because how else would he get there? Of course theres the little bumps in the road which they seem to over come but it's just going to get boring watching them play a game every episode for a piece of god. thats literally why theres so much fanservice to fill in the gaps.
but besides all that it was overall a great anime and it's time to watch the movie !!!",10,epipens

                WOO, the red outlines, vibrant colors, very eyegasmic. The music, don't get me started.
No Game No Life. 
Life itself is an endless game of preoccupation. If you aren't playing anything, then you sort of have ""no life"" as to say. 
If you're somewhat of a gamer, this echos a pretty strong atmosphere of an escape from reality into a ""reality"" with endless possibilities and potentially boundless adventure, action and mystery. 
I think we can all relate to the main characters. Spawned from nothing, dragged into a world that is fixated on ""growing up"" and tossing away enjoyment that serves no greater purpose. Hit with sort
                  of a debt. The debt of keeping and sustaining life. Being something we don't have to be, doing things we don't need to do, caring about things we don't care about.
Story(7/10)
 No Game No Life depicts society as a bunch of people in business suits that for the most part fixated on the maintenance of their image on how they appeal to society. We follow 2 NEET siblings as they are taken away from reality into a mysterious world filled with the logistics that everything is settled by a game. 
This makes life there feel more vibrant and exciting. Who doesn't like games? Competition is rather quite fun. 
But the story is sort of generic, lots of harem, lots of eech, basic alt. reality plot but this by far is one of the best in it's genre of fantasy and escape2gamereality. Everything is a gamble, there is a risk, people cheat, it's one hell of a challenge. 
Art(10/10)
pretty vibrant colors. diggin the red outline. 
Sound(10/10)
Do not get me started on the opening. The beginning piano sequence was very sad, yet very real. OST is lit.
Character(8/10)
The girls in this anime are pretty generic although I haven't met any character like Shiro before. Harem, tsundere tropes everywhere
Enjoyment(10/10)
Very much enjoyed. There is an intrinsic challenge in that humans are the weakest race in terms of physical strength and almost everything else. It makes it all the more interesting on how they are going to punch through their tropes and limitations. The chess analogy was spot on.
Overall(7/10)

                if we are talking about fan service seriously I am not the fan of Brother-Sister love stories or any other weird things between them.
what you see in this anime is totally foolish. 
they had a great base story that is about games and peace and the world without war but adding weird things that we call them fan services ( i mean a relationship between two main characters and a half naked dumb girl that follows them ) is something that makes this anime so nasty.
it makes me uncomfortable to communicate with the anime.
I don't know about other fans but I am not watching anime
                  to see how can a brother and a sister can have a weird relationship.

Decent base story
Cons :
Sick mind Fan Service
Boring Art
Weak Characterization

                No Game No Life (NGNL) is the ultimatish example of satirical intelligence. Much like what you see in Benedict Cumberbatches interpretation of Sherlock Holmes' character, you can expect a lot of what the eager audience considers ""intelligently cool"" to be chopped down into a blend of indomitable narcissism and a complete disregard for any feasible scenario by the writer. The one major difference between NGNL and that Sherlock prick is that NGNL is leagues more playful, and it benefits from that to no end (despite losing out on practically everything else). I consider this show to be a rather poor example of how to use
                  'super-intelligence' as a power, but it really is a show that you just love to love, peaked not only by its beautiful art and (somewhat) entertaining cast of characters but also it's phenomenal sound-track; which really puts that oomph into every episodes climax.
So then, let's begin at the start. The story. Which has two major distinctions, and two major flaws. The first distinction in the story is that our MC's come from another world. Yes, I know, a very cookie cutter beginning, but I don't really have a quarrel with it so long as the story does well to remember it, which it does buuuut not in a way I like. The only reason that we're reminded of our characters origin is, at the end of the day, to depress us. Every time origins are brought up its followed by a complete loss of colour pallet, soft and moody music, and some sad story about how much our MC's hated the world we live in. Its almost they're trying to reach through the screen and say ""Yeah... you're life is reaaaaalllly shit, look at this total work of fiction, wish you could enjoy this? Tough shit we're not making season 2"" - This is, of course, regardless of the fact that they just spent 15 minutes pumping us up and building up the hype.
Anywho, the second major point of the story is that our characters are ""super-duper smart"". One is a sweet-talker and the other is apparently a quantum-computer disguised as a human child. While they each have their specialty they're both equally as impressive in their peer's respective fields and the only reason we pretend that one is better at something than the other is that it fits their rather uncanny personalities. But that's not the point. ""super-intelligence"" is SO much harder to execute well in a show than - I reckon - even the writer expected. In certain cases, it feels like the solution was thought up before the conditions of the problem and it leaves a lot of the climaxes feeling hollow. This isn't even to mention the fact that this super-intelligence is only ever exhibited when the MC's overcome the issue and reveal that ""yeah, we thought you'd do that like... 3 episodes ago"". There's no genuine quick-thinking in this show, which is something I can heavily praise a show like Death Note for (a show that does super-intelligence more correctly). And, to add to that, after watching a show like DN you do really miss out on that ""catch up"" moment, where everything clicks into place and you feel like you've finally caught up to something being worked on for episodes. I think the best way to put it would be 3-dimensional. NGNL's interpretation of super-intelligence, however, is extremely 2-dimensional.
Besides, maybe, a few cultural complaints, like sexualizing a 12-year-old, a ridiculous amount of poorly executed sexual tension and the annoyingly incessant and, sometimes, incestuous referencing of sex, I can't really think of much else to complain about. Although it is fucking weird. I understand that in Japan a lot of this stuff is considered humor and the rest is probably a bi-product of their relatively controversial laws and culture that centers around being allowed to sexualize children (at least in cartoons). I can only say that I find it cringy, and from a western perspective, it really damages the overall viewing experience. If you can find the humor in it, more power too you I guess. If you find anything else from it... see a therapist.
I'll close this off with what I Believe warrants such a positive score, despite my rather heavy bias towards negative feedback. The artwork is amazing. This is what a proper fantasy setting looks like and its only sweetened by the most vibrant color-pallet I've ever seen. The music elevates every moment to make it feel like its so much more than it really is. It has such a great effect on some scenes that it could almost be considered overbearing. The characters are entertaining. Outside of the annoying humor and cringy attachment to animals and genitals, the characters are actually fun to follow. They don't develop in any way but they're in a position (especially given the length of the series) where I wouldn't really want them to - this is the kind of show where the world adapts to them, not the other way around. Finally, the experience. Its awesome. It leaves a little to be desired in a lot of places but I don't think NGNL takes itself seriously enough as a whole to actually consider that a deal-breaker. If you can see past the cringe behavior and rather shameful comedy then I do wholeheartedly recommend that you give this a try.",7,LackOfARealLife

                The story has oh so much potential. I could see the idea spanning hundreds of episodes. But lets hope it doesn't. We want this story is short, important bursts to keep the momentum flowing and I think it does that. Truly the palette is a bit white-washed but that's not that bad right?
Enter the powerful and calculating Sora (brother), the quite and unassuming Shiro (sister) and the ditsy but heart-of-gold Stephanie (slave?). Yes the series are liberal with females of every trope and they will sometimes show off more than what's appropriate for day time television but you can convince yourself its primarily all about
                  outsmarting and outplaying opponents right?
Fan service aside, the anime is obviously riding on the tails of other said video game animes but this isn't a bad thing. In fact, it offers a fresh new perspective on a genre we already thought we were comfortable with and the playful style will have you rooting for our brother/sister from start to finish, even if we have to suspend our disbelief by just a little.",8,Tarkemelion

                WHY I LIKED:
⬤ Oversaturated/pastel colors and smooth animation (though it gave me migraines at some point..)
⬤ Creative designs (The entire planet is a spherical chess board!)
⬤ I enjoyed Jibril and İzuna boss fights. Both settings were well designed.
⬤ Constant tension through 12 episodes. The story never slows down, on the contrary, it also preserves its lightheartedness.
⬤ Intense scenes are always backed up with some fast energetic electronic/pop music which makes the whole season very easy to dip in one sitting.
⬤ The soundtrack is very vivid and above average, in harmony with the art style, though nothing particular stands out.
⬤ I found Shiro very unique and
                  likable. Voice, Expressions, the way she insults others. She is %100 kawai
WHY I DISLIKED:
⬤ Too much fanservice, harem
⬤ Too much yelling
⬤ The concept of conquering lands and millions with gambling and other crappy games, Im having hard time accepting it..
⬤ The way puzzles and conflicts were solved isnt rewarding. I guess this is what happens when a self-insert main tries to solve puzzles..

The anime did fine job in most areas. However I am highly allergic to ecchi and comedy combination, even so, I tried my best remaining objective as possible by giving it a juicy [[8/10]] !!

Because of the many positive comments and his hyps, I finally decided to give him a chance. However, this turned out to be a fatal mistake.
Genre: The genres were poorly implemented and are emphasized too weakly. In addition, the ""humor"" in the anime is not even there if it is intended for pedophiles with sister complexes.
Story: The story is pretty simple. A sibling couple, another world comes to him and tries to regulate the whole anime with everything through games and to conquer everything until they can finally challenge God. Everyone has implemented it even more boring than it is and until
                  episode 9 nothing interesting happened.
Animation / pictures: Definitely one of the few anime that I can criticize superficially due to its incredibly bad drawing style. In addition, the general animations are pretty bad and the brightness of the anime is far too high, it really catches the eye.
Characters: Well. The characters couldn't have been worse. Little kitten sister and a completely perverse big brother. Their relationship also suggests a sister complex of the manga.
Conclusion!
Definitely one of the worst anime that I've come across. The hype and its positive evaluation are not worthy of him. It is also a simple pedophilic ecchi that shows an extreme little sisters fetish and even offers a lot of skin from 11 year old children. No humor, no story, just boring.

                This show seems to get a fair amount of flak, that I personally find a bit unjustified. Yes, the fanservice is admittedly gratuitous and very prevalent, and yes, the characters and story aren't exactly deep, but that's not really what the show strives to be. When it comes to many shows like this, you usually always know that the main character/s will come out of whatever battle or confrontation they're in as the victor, however they will struggle a bit in order to add elements of tension. This show's main protagonists, in a show like this, are going to win regardless, so why hide it?
                  That's essentially the way the show is laid out. What makes this show worth watching is seeing how these characters and their stupidly high intellect will go about winning these games. If you're looking for something deep, you won't find it here. If you do, however, look at this show for just pure entertainment value, you may end up having a good time with it. This show revels in it's ridiculous, over the top nature, mixed with a batch of interesting games with varying crazy and amusing rulesets that provide much spectacle, with a particularly beautiful artsyle to boot.
If you want to get the most out of a show like this, I'd take it for what it is. Entertainment; which it delivers in spades.",9,Aluhvee

                No Game No Life was the third anime in its concept I had watched (after Overlord and Sword Art Online), where a teenage gamer finds himself locked in a virtual dimension (details aside).
The sole reason I haven't given it a perfect score is the fact that there may not be a following season/anime, and that saddens me. Also, Sora and Shiro are too ""overpowered"" for their age (mostly Shiro). [-1 pt]
Nonetheless, I loved this show, it's incredibly well-made, very humoristic, and it's very touching to see how the relationship between Sora and Shiro evolves in this new world. The characters have some depth to them
                  and the visuals are incredible. I find the artists did a splendid job, compared to some other animes, being consistent with their color palette and the different tones used in varied situations to present the viewer with different emotions.
*Special mention* : No Game No Life has one of the best opening theme songs of all animes I've ever watched (and I've watched a couple). I never get tired of hearing it.

                Having only seen two episodes, the characters intrigued me in the first episode, and I lost all interest in the second. I came into this anime knowing it would be filled with fanservice, and if my 9 score on Kill La Kill is any indication, I have no problem with fanservice. My problem comes when it becomes shameless. You write two very interesting characters dependent on each other only to turn the brother into a hopeless virgin that longs to get his dick wet. I get that the joke is that he can't get with his sister because incest, and she's like 12, but it
                  just wasn't funny to me. It came off as loli incest pandering, rather than any sort of comedy. The story's concept isn't bad, and the art and sound are definitely above par, but the characters just killed it for me. The princess came off as overbearing with her repeated ""I'm bound by the Covenants to love this guy but I don't want to"" joke. It was actually pretty funny the first time, but it had already gotten old by the second time and was basically unbearable for me. There's only so much you can do with a single joke, at it wore out the second time she began slamming her head against the wall in frustration.  I love the opening song. It gave me hope for the show when I first heard it. I don't know, I just hated the characters.
EDIT: Oh, and feel free to take this with a grain of salt since I only just barely made it through two episodes. A lot of people follow the ""three episode rule,"" but I find no value in that. Most anime that I hated on the first or second episode never turned out to be any good after three, but that's just me.",4,BrokenKnives

                this is going to be my honest review. people were saying this anime was great because of it's bright colors that caught peoples attention and the story. so, i thought why not give this anime a try. this is my opinion keep that in mind and don't come for me if you don't like i say. 
story:
first, the story... the story is honestly so confusing. i understood it at first but towards the middle it got very confusing and it's all over the place. i had no clue what was going from episode 3 and onward but i still forced myself to finish the entire
                  series. i have no other comment but to say that the story isn't organized for me to follow up with it. 
art:
now that we got the story out of the way, let's talk about the art style. let me be honest here, the art style is AMAZING ngl like the colors were bright which i loved and it was so pretty. the color choices were definitely my kind of liking and tbh it was the reason why i didn't drop the anime. so the art style was definitely to my liking. 
sound:
now for the osts.... it was okay. i loved the opening A LOT and i still do but the other osts were decent. i'd definitely listen to the opening from time to time but the other osts were eh. 
character:
now let's talk about the characters.... i- literally hated the relationship between shiro and and sora. i felt SO UNCOMFORTABLE because these two siblings were TOO close and they made weird comments too like? just- no i hated it and i was so uncomfortable. that's it. and also why did they have to give all the females big boobs LMAO. LIKE?! ok whatever fan service but like stephanie dola got on my nerves with her moans and shit. she is so dam useless and her only purpose is staying naked every 5 minutes. like i just wanted exit the episode at that point.
enjoyment:
 i can say that i didn't enjoy this anime PROUDLY. it's shit i'm sorry to the fans out there. it's honestly all over the place and the only reason why i stayed is because of the pretty colors and the jojo references. 
overall:
overall, this anime wasn't what people were saying. i literally didn't see why it was so hyped 😀 it's shit. end of my review.",3,girlwiki

                hi i never write reviews ever! but im here to tell you why i think you should not waste your time on no game no life!!
the overall story, the universe, the concepts, art, and music? all fine! even good! 
i think there's a lot of potential for the series! i found myself invested in the story and i can understand why people might praise NGNL...
*BUT.*
the never-ending stream of incestuous ecchi makes the series completely unwatchable!
personally, im not a fan of harem, fanservice, or ecchi in the first place, but i can absolutely look past it for an otherwise good series. (some of my fav animes
                  are chobits and kill la kill! both very guilty of these things, but i love them anyway.) 
personal preferences aside, for how much praise the series gets, this is a huge, glaring flaw!! the show is excessive in reminding you that shiro is the 11 year old younger sister, and then takes EVERY opportunity for panty shots, bathing/undressed scenes, and sexual jokes towards her. it feels constant. have you forgotten for even a moment that sora and shiro are unhealthily close in a creepy sexual way? no worries, the show will remind you again with dialogue about how jealous shiro is of all the other girls stealing sora's attention! they try to play it off as sora and shiro ""being shut ins"", which might excuse their dependent relationship. but the anime absolutely could have explored an overly dependent sibling relationship without sexualizing it. shiro's age is very apparent yet she's sexualized right alongside the other harem support characters, as if she's just another romantic interest. even by anime standards, it's unbearable.  
i really wanted to like NGNL!! the games, the fantasy universe, and some of the characters are really cool in concept!! but overall it was such a disappointment. i sat through so many uncomfortable and annoying scenes hoping it would get good. there are other, more average flaws with the show, which doesn't help its case. the story doesn't accomplish much with its one season, some of the other characters feel flat and sexualized to the point that it takes away from their personality, and emotional character development is nonexistent. i haven't bothered watching the movie because i can't imagine it's able to do much to fix the issues and further the plot of the whole series in such a short time span. i can't speak for how the manga handles these things, but as far as the anime is concerned, it is very flawed and incomplete.

Sora and Shiro were two intelligent step siblings who basically complimented eachother in the way they acted. Sora being a desperate virgin and Shiro being a perverted eleven year old.

They did well to keep you on the edge as far as how they're going to get out of certain situations.

                2nd Review I've Done In Total.
Story - The story is of Shiro and Sora, siblings, who come across an e-mail. They play a 'human' who asks if they ever felt like they have felt like they don't belong in this world. After they win the game they get transported to a new world. They learn the rules of the 'game' and go on their journey of becoming god and conqering the world.
Art - The art was vibrant, well thought out, and I loved the little parody of other anime you could find in there. I thought the use of such vibrant colors was eye-catching and
                  although though people thought that was the only reason people fawn over this series. I loved the art because it depicted this fantasy world extremely well and showed us how Earth is just plain and bare while the new world was vibrant and full of life.
Sound - I thought the sound was very well. The voice actors didn't sound like robots. Shiro's voice actress did the whole quiet, emotionless little girl thing very well. I like those kind of characters. They quite remind me of Kanade and Julie and Shiina. 
Character - The characters were a little cliche I admit. An introverted video game otaku boy who was also... as most teenage boys are... perverted and virgin. I thought Shiro was cliched with her quiet, emotionless, introverted self... Stephanie was the embarassed yet in love character and Jibril was the character not afraid to show herself
Enjoyment - I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I thought the style, the humour, and the story was great. I've watched this 2x and I admit I binge watch it the whole time. It's hard for me to binge watch a bad show. If I'm watch average or good shows I just switch around with them, but I couldn't do it with this piece of art.

                  out of the world, and just play videogames all day and all night with his younger stepsister, Shiro. She's the only one, whom he loves (if you ask me, he loves her too much...). One day the Step-siblings get into a game, which have rules. With these rules, they need to defeat Tet, the god of games. They meet with many characters, and what I can say, Sora and Shiro together are really genius and foxy, and they always find out the trick of the opponent players. Their logic is brilliant.
But logic and intelligence is not everything. This might be really great anime (because of the complex gameplay), but arrogancy is unforgivable sin at me. I understand, why such animes, like No Game No Life are very popular: Sora and Shiro might refer to those anime fans, who can't find their place in real life. Because they count unique between ""normal"" people (We should talk about who counts normal...) and they think they are exiled from real life. Well, I feel it, I also felt like exiled, because people generally hardly accept me. But virtual life is not real life. And I appreciate those stories much more, which shows, how can an ""exiled"" human find their way in real life. Because everybody has its place in life. And those animes, which give that feeling, it's good to reprobate people, place them in an ""alternative"" world, or virtual world, that unforgivable to me. I will never ever accept the popularity of this anime.
The music also rather awful to me. I don't like Suzuki Konomi's voice, because I never heard emotions in her voice. Her singing ability is relatively ok, but every time, when I hear her singing, I feel like, she's a cosseted girl, who has been raised in shell (as we express the protected children in hungarian), but doesn't know much about the real life. Singing ability and beauty is one thing, but the lack of emotions underrates singing career to me.
Well, this is a hateful and disgusting anime. I don't care of the protagonists are smart and foxy, if they are arrogant as well, and if the anime shows it's ok if you want to hide in the virtual life, that's unforgivable at me.",2,supermario4ever

                NGNL doesn't take itself too seriously, which is why I gave it a higher score. If you're going into this anime thinking it's going to have a deep story, then you'll be disappointed.
NGNL has some fan service, I wouldn't say it's over the top, but if you hate fan service it might make you think less of the anime. The plot was good enough to keep me watching without getting bored. It has decent comedy in the right places. There are parts that are suppose to be serious(?) that seem out of place, but they're not often. 
It doesn't feel that rushed compared to other
                  12 Ep seasons, but it definitely should've had 15-20 in my opinion.

I literally dropped this at episode 6 and had to force myself to finish it because everyone was like ""Wow best isekai ever."" they were wrong. Best isekai is the first episode of SAO. Soras only traits are being clever and being a pervert. I wasn't even paying attention towards the end. The only redeeming feature is the art. Its amazing and i love the art. I haven't read the light novel (i think its a light novel) because it wasn't even the

                You are probably wondering why this show is so popular. It's not pinpointed to the characters or plot, but rather, the strange and unique setting. I'll explain.
I will be frank here. Every time I rate an anime well (7+), I'm extremely critical. And every time I rate an anime badly (6-), I emphasize why I chose the score so any viewer who happens to have different tastes and would take those points as a good thing instead of something that hinders the show will have fair insight as to watch it or not.
For this show, I will start with the good points and then switch
                  over to the things that bothered me.
I will say this: No Game No Life is clever. Forget the plot. Forget the personalities of the characters. By now, assuming you've read the description of the anime, you know that the show is about games — but really, specifically, it's about solving puzzles. The main characters are constantly faced with deception and manage to overcome it in the most bizarre ways. I'm guessing that's why people found it so intriguing and why, despite being constantly irritated by a few aspects, I somehow can't stop watching it. No matter how pissed you are at this anime — and I was totally pissed — the one thing it does not lack is something interesting.
Ok. There you go. I've done my good deed for the day. On to the bad part.
Deep breath.
Characters:
There are two main characters, and a few side ones. But the two main ones are Sora, a sly and arrogant guy whose quirky and fun side does not quite make up for his OP-ness and confidence; and his sister, Shiro, who I will get to later...because I've got a lot I want to say about her.
Why does Sora piss me off? I'll split it into 3 reasons, which I will describe my best, so if you aren't as pissed, you won't miss this otherwise pretty good anime.
1) Sora is too OP
No, as of right now I have not finished this anime. But as of right now, I'm far enough (10/12 episodes) into the show that I can say there is just no character development. Sora is completely flat throughout the entire show. The writers or whoever made up this character decided that as long as he wasn't a complete douche, as long as there was some ecchi to make up for it, they could cover it up. Normally, I wouldn't mind a shallow MC, as long as they had a painful past that could be expanded a bit or they lost once or twice to their opponent; but Sora never does that. Not once does he lose his cool and not once does he stop being arrogant enough for me to want to punch him.
At first I found this attitude likable. I mean, he represented humanity and went against the other races to climb to the top. But then he never changed and his personality went from confident to arrogant to cruel.
2) Ecchi
I'll be blunt: I hate ecchi and harems. So if you don't mind or you like it, just don't bother reading this. 
I usually go out of my way to watch shoujos, not because I particularly liked the genre, but because harem squads are almost never present in female-targeted audiences. I made an exception because this anime happened to be in the 101st spot in the Top Anime list and it didn't have explicit violence or nudity scenes, which I was tired of. By that point, I was desperate, so I eagerly picked it up. That being said, while the ecchi is light and comedic to give some leeway to people  like me, I still don't like it. It's forced, it's dirty, and it's disgusting. The MC abuses females despite this being PG-13 and while the interesting plot tries to make up for it...it just doesn't make up for it. The women shove themselves on top of him like dogs (with one of them even being portrayed as a dog in one episode), and I just about reached my limit when I decided to let off steam on this review.
3) Shiro
And here it comes: The ultimate finish.
Shiro.
Shiro is one of those quiet, kind-of-tsundere-but-not-really girls who somehow wiggle their way through every problem. Talk about a flat character. The writers or directors or whoever tried to make her better by giving her an episode to prove herself but she's just...too bland. She offers a few remarks here and there, shows off her awesomely clever brain once in a while, and that's about it.
And that's it for the review. There's nothing more to say. You might wonder, then why did I rate it so high? Because I can see why people are attracted to this one. I can really see why. But, despite my addiction, it's just not enough.",7,tapbeat
19815,"
                This anime suffers from characters that are obnoxious, writing that is predictable and overall just mediocre storytelling. 
Stop making anime that falls into the same shitty Isekai tropes of people being gods whenever they are ""reborn"" into a new world. 
Nobody wants to watch an anime where you have Einstein 1 and Einstein 2, who by the way are shut-in NEETS, being so OP that they end up ruling humanity by the 4th episode.
Progression is important. Characters being weak is important. It's how we learn to empathise with characters. When you have characters that are perpetually good at every game and don't have to stop
                  and do introspection, you fail to fulfill one of the core tenets of GOOD writing.
Compare this to something like Konosuba. Both are Isekai, but at least Konosuba makes its protagonist actually act like a NEET yet whilst retaining his own character.  Also the protagonist is actually allowed to both be weak or strong at certain times, so he progresses over time. Whereas the male protagonist here...well he's meant to be a NEET but he has more confidence in his gaming ability than Magnus Carlson. It just doesn't fit.
Overall just a bad, overrated anime that lacks fulfilling characters who are obviously fan-service to the audience.",5,Mackson2002

                6 years we've waited for a season 2, and no real end in site, the movie is a prequel and not counting towards this going farther into the story. Even with that, we will wait because honestly this show is amazing. its one of the few shows id give a 10/10, the rewatchability is strong in this one. This being about my 4th rewatch and i could watch the whole thing again and not be disappointed.
i see so many people hating on it, because they come into it expecting something else, or having watched other things about it, or having a different experience with the
                  show, mirroring the quotes that they seem to dislike said by one of the protagonists. the world is massive, its large, the rules are unclear, there is no set way to win, btu the human spirit wants to be right, so we continue to try and be the way we thing we need to be to win. 
that being said, i love this show.  as i said weve been waiting 6 years, and all weve had are movies and side stories, but some of us will keep holding this torch.",10,HellenicHg

                Often I thought to myself, why bother watching a show with an overpowered protagonist. I thought that those kind of stories lack any kind of tension. This show has not one but two of that kind and it doesn't even hide this at all. But why do so many people enjoy said ho nonetheless? That a the mindset I went into the series and it answered that question for me and even more became one of my favorite anime to date. So I decided to bring my experiences No Game No Life brought to me on this platform.
Story(8/10):
First of all the story is pretty solid
                  but not really the most orginal..It's heart lies in the games presented that are for the most part pretty creative. Other than that regard it is a typical isekai. But even though it is not a special story structure, it is delivered pretty good. The first episode explains almost everything you need and that without getting boring or repetitive. And the rest is just building up to a greater conflict. With all that said the story isn't it's strongest point but enjoyable nevertheless.
Art(10/10):
One of the strongest points of the anime. The Art is extremely amazing. You have vivid colors, strong character designs(like expected from a harem anime), and the style even changes based on the protagonists mood what i personally love. Madhouse has done an amazing job in designing  the artstyle.
Sound(8/10)
The sound design is a more of mixed bag for me.On the one hand No Game No Life has many rather forgetable soundtrack but on the other hand this anime has one ofthe greatest songs i've ever heard in an ost on it's roster in kings game. And the Op is one of my favorite songs I have ever heard. The Ed is pretty decent too. In the end the emotional impact from the few very good songs saves it in this category.
Character(9/10): 
Like I said normally I am not the biggest fan of Overpowered mcs but I love Sora and Shiro, especially Sora. They both are the strongest together. I love their dynamic as blank. I love Soras genius mind in terms of strategy. But the harem... I the rest of the cast is also pretty likeable. The in comparison rather dumb dora that is not really  socially awkward unlike blank and the psycho that is jibril. It is a bit of a shame that clammy and feel don't get much screentime as of now. 
Enjoyment(10/10):
This Anime is pure fun and I myself love it because of the creative games as I am a big enthusiast of board and card games myself. I love the mindgames that are present in the series for that reason. It is one of the most enjoyable anime for me just because it is fun. Even though you know that blank will win it all, the fun comes from ho they will win, how will they outsmart their opponents. The enjoyment comes from the journey not from the result. 
Overall(10/10): 
Objectively it shouldn't be a 10 out of 10 if you calculate the numbers from above together but screw it. I love this Anime on every aspect, so the 10/10 is more of a subjective rating. I love everything from this Anime, the concept with the games, the fantastic surreal vivd artwork presented, the mindgames in every game, the intensity in every game, the song kings game that sends a chill down my spine every time I hear it, the opening that I saved on my playlist on youtube, the comedic scenes, the ecchi( even though it can  be to much at times in NGNL), the references to other works etc. It is not a deep or philosphical anime so if you search for something like that than don't bother try it. NGNL is just conveying one big message: 
Commandment 10: Let's all have fun together.

                Warning possible Spoilers
Here's an idea give a brother and sister a huge ass IQ who are amazing at games and send them into a world full of colours where disputes are settled by games then you have one hell of a recipe for epicness.
The story centres around Sora and Shiro who are incredibly smart and amazing at games, but they are bored and looking for a challenge so Tet the God of another world called Disboard takes them there and thus the brother and sister's lives will forever change.
I loved the story seeing two absolute Genius's who love to play games and are taken to
                  a world where disputes are settled by games is just amazing, but the best part is seeing these two creatively outsmart their opponents in the games because some of them last for a couple of episodes at a time, but they are so entertaining to watch because the outcome is unexpected and friggin genius.
It's also interesting seeing how this world works though the games since it has a lot of rules when it comes to winning or losing the games like for example both players have to deem something that is of equal value and whoever wins gets the opponents value so knowing the rules and then seeing what the consequences or rewards can be when they are playing these games can be really intense, there are also 16 races in this world and it was again very interesting to see how powerful each race was and of course humans are the weakest since there is magic in this world we don't really have any special abilities, but seeing Sora and Shiro prove otherwise is certainly inspiring.
The characters are absolutely amazing Sora and Shiro together or even separately aren't people to be underestimated because despite their social awkwardness which was very funny at times like when in episode 2 Stephanie got angry and separated them you can see how much they need each other otherwise they'll break down, but otherwise they are a force to be feared and there is a reason for why they call themselves blank because they never lose.
As separate characters Sora the brother is the older of the two and is certainly a bit of a douchebag mainly because of his and Sora's extreme intelligence, but he does have a good heart which he does show from time to time and is really all his sister has that's family so there are points where you see his kind side, but he also has a perverted side because for someone who is 18 and is a complete shut in then suddenly enters a world that has some pretty good looking female characters you're gonna get desperate which is shown with Sora quite a few times, however it made for some excellent comedy.
Shiro the sister of the two is definitely one of the most adorable characters ever I mean just look at her you can't say no to a face that cute and she is probably the smartest 11 year old I have encountered so far in anime I could be wrong, but she is incredibly smart just like her brother and she also has a brother complex which to me is pretty weird, but I let it slide because her brother doesn't feel the same way so I'll just leave it be, Shiro's personality is much different to Sora's since she doesn't express a lot of emotions and is mainly monotone when she speaks though that doesn't stop from making hilarious situations happen like when she pushed Sora onto Stephanie resulting in a awkward situation and there is a point where it shows she needs her brother because despite being a genius she has difficulty when it comes understanding emotions and other peoples behaviours which did become a problem in one game so you can see that the bond between these two is very strong.
There are other characters like Stephanie who is the first major character that the siblings meet in Disboard and is the granddaughter of the deceased human king, she can be expressive and emotional at times which will probably annoy some people, but to me it is entirely understandable because even she doesn't do well at games which the siblings constantly pick on her because of this, but she is surprisingly smart and cares greatly for Humanity and believes in the potential that they have in this world and this is improved even greater when she sees the victories that the siblings achieve against the other races plus she's a good looking character so she was always great to see around.
There is also Jibril who is a Flugel and encounters the siblings when they wanted the National library for it's knowledge and after she is defeated she joins the siblings, her character is very sporadic and energetic making her a funny character to have around plus she is also on a huge quest to gain knowledge herself hence why she had the library so seeing two entirely new people from a different world would hugely peak her interest.
The artstyle was so good that when I watched this for the first time it hurt my eyes the colours were that bright, putting that aside it really did look amazing did the world of Disboard hell I would like to go there and the same can be said for the characters because they look very colourful too which I really liked, there were some places like Humanity's capital or when the siblings were fighting against Jibril that really showed how amazing this show could look.
The action was really good seeing the battles between the siblings and their opponents was just unforgettable like for example the first big battle which was chess, but this wasn't ordinary chess and it was really interesting when the rules would just suddenly change making the siblings have to think of something else to defeat their opponent would put me on the edge of my seat, the same can be said for other battles including the big final one against the Werebeast Race.
The comedy was really funny seeing the siblings constantly pick on Stephanie was enjoyable yet I did feel sorry for her since she didn't really deserve it, but whenever they make fun of the other races or got cocky it was really just a site to behold at times, there is also Ecchi or fan service, but it isn't too bad not to the point where it takes me out of the show, although I have to admit there were some juicy moments that peaked my attention.
The one thing I have against this anime and what stops it from getting any higher is the ending it is so annoying that it ended on a huge cliffhanger especially when we may never get another season, but hey at least we're getting a prequel movie so maybe there's something we can get out of it.
Overall this is another anime that has really smart and strategic characters who were really entertaining to watch and had a really interesting world and characters to go with so if you're into strategy with comedy and a lot of colours then check this anime out.",9,Tyrannicswine117

                I was genuinely excited going into No Game No Life. It seemed to have a sufficiently interesting and distinct premise to rise above the mass of isekai we've have in recent years. Add to that its stunning and unique visual style and a banger of an OP (which for good reason is pushing 100 million views on Youtube) and the combined package seemed like something I could get into. 
My excitement abated fairly quickly. I think the first alarm bells were the introductions of the two main characters. I was not five minutes in before I was getting distinctly concerned about where these characters would
                  be taken. Certainly, at this point it was obvious that Sora was not going to be nearly as far removed from your run of the mill isekai protagonist as one might have hoped. And with Shiro, I wondered, were we going to get a one-note support act along with some wholly unwanted Loli fan-service and incest themes? Well Sora has perhaps even less character depth than the much-maligned Kirito, while the entire supporting cast seems to exist purely to praise him on how clever he is. Meanwhile, I wasn't off the mark on Shiro either. Our protagonists are of course not blood-related so we have that wonderful trope at play, but one trope we don't have at play is the, ""Yeah, she looks like a Loli and all, but she's actually 800 years old."" Because, no, Shiro is actually just 11. And sure enough there are multiple scenes of sexualised (sorry, 'comedic'/'entirely justified by the not-at-all wildly improbable context') nudity from this literal child. Gag.
Anyway, I suppose I should offer some commentary on the other characters. We have Steph who exists to lose her clothes and be the butt of jokes and for seemingly no other purpose. The writers occasionally make a half-hearted attempt at demonstrating her relevance, but these are dubious at best. 
Then there's Jibril who always steals every scene she's in. Indeed she's probably the only remotely memorable character in this show. It almost seems like a shame she was wasted here - I think it could be genuinely interesting see a character like her given a more interesting cast of characters to interact with. Oh well.
Kurami fills out the main cast and is... fine. She's marginally more compelling than our two protagonists, but not by much and is not nearly as memorable as Jibril in her somewhat vacillating role in the show's narrative. 
So what of the show's setting? Well as one of the elements that initially intrigues me it largely stands up, at least in the big picture. An uncharitable critique might be that it is overly formulaic and doesn't feel very real, but given this is a world entirely based on games, rules and structure are essential to making this premise work and it is interesting enough to facilitate the suspension of disbelief. This is not a world intended to be realistic, but if one engages it on its own terms, it genuinely works. 
The problem comes with the minutiae of the world-building. The world doesn't feel very big or lived-in. Despite frequent crowd shots and references to the three million citizens of Elchea, there are so few actual characters that these all just end up feeling like NPCs at most. The other issue, that exacerbates this is the pace with which the show escalates its scale, leaving the viewer with no actual time to get a sense of the place before we are forced into the bird's eye view the characters soon adopt.
The races in this fantasy world are derived from the usual millieu of Tolkien/D&D types, but they are given enough distinctive traits for them to feel relatively fresh. This also means each new encounter is genuinely interesting, when the viewer gets to discover more about the world's inhabitants. 
The narrative is where things are truly let down. It is staggeringly predictable and provides for very little suspense, moving clumsily from one set-piece to another. Early on there were some indications that these set-pieces might be constructed in a genuinely intriguing manner to take maximum advantage of the show's games gimmick. Instead, however, we are rapidly presented with 'brilliant' game-winning stratagems from the protagonists that couldn't possibly have been discerned by the viewer from the information given by the show before they are revealed. Many seem to rely on wildly improbable luck or frankly suspension of disbelief-defying levels of super-human mental acuity. This latter aspect puts a lie to the show's recurrent theme of overcoming weakness with ingenuity, since the protagonists' successes never really come to them through any genuine ingenuity, rather they come because they essentially have magical powers that no human could possess.
As said before, a significant part of the role of the supporting cast is to praise Sora for his brilliance. This is how the show tells the audience that they too should be impressed. But it really does nothing to earn this. If it gave the audience a sufficient understanding of the games to begin with, it might be possible to appreciate the strategies at play, but after dabbling with this idea early on, it soon abandons it. After that it seems to mostly make up the rules of the games we're shown as it goes along. There are some exceptions, but they are few and far between. 
The series ultimately seems more interested in keeping up a steady serving of fan service that ranges from the ho-hum to the downright icky, than building on its characters, creating an engaging story, or further fleshing out its world. There's a lot to look at here with its beautiful animation, but that wears thin when there's no substance underneath. 
Overall, if a second season ever does get released (and word seems to be that it's finally happening), I'll probably watch it because I still feel there's potential burrowed deep down in this premise. But it'll have to make some pretty drastic changes to build on this incredibly lackluster first season.",4,SRMcQuillan

                The story is about the shut-in siblings Sora and Shiro, a gamer duo, who are summoned to a world by the God of Games, Tet. This world, unlike their world, governed by games. Everything is decided by games and a set of rules which were to be strictly followed. Thus starts their journey in the land of their dreams.
Personally, I found Sora to be the most entertaining character in the anime, be it comedy or intensity, he played it out the best. On the other hand, the brother-sister drama was way too mawkish. In some parts, even obnoxious.
Incidents that occurred in the game of chess
                  were aimed to be ingenious but rather turned out to be cringey. The acts were very far from being logical, specifically the formation of a rebellion, which looked like a biased stepping stone towards their victory. 
Despite some of the above mentioned flaws, the series was great in terms of plot and execution of psychological aspects.",8,sushrut1058

Nice!:
- The world and lore of this anime is pretty interesting, with lots of unanswered stuff to look forward on the sequels. The rules within the world of NLGL works consistenly well on the actions and premises of the characters' action and behavior.
- The art style is amazing! I was kind of annoyed with the red tint at first, but when the world meshes in and was revealed, it was a really done well. Bright dominant colors added with surreal landscape art really got me.
- One of the best OPs I've seen/heard so far :) This is veeerry nice! for me, and
                  I usually skip the opening scene once I get tired of it, but as for this one, I rarely skipped the OP.
Meh...:
- Characters kind of felt overpowered, or rather over intelligent. No problem with that essentially but somehow, any conflicts that'll going to be thrown at them will make you think ""They're going to solve/conquer it anyway"", but the way they do think is entertaining at best so there's that, but it kinda irked me so slightly knowing that they'll figure it out sooner or later.
- It kind of felt like the typical Shounen tournament arc for me, where there's an enemy to defeat, posing this kind of threat, but then after defeating it, another one comes along, with greater risks and rewards. Good thing, however, is that the formula here is kind of fresh, with solid strategies and mathematical approach to the conflict, not just some traditional untapped power from the protagonist will emerge or some sort, so that kind of still made me invested in the show. 
- There were some comedies that was entertaining, but there are times where you'll need a certain Japanese media reference that really didn't get to me, and it can be a little bit awkward to those that are new in this kind of media. And overall, the comedic experience are mostly dependent on fanservice. Speaking of which....
Ugh:
- Fanservice, really, until to the very last... *sighs* I won't go much on with this, but yeah, it's really your typical fanservice.
- Little or no significant character development, particularly with the two protagonists, Sora and Shiro. I know, the show focuses more on the development of the settings and state between the factions, but due to the little room for development on the character of the casts, it just doesn't went well with me. They just really didn't relate to me (even if they were perceived as NEETs :)) )
- The supporting characters, mainly Steph and Jibril, kind of stuck to me as ""fanservice dumps"" over the whole series. Yeah, they did have their good moments, but born from the stemmed shallow characterization which at the end, puts again the protagonists in a much higher pedestal than them on how they handle their moments. But since its the rules of the world they're in, I guess I have to stick with that.
- And remember folks, incest will never be wincest! I just didn't understand why they have to set a somewhat uncomfortably intimate relationship with both the protagonists. Whew....
Overall, I still liked the show, and will add the movie and OVA in my watch list as well as their sequel. But I probably won't go beyond the Light Novels.

(Note Well !!!!!!!!! 
This anime does not finish. It's at best the equivalent of the first book in a trilogy. Know that before anything else!!! )
Next up, this anime is in desperate need of a good solid deconstruction.  No spoiler here. The MC's get isekaied to a world that operates under the following rules
1 All bloodshed, war, and pillage is forbidden throughout the world.
2 All disputes are to be resolved through the outcome of games.
3 In games, wagers will be made on what both parties decide to be of equal value.
4Unless contrary to ""Three"", the
                  game content and the things wagered do not matter.
5The challenged party has the right to decide the contents of the game.
6 ""As per the Oath"", the wager will be !!!! UNCONDITIONALLY !!!!!! adhered to.
7 All matters for group conflicts will be decided by a representative.
8 If cheating is detected during a game, it will be regarded as a defeat.
9 The above rules are unconditionally everlasting, upheld in the name of God.
10 Everyone should get along while playing games.
You're expected to believe  the above would produce a fun light hearted world even while turning a blind eye to the abuse the main characters make of the rules. That's a problem that runs through this show. You can use the bet to take someone's freedom, self awareness, species identity, existence.
If the creators were gamers they would of realized those rules would have created a crapsack world that make's Dante's inferno look like a tourist destination. 
Ok you can overlook the fact that those rules really aren't going to work out well at all. Gotta suspend disbelief a little. It's fantasy after all. 
What's impossible to swallow,is that this has been the case for decades to centuries, and nobody actually that actually lives there than can think further ahead than making a wager. What's more nobody ever bothers actually using the cheating rule to reverse their losses. It's really painful to watch every time it happens and it happens a lot!!
Working past that man the characters are painful. Shiro and Sora are painfully OP. There are parts of them that are well done, those parts unfortunately may make your skin crawl and invoke an urge to back away slowly and quietly from them. The rest are just plain awful. I mean really awful. 
Needless to say in an anime about gaming, games are going to be really important. Theiy're the real supporting characters here. Trouble is they are bad.  Not as bad as the human characters but still pretty bad. The players never ask questions about the rules, as mentioned before you have obvious and outright cheating going on that's never brought up, and more often than not, it takes plot armor in the form of one or more characters throwing the games against their own interests. 
Overall it's really mediocre. If you want the fanservice, just go straight to hentai and enjoy.",5,kawaii123456

                Characters aside No Game No Life has an incredible story with great animation, sound, and twists. The protagonists, however, really pissed me off so much that I could barely watch the show at its end. Sora is just a straight up dick that treats everyone else like trash and his sister, while a little bit better, is pretty much the same. If you can get over the fact that the protagonists are complete assholes and how annoying it is that everyone just goes along with it then the show will be absolutely worth it for you then. I'm actually hoping for a second season and

it was the first anime I've ever watched, and it makes me really nostalgic. 
the art is amazing, the characters are developed and unique. 
to those looking for a random anime to watch, this will be the best one for you.
what i love about this anime is the art. they make the world so colorful and bright, but at the same time, make it look like it has a deeper meaning, yk what i mean?the characters face many twists and problems, and you'll be surprised at how great this anime is written.
sora and shiro's sibling bond is what makes this anime truly a masterpiece.

Except this one and its I enjoyed this series 
To Put it simply I believe this anime had a strong hold on where it wanted to go and who it wanted to inspire. Sure it is eye candy but the bottom line is that this dominated the ""in another world"" genre because it gave viewers much more then basic rpg elements or over the top copy paste combat and magic. Instead it mashed those old cliches together with all kinds of games and made them interesting again which is very refreshing because those are games I played as a child.
The soundtrack is superb
                  for the upbeat and techy music that you don't hear much in anime. I often find myself coming back to my playlist just for Tet's theme alone.
Characters could use a little more polishing but the relationships are well built, not much else I can say since this is spoiler free

Such is the premise of No Game No Life. The ecchi sure exists, but you will be too busy gawking at the ridiculously high-stakes ""fights"" to care (the Kill la Kill principle - if you disliked KLK as of episode 3, this anime is probably not for you). The anime is beautifully drawn and you just won't be able to stop gawking at how ridiculously extra the games and their players can be.
Also, there are no less than
                  three JoJo references in a one-cour anime.
There are only two reasons why you might dislike this anime:
1) You don't like Kill la Kill. (Understandable, have a great day.)
2) You don't want to watch a dead anime out of an ongoing light novel series. (Understandable, have a great day.)

                I'm on episode 4 right now, so far it's funny and over the top. I'm not a big fan of the incestuous animes, creeps me out (maybe this is supposed to be a parody). I don't really like still-shots of the animations because it's just a very blurry saturation as if someone got really faded and went to Candyland.
One thing I disagree on in the chess portion, the main character acts very high and mighty but has no idea about the history of the real world. Dictators don't normally get killed at all, i.e. Stalin, Castro, Korean family of Kim's, Chinese Mao's, many more...

                There are only two things to talk about;
1- The games; Without wishing to spoil anything (As if the title doesn't give it away) the show is entirely about playing competitive games, in which the protagonist (Shiro and Sora , two siblings) are pitted against nearly impossible odds, gambling away very valuable objects  but somehow come out ahead.
The tactics that they use to overcome seemingly insurmountable problems are extremely interesting to watch in execution but even more interesting after it becomes explained. It is one of those things that keeps the viewer on their toes (if he should so want) or can be enjoyed as
                  popcorn anime without putting much thought into it. 
By the way; Sora (The Protagonist) is a con artist and it is glorious.
And 2.... everything else.
Basically, the ""Game"" aspect and the explanations by themselves would be a 10 out of 10 ... however, everything else is very flimsy; The world is underdeveloped, the characters are very flat and one-dimensional... the ""Comedy"" is repetitive and relies heavily on references to other shows. The ""drama"" (If you could laughably called it that) is overplayed and quite weak. It has a lot of fanservice but it's PG-13 ish fanservice and I hate that.
But let's talk about the characters, specifically the three protagonists;
Sora: Male protagonist insert.
He is a NEET and apparently horrible at social situations. He has no friends aside from his sister and is , for all intents and purposes a completely inept loser with no future. He relishes being thrust into the new gameworld (Disboard) and wants to proceed into it with reckless abandon.  Super intelligent, super devious, super cunning, super quick on his feet (witty); He is pretty much maximum wish fulfillment for men. 
I enjoyed it, but he is very poorly written as a character however it works within context of the show.
Shiro; Loli chara. Computational genius that wants Onii-chan to take his Imouto and everything that that implies.... anyway she is very flat; The core of her character is that she is incredibly intelligent, and yet she falters an awful lot. She is there to take some of the edge off of Sora and show he is fallible. It should not work in paper, but because of the medium by which they develop (Games) it works very well. 
Again, she is poorly written but it works.
Stephanie Dora; Useless character.
She is initially introduced as somewhat of an audience surrogate but is then relegated to being utterly pointless. She is mainly used in filler scenes where she is the local fanservice girl (Mmm not that I am complaining) and the butt of many jokes. She has low intelligence and in general, is not very interesting or at all even.
These are the best developed characters; Basically the characterization is awful.
However... there is a fourth character called ""Tet"" who we are given only glimpses of, this character has several mysteries about him and while that does not count as characterization, what we are not told shapes him sort of like water takes the shape of the container it is in.
""Tet"" was the most interesting character if only because there are so many questions as to what he is doing and why.... alright let's proceed.
The ""Story"" is atrocious. There is no real major arc, it's just stuff that happens... theoretically there is a starting point and an end goal but the majority of what happens is just a bunch of messing around. I know that was a short summary but the show basically has no story. I am not joking.
Basically it is recommended on two fronts;
- If you are a nerd like me and love game theory (GAME THEORY IS LIFE), then this is a magnificent adaptation of the concepts of game theory with large breasted anime girls thrown in (Yum yum). The writing is very rich and velvety. 
- Watch if you want a colorful popcorn anime with fanservice , anime references and games being played (Disregard tactics and tautology of game theory in no game no life).
Do not watch if;
- You want an intricate story
- You want complex, well developed characters
- You dislike fanservice
- You dislike long explanations before, during and after scene
- You want a well developed, rich game world

                As other review I read said it feels like a self insert for neets, traveling to a video game world to escape reality and then lust after all this h0t girls and his 11 year old sister *vomit*, obviously Sora is this OP Gary Stu he can just outsmart every magical race at the final second of the game, and he’s always so cocky, Kūhaku always win I didn’t even feel relieved when they won like it just happened that’s it. Also the “hate” towards Steph felt like a self insert imo, like damn the MCs got jealous of this girl when they discovered she
                  went to school and was a top student and has a lot of friends and connections wth, and they punish her for it making her a dog for a whole day, even after that the MCs are so arrogant they keep humiliating this girl in any way. The constant incestuous relationship with his little sister was really uncomfortable to watch, the ecchi shots of this 11 year old girl are weird too, she gets jealous when she thinks other girls want to steal his brother, they also have a weird codependency relationship having like a panic attack when they’re not together.
Tbh I’ve watched a lot of other ecchi anime, it’s not a problem for me, but then a lot of y’all try to sell it as this deep profound anime, the story is really superficial, in a magical world even the games are basic af, really they couldn’t come up with something more original??, the MCs are too perfect you don’t feel invested in them, there’s no character growth because they’re already perfect there’s nothing to change, they’re just pretentious. I also feel like the majority of the ecchi scenes of Sira with another girl are with his 11 year old sis, like damn couldn’t the author at least pair him with a girl his age (he’s 18 btw), other ecchi scenes are when they make fun of Steph and of course Shiro is a perv too like touching her and making weird comments, and sexually embarrassing her.
Conclusion: Should you watch it? I mean it’s bad and there are boring moments, like you could watch it while having lunch just to have something to watch lol, but don’t expect this deep plot, the art is good is eye catching ngl, but yeah the incest aspect of this anime is just uncomfortable, sometimes I found myself moving the cursor just to see how much I had left because it was getting boring. If you just want to watch an ecchi there are way better ecchi out there, you want to watch a good isekai? You shouldn’t be here then.",4,Jutchan

                I watched this series about a month or two ago and enjoyed it thoroughly. A rough summary of the story is that Shiro and Sora are shut-ins that are insanely clever and masters at video games. One day, a mysterious email is sent to them, which contained a chess program. They originally thought that they're playing against a bot, but when the enemy makes a bad move, they know there is another player on the other side. When they win, they are transported to another dimension where every dispute, problem, and even the next ruler is decided by games, whether they be chess, poker, blackjack
                  or any other game of the sort.
The art was beautiful. I especially like the choice of outlining everything in red. I thought that the cast was well written (Sora and Shiro were def. relatable) and I enjoyed it very, very much. 9/10, def. would recommend.",9,TerrarianJosh

                A very good looking show with not much else.
Story 3: The story in this show is the worse part. The whole concept of the show seems so poorly thought of with overpowered main characters and absolutely no sense of danger of anything. the best part of the show is the last challenge that they face which saves it from being lower than a 3.
Art 9: and the art is the best part of the show. The show is very beautiful to look at with great use of vibrant neon colors on everything. Environments are over saturated in a tasteful way that makes this anime easy
                  to look at.
Sound 6: The sound design is not necessarily too memorable. I definitely don't remember anything bad about it and do remember a few good scores. But mostly negligible.
Character 4: The characters in this show are nothing special. The main characters are overpowered, there is only one male main character and every single female character is over sexualized including the 11 year old little sister of the main character who shows romantic interest and situations with. This made me uncomfortable.
Enjoyment 4: The show was somewhat engaging at first which drove me to watch the first 5 or so episodes in a timely manner but after that it became a chore to finish this. I found I had to force myself to watch just to finish it so I could move onto something else. Luckily the last two episodes are the most exciting of the whole show, though that is not saying much.
Overall 5: This show is very beautiful to look out and I suppose if you are just looking for a show with a lot of fan service and didn't care about the plot you may enjoy it. The most overrated show I have seen yet.",5,bunnyofthesea

                The one thing you notice about this anime is the art. It's so colourful that sometimes it hurts to look at. However, this is what makes it unique and very beautiful. The backgrounds are all equally as colourful and detailed as the foregrounds. 
Story was enjoyable, as well as most of the characters (and their designs). Characters weren't overly annoying. A bit too much fanservice though, that makes it kind of awkward to watch. 
Music wasn't anything special, and the opening/ending themes didn't seem to catch my attention much.

The soundtrack is decent, the characters and their development are a bit lacking, however. Its colorful colors compliment the playfulness of the show overall. 
I did feel that the highpoint of this series was the Shiritori game with Jibril - everything afterward felt a bit like things were just falling into place and setting up the next season. The game with Jibril showcased how playful and interesting a game can get

                Get thrown into yet another isekai. It's not as plot-heavy as rezero, nor as amusing as konosuba, it's just kind of all around fine
Studio: What an art style! So much neon you'll have you put on sunglasses, though it still strictly adheres to what we expect anime to be draw like. Actually, watching this just for the artwork is a good enough reason. Sound is also pretty good, with moments that really stand out and no glaring flaws. Studio's work was 10/10
Story: I actually found the story to be quite interesting. As long as you don't go out of your way to find plot holes,
                  it's decent. Much of the plot is centered around these ""games"" they play. While some of their ""games"" are won in a really unrealistic way, you'll find others have pretty clever logic behind them. In fact the whole world is quite unique in its emphasis on playing to win. The story overall wasn't outstanding or anything, though easily enough to keep you engaged
Characters: If you're looking for next level characters, you might want to try something else. For the amount of plot they try to get through, there is surprisingly little character development. That said, who needs character development when they're already great? Steph gives fan services all over the place, while also playing a pretty decent role as the comedic lead. Most the side characters are developed just enough for a 12 episode anime. The biggest gripe you may have in the protagonists' god-like being. They're a bit too perfect... However, they do get a short backstory each and definitely get our sympathy point of view. It's just there's nothing that outstanding about them, particularly in the isekai genre, which all too often has god-like leads
Comedy: The comedy here is not particularly great. There are maybe 3 or 4 instances that made me actually burst out laughing, as opposed to the 100 in something like love is war. They do make very specific Japanese gaming references, which are actually really amusing if you bother to search them up, however it lacks those wow comedy moments without getting them
So should you watch it? It's not spectacular on any account, except for maybe that artwork, though it's not really lacking anywhere either. If you're looking for a decent comedy anime it's not the worst choice
Side: There are a lot of lightly ecchi scenes. I'd still say they're years ahead of the usually dull fanservice, although your experience of the series will vary based on how much this bothers you",8,Voovs

My First Review And My First Ecchi Anime (As Far As I Know)
I always had a curiosity about this anime. 
Not only because of it's popularity, but also for it's high MAL score. 
I Never had the guts to try it though simply because it was ecchi (which I'm not a fan of).So Why try it now. I was almost 100% sure I would't try it. I mean. I don't like fan service! (that much)
""SO WHY YOU HYPOCRITE""!!
I'll tell you why. 2 reasons:
1. The pretty colors and the fact that Madhouse Animated it finally caught my attention.
2. It was leaving Netflix soon.
I'm here, to deliver a bland, quick, straight-forward review.
Story
It was... Fine. Solid really.
I Liked the idea and where it was trying to go with it. The execution was fine though. I can tell It's focus is on World-Building more than anything else. It grabbed me enough to move on to the next episode at the least. 6/10
Art
This Anime looks incredible. 
It probably has one of the most beautiful color pallets I've ever seen in a Show/movie.  
The Animation is by MadHouse. 
And It was good. But not Amazing, like you'd expect from MadHouse. 
There was not many fight scenes in Ngnl, so MH could't flex as much as I wanted them too but
eh
You get what you get I guess.
Overall, ngnl looks fantastic though. 9/10
Characters
Here's where I'm slightly conflicted. But I'l give it to you straight.
Most of the characters HAD Personality, but were kinda boring.
Sora
Without a doubt, the best character of the series.
Unlike the other boring and bland characters in the story, Sora was not only interesting but also a more unique take on an Isekai protagonist.
While most other Isekai leads are boring with no personality and masters anything in 1 episode,
Sora's different from the cliche because for one, 
He has a Personality. Ironically, he isn't a ""Blank"" Canvas. (heh) (I'm proud of myself for that one)
And going back to the ""mastering"" thing, he IS ""naturally"" good at playing games,
But that's because He had already pored his heart and soul into them. 
Before, Sora and his sister Shiro were summoned to this other game world, He (and his sister) were ""shut-ins"". Doing nothing but Video Games. 
So in a way, I'd be more weird if he Wasn't good at the games he played. 
Anyway, apart from that and his personality, He's a Static character. Which I thought was fine. 
In the end, Sora is a great character.
Shiro
The main female protagonist.
The younger and 'smarter' of the 2 sibling protagonists. 
I did't fell like she did ANYTHING of use to progress the story. 
Compared to her brother, she was lacking In both character and development. 
Put Simply, she was boring. She was only there for Incest.      (I'm Kidding)
Moving On.
Steph
The Useless Fan Service Character! yay.
TBH, I thought she was a fun character. 
At The Least, Her antics with Sora were entertaining, unlike Sora And Shiro, which felt empty.
But yeah, no development either. 
Jibril
...
Well,
I can't really said she was 'boring', just... weird and AGAIN not developed. Also fan service.
Izuna
The ONLY other interesting character. She was fun to watch and had decent chemistry with Sora.
I would have liked to see more of her in the series. 
Others
I literally had to look up what other characters where in the series because I could't remember them.
All the rest of them had no character or were just plain out uninteresting and unmemorable.
Overall (character wise) 6/10
Enjoyment
This series is fine. It's like a 6/10. But I had fun watching it. It was enjoyable and entertaining. Also the visuals were pretty awesome. It's more of a ""turn your brain off and just watch"" kind of show. 
7/10
Overall
I personally thought it was worth the watch.
But, If you, like me, were on edge about watching this dues to either Fan Service or Skepticism in popularity, they let me say this.
Give it a try. If you Don't like what You're watching then I wouldn't worry about ""if it gets better"".
Drop it if you want, because you're not missing much. It's an entertaining show with pretty colors and fan service. Apart from that it's not high quality in any other category. I would recommend if you want something fun. if not, don't bother.
One more note, If you Don't like fan service, you should pass on this one.

                I loved the anime and the rules of the world. You want to control the country, win a game. You want someone to do something for you, beat them in a game. I was worried that the games would be boring to me that I wouldn't want to continue. Luckily I was wrong. It had all the games be interesting in one way or another that I wasn't bored at all even if it was a game of chess because it had something happen to it that change the way it was played. The characters were somewhat interesting and likeable. Just not making me care.
                  I'll let that slide knowing that it was a short anime that needs a 2nd season defiantly because the story was surely not going anywhere. One thing that kind of hurt the season was the amount of fan service it had. Not that I hate fan service, it's just that enough is enough. If you are watching it for the story, there is none. The main Plot goes pretty much nowhere. Watch it for the games. Overall I liked the show and I would watch the 2nd season, if it gets one.",7,HalfSpeed

                Okay, so I know that a lot of guys are going to argue with me. They might even start a protest against me-_- but I am just gonna be honest about my own opinion. It doesn't necessarily mean that it is the same for everyone else. I had so much hope for this series, and it did have some good moments, but overall my experience and reaction to this series are meh.
It's near average for me. Many people have a wide variety of tastes. So I will definitely have to give my reasoning behind my opinion to everyone reading this. So lemme start from scratch.
                  No spoiler for new viewers so don't worry. If there is a spoiler I will mark it down.
--------------------------------------------------The good stuff!!!--------------------------------------------------------
This anime had a totally unique visual and soundtrack. I loved the RPG's music in between. Some dialogues are really awesome. And the comedy is really the only decent and proper thing here. I mean proper in an improper way. I mean it, you will definitely laugh and get into a good mood If you watch this. The character reactions are funny. All voice actors did a great job. It also introduced a new sort of idea. It was fast-paced and didn't waste time with useless details. The ending and opening are nice. And last but not least, The brother-sister duo is one of the most unique and awesome duos I have seen in anime.
--------------------------------------------------The bad stuff-------------------------------------------------------------
The story seemed trash. Yeah, I used that word out loud. Well given the genre it's okay, But I quite disliked it ngl. There should've been more character development or backstories. Such animes really need a back story. And a long one. But there aren't any. The concept of winning every game seemed too much for me. The team of that brother and sister is called ""___"" I mean ""Blank"". their chemistry is good but it didn't have any logic. The protagonist guy, Sora, character which was represented as the pinnacle of wisdom, He knew everything right off the bat. He thinks faster than light and has solutions to anything. And this ruined the taste. Most of the time it didn't feel like the character was smart or genius, rather felt like it was too overwhelming and too forced. The side characters were worse. Seemed like the protagonist was the god of wisdom and others were the god of stupidity. They didn't even have common sense. The ending, well.. uhmmmmm!!!!!!
Anyways overall I put it more on the bad side and less on the good side. So it was bad for me. Thanks for reading, Of course, watch it, It's nothing more than just hype. People who aren't into anime much are just bragging about it, But maybe you will like it. As I said at first, everyone has different opinions!

                No Game No Life is one of those animes that kept me on the edge of my seat with every episode. This anime offers an exciting and even inspirational story which left no filler episodes. A good soundtrack with one of the best openings of all of time.I loved the art style which game a sense of nostalgia. It totally works with the fantasy setting. The character design is also very memorable, Shiro being an iconic example. The characters themselves are very likeable and although sometimes they can be pretty rude and stupid, they still hold dear to my heart. Soras mental strength and love
                  for his sister cemented him as one of my favorite anime characters. 
No Game No Life has its shortcomings though. This anime is fanservice galore, which will irk a lot of people, but I personally didn't mind. The jokes are pretty much only about sex and weren't my taste. There's little character development with my biggest criticism being Steph. She was introduced as a punching bag and a punching bag she stayed.
Overall I really loved No Game No Life and I can easily say it's one of my favorite animes of all time. :)

                ""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS""
Overall, I thought the main story plot was interesting and fairly well done. The setting is quirky and unique in ways I thought were often good but the disparity in power between the various species in the setting was, frankly, unbelievably and unnecessarily absurd. But what hurt my enjoyment of the story the most revolved around the story being unbelievably biased toward the protagonists and the protagonists engaging in behavior that I found not only creepy but at times downright cruel and evil. More details on that below. 
I'm a fairly generous rater and would have rated this anime a few points
                  higher without those problems, but they bothered me enough to drop the rating and want to write a review to explain it. The spoilers below the *READ MORE* line, as per the review guidelines, deal with specific plot and character elements to explain what bothered me but not really spoilers about the overall plot.
*READ MORE*
There were 3 big issues had with this story that account for me knocking seveal points off of my score. I'll try to keep this as vague as I can, but the details I'm going to talk about will spoils some parts of the plot but they shouldn't spoil  the overall plot.
1) The setting lets the heroes get away with things they shouldn't reasonably be able to get away with for no reason but to let the characters do what they want. The heroes are a brother and sister team who are, together, unbeatable at games, but individually have weaknesses. At multiple points in the story, opponents let them both play together as one opponent or swap out at will without objection, which seemed like a ridiculous fudge to let them win in a world where players decide just about everything by winning games. No sane person would let an opponent tag-team with someone else like that. Basically, they're given a supposed disadvantage but the story rarely makes them have to deal with that disadvantage because it would break the plot. That's poor writing.
Another example is that one of the main pair wins a bet against another character who gambled for an unspecified ""small favor"" (how it's described in the English sub version), which will be enforced by the setting and the ""small favor"" the main pair character demands is that the other character love him, which the story treats as essentially giving the main pair complete control over the other character to do perverted and cruel things to her for the rest of the series (not a ""small favor""). That's akin to a story letting a character get away with wishing for more wishes and, again, is poor writing. And the purpose of it isn't even necessary for the plot in this case, which brings me to my next and perhaps biggest complaint...
2) The character Stephanie ""Steph"" Dola is the granddaughter of the previous king. From what we see of her, she's not the wisest or smartest girl but she's good and sincerely wants to help her people. She's a decent and nice person. After the main character forces her to fall in love with him as a ""small favor"", the 11 year-old sister of the pair states that her brother will be able to lose his virginity with her and then shoves him into her, where he proceeds to grope her vigorous until she shoves him off. While the brother declines to lose his virginity at that point, its not because they morally oppose the idea of compelling her to have sex and it's a potentially compulsion hanging over her head that she couldn't refuse if he decides to act on it. He can force her to have sex with him whenever he wants. The threat of rape isn't amusing.
Later on, they make her wear a skimpy maid outfit and the 11-year old sister tells her not to wear panties under it, humiliating her. When she loses yet another contest, they make her dress like a dog on a leash in front of her people and then as they take advantage of her stupidity leave her wearing nothing but a cloth wrap around her chest, a skimpy apron, doig colllar, and a dog tail shes wearing to cover her and the 11 year-old weaing her panties on her head because she wants to, implying what she has on doesn't really cover her privates via censorship circles. Further on, the brother records her and other women bathing and uses the images to humiliate them.  Not only has Stephanie Dola done nothing to deserve the cruelty shown her, but the story goes way beyond anything that could be written off as innocent or careless lewd hijinks and into cruel sexual humiliation. 
I get that people want ""fan service"". There is a scenario later on where she loses clothing down to her underwear during a competition and where they all lose their clothes but it's clear that their bodies are not lewdly detailed, and if the rest had stayed at that level, it would have been a lot better.
To drive home how vile the brother and sister can be with regard to sex, the brother wins a game by promising male participants the right to ""bang"" any woman they want to motivate them, presumably not caring if the woman actually wanted to be banged or not. Are the protagonists fine with rape or at least indifferent to it? Sure seems like it. 
And that scene also raises my first complaint. The brother simply promises that he'll let them bang *any* woman they want. He doesn't qualify it. That's exactly the sort of loophole the protagonists would use to do something vile. Of course we never actually see the protagonist have to make good on that promise because that would have illustrated just how horrible the protogonists are. Was it just a throwaway line meant for laughs? Maybe. But a very cringe-worthy one in light of their other sadistic behavior toward another main character.
I get that sexual naughtiness can be amusing and joked about, I get that they're anti-heroes, and I can even understand abuse of characters happening at the hands of villains, but this wasn't any of that and I couldn't overlook it. I pretty quickly reached the point where I wanted a real hero to rescue Stephanie Dola from the main characters as villains. The author make her moe and then has the main protagonists abuse her. Watching the main protagonists abuse, often sexually, a nice girl just isn't something I could enjoy and it spoiled much of the story for me since there is so much of it (it's not a minor one-time thing but a running theme).
I also get that the hero pair are supposed to be hikikomori with no social skills but is the point that obsession with anime and video games inevitably make hikikomori into amoral sadists like that? Do they really have to be depicted as narcissists or psychopaths? Do the author really want to hand that sort of depiction to critics and censors? 
And I get that maybe the point is that the story might include the main characters growing into decent people, and we do see some signs of compassion for Stephanie Dola later on, but the story puts them in a pretty big moral pit to dig themselves out of to find redemption and the way the characters are depicted, I don't see humility and penance bore being so nasty eing part of how they end up given how narcissistic they seem to be.
3) My last point is pretty much that the sister is 11. Beyond the sexual banter between brother and sister, which I don't get the appeal of including in so much anime, even if it's just for shock or comedy value, she's the source of a lot of the sexual torture of Stephanie Dola, presumably because she's jealous. I realize she's a drawn character and not a real little girl and I think there is some room for honest debate over how minors are depicted in anime, but the 11 year-old is prepubescent and her active participation in the sexual torture of another characer just went way too far into icky, creepy, and distasteful for me. The depiction of a childlike female character in the No Game No Life: Zero prequel was less creepy to me for a few reasons that would require spoilers to explain, but still made me wonder what the author is doing and I can kinda understand why this story has been targeted by censors in Australia, for example.
If you want to write me off as a prude or insensitive to Japanese culture, so be it. But I don't find watching a decent character getting sexually abused for the amusement of the protagonists endearing or amusing and the sibling love and sexualized prepubescent character are creepy. I've lived in Japan. A lot of people there think stuff like that is pretty weird and creepy, too.",5,Kerzic

                Imagine, if you will, a world in which two shut-in NEETs could save all of humanity by playing games. Take that premise, add some fantasty-esque elements like magic, possibly a little sister complex, and you’ve got No Game No Life’s take on the Isekai subgenre.
As expected of something produced under the banner of Madhouse, overall production quality is quite good. The soundtrack consists of a contemporary-sounding mix of electronica with some additional piano and percussion elements. The art style is very colorful, and the backgrounds and landscapes appear very dreamlike—fitting for the fantastical feel the crew was trying to create.
The whole series feels pretty fun,
                  which I guess we should hope for since it’s about games.
Our characters are fun and, for the most part, likable. That said, much of the show’s humor is sexual in nature, and there are some scenes that emphasize the sibling relationship in a pseudo-incestuous manner. Still, the animation, music, sound design, and story are enough to make No Game No Life a “good” series—qualifier being that you don’t hold a strong aversion to ecchi and/or incest type humor.",7,PrettiBoiSlim

                This is simply put, a pure blast of fun. It's mostly not serious, though it has some of that too. It's an anime to watch and enjoy without thinking too much. There's a little bit too much fan service for my taste, but other than that, it's a very nice anime to watch for relaxation. It's also a plus if you love video games and are not a very social person. Oh, and it has a very cool intro song, as well as unique battles. I recommend it to everyone who is looking for something not too serious and who wants  to laugh along

                Everything in this show is a wish-fulfillment fantasy that the audience it is marketed to can just insert themselves into, and feel very good about themselves, while being surrounded by cliched characters praising how ""smart"" and ""cool"" they are constantly. Nothing more than what would satisfy a horny 14-year-old boy at this point lol.
The fact that this is rated so highly and is so incredibly popular on this site tells you a lot about the demographics of this site. This low brow, cringe-inducing, ""turn your brain off and watch"" show is extremely popular, ranked over well-deserving media (stuff like Only Yesterday and Saraiya Goyou for
                  example), and that is a wee bit embarrassing. Seems very pseudo-intellectual show and comes across as incredibly unfunny, along with being bereft of any real emotional, artistic, or thematic weight.

                No Game No Life & No Game No Life: Zero
A show that made me feel the emotion.
Overview
No Game No Life is a relatively short 12-episode anime that has quite good reviews from the anime fans. Basically, the author transported the main heroes – 2 genius siblings: brother and sister to the world where everything is decided by the games:
•	No killing
•	No wars
•	“No cheating”
The rules are remarkably simple – if you can cheat but not get caught, then you are the victor. Main heroes abuse this algorithm as they come from less idealistic and dirtier world of ours. 
Core
At a first glance, the concept seems to be absurd that only kids and teenagers would consume to waste more time in their bedroom relating to the socially awkward but badass characters imagining that we are them and their glory is ours & jerking off on the waifus in this world.
However, the more you explore the world, the more you become accustomed with it and you cannot stop thinking of the endless possibilities on how “I would conquer the world instead of Shiro and Sora”, “what kind of game would I use to abuse the system and rise on top?”. 
The show works because it explains very simple games like rock/paper/scissors, coin toss and one of the main games in the world is chess – the world-wide famous game we all know and have a rough idea on what it is. And adds some twist to the game which makes it borderline impossible to win forcing the main characters to think out of the box and outsmart the opponents which in turn was brilliantly animated to give us eye-orgasms each time Shiro+Sora duel someone. 
Thus, Yuu Kamiya set up a simple-to-understand and extremely relatable world right from episode 1.
Stakes
It is important to mention that main characters are always bored unless they play or prepare to play. It is established in the first few minutes of the show that they NEVER LOSE as they dueled 1200 players with cheats in MMO RPG game in our world for 5 consecutive days while playing 2 accounts each and won. Thus, this boredom causes them to play with huge stakes. As we explore the world, the stakes become progressively more and more breath-taking. 
Even though, in real life betting all you’ve got to double the prize is a fool’s strategy – in this fictional world this is the core principle, if you are to win something of real value. You can’t help but feel the tension after the person bets his own life & they can become a slave, if they lose just one game of poker.
Consequently, the main characters are forced to be between a rock and a hard place all the time to achieve their mad goal of challenging the God of the world to a chess game. 
You bet all you got or you live a comfortable life – which will you choose?
Fanservice
For me personally, fanservice was not overboard but the creators definitely cut some corners both in anime and the movie: maybe it’s just me but drawing the boobs with no nipples looks unnatural. Of course, you can bring up the Attack on Titan argument – titans have no testicles, therefore it’s no different. BUT Shingeki No Kyojin has little to none fanservice and it is not one the building pillars for the show, unlike in NGNL.
Other than that, the show has the healthy combination between lolies and big boob waifus. The studio takes the best out of 2 girl types and shows it to the viewer without a feeling that the fanservice is being vomited on you.
The careful and precise use of fanservice showing the different fetishes can improve the show significantly which is what happened with NGNL. 
Fetishes that I mentioned upon rewatching both anime and movie: foot fetish (ep. 1), half-naked 18 y.o. girl with boobs (ep2-12), naked big boob girl (ep. 4), furry (ep8-12), big boob elf fetish (ep1), incest fetish (ep1-12), harem fetish (ep1-12), etc.
Conclusion
The clever usage of high stakes, simple plot, and gorgeous animation+fanservice makes wonders. The anime itself is an easy 8/10 overall rating but the movie added so much in terms of world-building, the history of the world creation and the explanation of what God is in that realm, and realization that the main characters knew all this just by their gut feeling makes it even more appealing.
For me, the anime+movie together is a 9.5/10 show that made me feel emotions I hardly ever feel.",9,KKChe

                Story
Isekai. That tells already a lot. But now it's not one nerd, but two siblings. That was new for me. The story and story telling is nothing too complicated and funny, perfect for enjoying. And that is the goal of this anime. Not too serious, but it fits. I wanted to know what will happen next, more than once was an unsuspected turn. And - the most important part - it is comprehensible. This story gets told intelligently and I love it. While other animes are fine with telling the viewers that this and that is a great move, this anime shows it. And not
                  just because they hid an important information - the solutions are often doable for the viewer, too. For me, that is a very valuable difference. So far, no ""gambling"" anime has done that better. The setting is good and made me curious. It's able to give the anime potential, even for the future. The movie proved that, btw.
Art
Outstanding. It fits perfect for a new, different world. It makes everything looking playful - good for a funny gambling anime. Sure it is a question of preferring. For me, it hits the eye. Very refreshing.
Sound
Really good. I enjoyed it very much, and I don't know if there can be a better alternative than the chosen music. Also, the voice actors were great as usual.
Character
Not very deep or complicated, but also not too casual. They fit to this setting. And after I watched the movie I know that the author can do it deeper and even better, but it's not the important thing for this anime. A fine decision for me. They are looking beautiful, and I am able to remember a lot of them, even after years. And this is a good sign for me. Noteworthy is the concept of a main character duo. Both do perform great, but only together they are unbeatable. I like that. So there might be some weak points, which is important. Else it wouldn't have been that exciting.
Enjoyment
Many points that made me enjoying this anime a lot are already told in ""Story"". I love the intelligent way this anime gets told, without being very complicated. It's funny but still exciting. Everything fits very well together. It's so sad that there is no second season in sight.

                Many people say that No Game No Life is overrated.
They may very well be right, as the amazing artwork may very well gloss over the story a bit too much. 
As someone who willingly admits having watched the first season 7 times, and am amongst the many anticipating the official release of the 2nd season, I personally really liked the story of No Game No Life.
Though the movie is at least twice as good as the main story, I find the bond and determination of the main characters inspiring and the heated execution of their strategies to be equally exciting with every watchthrough.
The comedic expressions,
                  whether it be fanservice or not (even if it is mostly fanservice), are fairly well executed. Though after hearing it over and over, they kind of lose their full effect. Their punch doesn't hit as hard, so to speak. Though that's usually a given with most any joke, yeah?
Backtracking to the art...
Even it may overgloss the anime, one cannot deny how amazingly beautiful the art style is. It is truly just pure ""eye candy"". 
Even after seeing it 7 times over, it still draws my eyes and keeps them glued to the screen. 
Moving on...
The theme of the story combined with where the main characters' viewpoint on things truly hit home for me. So forgive me if I let my sentiments influence my perspective. 
But I believe these two storypoints were well executed. 
In regards to these, I think it's better understood watching. I'm not sure how to explain it and if I tried, I wouldn't do it justice. 
Overall, my first rating of this anime hasn't changed. I still think this anime is very good. 
It's not a 10/10 but it's definitely above average. 
The drama, the comedy, and the beautiful fantasy all come together to form a beautiful image like pieces of a puzzle.",7,Koinaru
19815,"
                This was a pleasant surprise :-)
The art was distinct and beautiful, and they manage to not lose too much depth or clarity from using red outlines rather than black/grey. The soundtrack wasn't really memorable. 
The main attraction of NGNL is probably the story setting. It's complex- the possibilities for future seasons are endless. Yet simple enough to see how the story would move forward, without robbing viewers of their curiosity. Which is why!! I'm disappointed there seems to be no sign of a following season :-( The setting alone is promising, so it feels like wasted potential not to expand the franchise. 
I don't do
                  well with harem settings, suggestive incest, and meaningless H or moe. 
I can definitely see why reviewers with high expectations felt like the series wasted screen time on fan-service. I totally agree, and would've scored this above an 8 if it had been more focused on quest/game story arcs. The aspect of different girls from varying Exceeds (species/races) calling the MC master or transitioning so quickly from independent to subservient just REEKS of a pointless harem setting to please the 'main demographic' for this series. 
The only reason why I could score this an 8 was because I went in with no expectations, and watched it light heartedly. The setting was so engaging, so I could keep brushing off the fan service. This doesn't mean I can look past the fact they sacrificed a well-balanced and fast-paced story just for 5 of the same bath scenes sprinkled throughout 12 episodes.",8,nicolecries
19815,"
                I deeply regret that I paused watching this series for some time and ended up re-watching from the beginning. It kinda ruins the fun IMO. If only I weren't that picky in the past while trying to watch an anime without romance tag...  
Story;
A pair of NEETs with some serious mental performance was brought by ""god"" from another world just for the sake of watching them owning every game/challenges. From there, they challenged or were challenged by some opponents with variety of games with some serious bet and met a certain character which leads them to more high risk games involving country stuffs.
Its pretty
                  cool though since they show you the game rules, its loopholes and how they managed to overcome it and every time they explained how those pair of NEETs won, it gives you like a feeling of 'wow, these two are f*ckin' genius' and surely it made me wanting to watch more. Kinda addicted.
The story progresses pretty well, it shows those NEETs owning every single crazy challenges until to the level of ""ruling the country"" thingy. Some dirty jokes and fanservice to be expected with an ecchi tag, I don't think there any serious romance but only some little bits of incest lovey-dovey stuff. It doesn't overdone it or ruin the show IMO.
As a dumbass dude, sometimes I just can't understand the game rules or how it works, but for some reason every time they win, It'll just give me a feeling of satisfaction LOL. But don't worry, you'll at least get a rough idea after all while they're playing throughout the game.
Art:
I don't know if this is only me or the anime itself, but it has this overbright effect and personally I kinda disliked it. I watched the HD version of it on my laptop and I can't imagine watching it in lower resolutions. IDK man, probably my laptop screen is crap cause when I watch it on my mobile phone (it has an IPS display) it was way better.
Anyways, it looks colorful, character designs are okay combined with all of the background scenery stuffs.
Sound:
Those reverb kicks effects really gave the game scene show a lot more punch LOL. OP was okay, I liked the ED a lot more personally. I don't find anything wrong with the character voices so far... 
Character:
I think these pair of NEETs are way OP. Well I don't really like when the main character is losing so...
But yeah, those two were OP like, its really amazing how they could predict every single outcome and solutions to it and their explanation goes like  'we knew this and that so we did that and this which ends up you reacting to this and you lost, I won'.
As the story goes by, you'll be introduced to some powerful opponents too. The way it presents its opponents are pretty interesting. It shows that those opponents are quite skilled and will left you thinking, 'can those pair of NEETs really win???!!! I NEED TO KNOW!!!'. It isn't just some character where you know he's a bad guy after noticing some of his appearance or attitude. I really liked that presentation style. 
Enjoyment:
A 2014 anime. Wow. Really glad that I was finally able to finish this. Loved this series a lot. It managed to keep my ass on the seat and watch every episode till the end and still wanting to continue for more. Looking foward to watch its next sequel!
Overall:
This is a good series. Although I personally disliked the overbright effect, it didn't stop me from dropping this series. Just be sure watch on a proper screen! 
What to expect from this anime
- Bits of fanservice, dirty jokes (not much, tolerable)
- Pretty good comedy scenes after an intense battle moments 
- OP main characters. No worries till the ending!
- The way its opponent losing isn't that really depressing (Its a game world, have fun!)
- Kinda unpredictable sometimes
- Games and their rules, explained everything from A to Z, along with their loopholes. You get to see how the opponent counter attack sometimes.",9,mr57757

                Wow this show is very good. I'm not  sure how to explain  it but to the only way I can put it is that I binged watch this in one sitting without being  bored once. The animations, calculations, and characters are amazing. I love  that  they didn't introduce like 20 characters in a 12 episode series, instead we just had  a main 4 character thing going on. I really can not believe that  shit show didn't get a 2nd season like it's just mind boggling. It has a l ot of potential with the way the story is
                  set up and I think if they were to continue the show like it is right now, it could easily become a 50-60 episode show.
Anyways 8/10, I would've rated it a 9/10 but I personally don't like how they lewd the little sister that is only 11 years old, just feels creepy to me. Usually don't mind ecchi but come on man a kid?
I wouldn't watch this show if you're the type of person that needs complete closure from an anime because you won't get it.",8,aquasamaaa

                 Fanservice has always been relatively easy-ish for me to bear, and there are even animes in which I affirm that without it, it’d lose a lot of its essence. This is mainly due to how it’s implemented in the plot and if it really contributes something or not. Although in general I prefer that there is no fanservice at all, with this show this happened: If there are shows in which I can bear the fanservice, NGNL is the opposite; not only I didn't like it one bit, it’s one of the main reasons I didn’t enjoy the anime as much as I could
                  have.
- Story: 5/10
The plot isn’t necessarily bad, in fact in the first chapters I felt that it could become interesting (anyway I always tried to keep in mind that it wasn’t going to be adapted in the future so much more than these 12 chapters I wasn’t going to get). Something to distinguish about the plot is that it’s an Isekai that turns around several typical aspects of the genre, for example the fact that the protagonist isn’t weakened at the beginning but quite the opposite, although that’s an important problem that I had with this anime, and it's that no game really felt like a challenge, especially since the middle of the show. And while I understand that this may have been part of the purpose of the plot, I personally felt that the games were getting more and more boring. Finally, what makes it mediocre is basically its execution: I felt it with an unnecessarily slow pace, a comedy that made me laugh once or twice and with a use of very disgusting fanservice, unnecessarily sexualizing practically all female characters with no apparent purpose for the plot. In some animes I have been able to handle these things a lot more, but in this one for some reason it irritated me a lot. Parts that I liked about the story are for example the past of the previous king of the Imanity, the game of chess (because of how they managed it in an original way) and also the plot of Tet, the god of games
- Art / Animation: 8/10
Well, in this section I have nothing to complain about, the animation of NGNL is quite good, it was in part one of the reasons why I was able to continue watching. It’s quite unique due to its very varied and intense color palette, highlighting the red and violet colors that gave a feeling of being in a video game, strange as it may seem, plus this gave a lot of personality to the stage and the characters. If you are looking for great animation, you should definitely check out this show from Madhouse, they did a great job regarding that aspect.
- Sound: 6/10 
It was okay, I didn’t feel that it stands out either, so more than 6 I can’t give it, it just worked well enough that I don’t have much to complain about. Personally, I didn’t like the opening at all, although I did like the ending (obviously, like the totality of the review, although especially this last aspect, it’s quite subjective)
- Characters: 4/10 
This is the really bad point of NGNL, their characters are definitely some of the worst I've seen. Based on what has already been explained in the Story section, a character who stands out for being sexualized and only for that reason is Stephanie Dola, since although she counts as one of the co-protagonists, she has no other purpose than that. She functions as a comedy and fanservice target and that's it, it doesn’t serve any other remarkable role. Moving on to the protagonists, they're basically 2 extremely smart siblings who love to play video games: Sora, the 18-year-old older brother, and Shiro, the 11-year-old younger sister who apparently has a brother complex. The duo doesn’t work at any point of the plot because it becomes very predictable due to the basic premise of the anime that they never lose. I can understand that this may be entertaining for a lot of people but I found it irritating. The only character that didn't seem totally bad to me was Jibril, especially because of the drastic difference between her past and what she was doing now after the creation of the 10 commandments of the world, and she is the only character that made me laugh at least once(the wings scene was pretty good actually)
- Enjoyment and Overall: 4/10 
I don’t think I'll ever recommend this anime to anyone, unless I know the other person's tastes very well and know that they might like it. You should see it? Maybe, I can't recommend it as I already said but I can't say that no one should see it, it isn't totally disastrous and clearly it had enough success in the community to earn its spot (8.15 at the time of this review) and popularity. Regarding my experience, No Game No Life, although it had a few good moments that I partially enjoyed, most of the time I didn’t have a good time watching it, reaching a point that I only watched it for the animation and also because I try not to drop anything always that I can. Anyway I understand that No Game No Life was well received, it has games that can be interesting and entertaining, but that doesn’t mean that its execution is good, in fact it's very badly managed by the fanservice that a lot of the time overshadows all the good things that this anime could have had.",4,VaultBoy03

Sound(5):The sound in the anime itself as in sound effects are ok ,normal nothing that really gets you on the edge of your seat like some animes and the opening/ending soundtracks are forgettable at best.
Characters(5): I had kind
                  of an issue with the charaters,In the manga they had the same problem to me.The characters dont have anything special or to discover to them they are given a personality trait and they stick to it for the whole time for example : Annoying and whiny , Badass , hot (if thats even a personality) and it gets old also the main characters don't have anything except the fact that they are way too powerful and that they love each other.
Enjoyment(9): found myself binge watching it until the last episode idk if it was because I wanted to know if the story was getting anywhere.
Overall(8):It's easy and complicated (by that I mean theres allot of side elements to catch but its still enjoyable to casual listeners)I would reccomend this for the experience and a fun time.",8,sahlaeli

Plot
Two super-intelligent neet are transported to another world where everything comes down to games. You can't kill, assault, etc. The only thing that's allowed in that world is to play for what you want. There are 16 races that exist in the same world and compete to further govern the world.
Not that I hate the series, but if I have my problems against this one. Even if Here I'll just talk about the plot. First, it's the rhythm of the series. I mean, he's a couple of protagonists and his way of advancing the world. It's okay for them to arrive and prove that they're
                  capable of kicking some, but it feels like in this world it's settled for them. And this affects from the characters, their rhythm or their own games. For example, the same rule of The Whites  (Never Lose) can ruin the experience. It's the same as with One Punch Man, you know they're going to win, so you stop asking the question when and you start to wonder how.
This can get tiring, because the series feels like it's smart and that it always fools us. Like he's teasing us like his characters. But if you consider that they always win, you start to wonder how, you look for clues and pay attention to what happens, ending the magic of discovering the mystery. Something else in this regard. There are some moments that feel very forced, especially in the games, make the protagonists have everything done effortlessly. And this does not series bad, if only this told us something, once again as One Punch Man, that tells us about his world and how the purest heroism unfolds, but No game No life it just tells us that the protagonists are very bad and that they will always win, nothing more or nothing less. 
Art
I can't say that art is bad, but if at first you use it as an expressive medium, don't abandon it. The series separates the ""boring"" world is gray and dry, while the gaming world is full of light and colors. It also happens with Shiro or Sora, who almost lose their color when their being or motivation is lost.  But from now on, it all comes down to lights and colors that are sometimes saturated.
Sound
Sound plays an important role, but I can't say it's outstanding. Obviously in games and in important moments the music rises and gives power to the scenes. But when we talk about music in general, I can't say that it's much that gives the series.
Characters
Characters are what hurt me the most and I liked. The series has the potential to bring its characters to life, but is crushed by the series and its way of drawing our attention. Sora suffers the same disease as Kirito de SAO, is an emptycharacter,emptyenough to identify you with him,and set aside this super OP. You feel that you can be him, whocando what he does and that because he has something that you don't, in this case, his intelligence and ability, want to be like them. Without a doubt, it's a character that doesn't convince me and I know that it's built just to trick me and that it points to the series. 
Another example, Shiro, who wants to give him an importance in the series as the special girl, but only gives him an echii companion role of the protagonist, taking away everything special that supposedly has. The amazing character that  surprised me the most at first was Steph, who, although he is a clichédcharacter,but is the one who stays true the most to his own construction, there is as a spectator and companion of the protas. 
Like I said, a lot of potential but few applied. 
Enjoy
It's true that I've enjoyed the series and some games, but I still keep my point that the series uses a Deux ex machine in excess.By not showing me real watering, it does not give me much interest, let alone if they do not justify the Deux.",6,Watson20

                The series was somewhat alright. I enjoy the way that the storyline was structured, but for some reason I did not get a liking to the character of Sora. I'm not completely sure why, but to me he wasn't really a likeable character, unlike Shiro. She was adorable, and I liked how her character was represented. As for the storyline, it was quite good, especially with the fact that it did not only evolve around the two main characters. Instead every character got an even chance, to be presented, and show what they can do. The one thing that I really did love though, was
                  the art. The way that it presented both the characters, and their world was unique, and you don't see this art form as often. Unless i'm mistaken, but this was the first anime that I've seen that uses character design in this way.  Overall, if you enjoy a game themed anime, then you should give it a shot.",7,Akagi-han

                No Game No Life (2014)
For a long time, I wondered why people were so obsessed with this show not getting a renewal yet. I finally hit with prequel film and have watched that multiple times in what is a gorgeous film. I then ventured into this the main show it started from. I am so angry that I did not go to this sooner. This show is absolutely spectacular.
I love how the world is building around a set of rules that are enforced. Better understanding seen if you watch the prequel film first makes a huge amount of sense to why. It is great to
                  see how the world is bound by these rules to make it fun. I do love the main characters they are relatable. Instead of having protagonists that are suddenly thrown into a new world filled with confidence, it was perfect to see some who are not like that all the time. 
The main pair going through this world in a constant state of the game was great. I loved seeing the interactions of other characters. When the mains met the animal girl how they petted her and how she liked it was great again.
The show has a clear set of goals that they want to achieve and as you find out with point 10 of the rules of the world they actually understand how the world should be played. It is a great story that really is supposed to bring everyone together in as fun a way as possible.
Humans maintaining the weaknesses they have against mythical creatures and races is really well done too. We do not have a suddenly unheard of magical ability we are just as we are. 
The art of this show absolutely amazing. Vibrant colours creating a beautiful world. Character designs as well are done brilliantly. I would have loved to see some ex-Machina however in this one.
The OP and ED are great. General sounds are very well done. They take full use of the SFX available in the market. 
Characters are brilliant. 
Sora and Shiro our main characters are superb and the way they act makes for a great journey. They are no more cocky than they are scared of life itself. It is especially notable that Sora and Shiro actually almost immediately don't see this world as somewhere to escape from but to settle in. 
Flugel with their strong background as a living weapon also being perverted by the way of seeking knowledge. Also, those wings are brilliant. 
Humans still are shown as weak. Thankfully Sora can see how they can use that to their advantage. 
Werebeast race is all awesome too. I am glad like me the main characters could not resist but to pet and stroke the girls. Like Sora, the nation has the best girls you could ask for in that regard. Bring the catgirls!
Elves, as you would expect, are pretty cute. They are shown to actually enforce a type of slavery which was unexpected. 
Many other races exist and they are for you to experience yourself.
For me, my best girl is actually one people may not expect. 
Kurami or as properly known Chlammy Zell. Not only is her goal honourable if not a bit deluded it is a noble cause. She is also a super cute design and reminds me of my type. The way she acts out her scenes especially when she opens up is great. 
The show for me is a solid 10. It is great in every aspect and was a brilliant show. If I ever became rich and had the funding to do so I would have the entire series animated to ensure such a treasure was truly marvelled at.",10,robert788

                My first thoughts after watching it ""Sequel PLSS!!"".
    It started a bit weird, but it turned out very good.
The characters, their motivations and relations, the world, it's philisophy, you won't feel bored. I'm glad that the brother-sister relation is close, but not ""that close"". The sound and scenery are good and stylish, both fits this world perfectly.
   So you thought there isn't a wrong thing about it right? Well, let me tell you.
The speed of actions is a bit high, you can't really admire the world they got in it. It is a heroic story so you know the main
                  characters will win every time from the beginning. There are some characters they should focus on a bit more.
  Overall an entertaining series with some unexpected happenings and a lot of fun while it doesn't forget being serious. It's ecchi meter is not that high and far away from being meaningless.

                So No Game No Life, it has an interesting concept and was a isekai before this kind of anime were popular as now, but what I didn’t like was the execution as I felt the main characters were just a Gary stu and a Mary sue who could do anything they want without anyone stopping them, and it felt pretty boring as it felt that there couldn’t be any conflict, you could say that the anime is more about seeing how our protagonist are going to kick this character’s butt without effort and take some clothes off if there’s a chance because they are so
                  cool, as for the characters, they are just archetypes that you have seen on millions of animes before, you have: clumsy punching bag girl, quiet loli and cool otaku pervert, there are more characters but they are almost irrelevant, except for fox loli as she is a ""threat"", I would say that the only character that I liked was tet, but even him is not an actual character, and by that I mean that he almost has none participation in the anime as he is just the plot device to bring the characters on the game world.
I think that’s all I have to say, I recommend it if you like ecchi fan service and flashing colors moving on the screen, the artistic visuals are cool, it has style.",3,Neo_Sigma
19815,"
                First off, I'd like to state that this is the first review I've ever seriously written for an anime on MAL. Obviously it's purely subjective and I'll do my best to refrain from spoiling the series.
I first discovered this anime while browsing through Netflix's options of anime and like anyone else I'm sure, the art style was what initially caught my eye. It's unlike other typical anime's I've seen; it's flashy and bright. The characters' line art is in red instead of the usual black. Does it do anything for the story or the characters themselves? More for the characters than the story really, but
                  it sure is captivating and fun to watch all the colors pop.
The music itself wasn't all that interesting to me. There were a couple times throughout where they'd play background music that I thought was soothing and wanted to look them up, but nothing super captivating. I prefer the intro song to the outro and the song for the intro does a good job at capturing the upbeat vibes of the anime overall.
The premise itself seemed interesting enough. Two NEET siblings are pro-gamers who are completely bored with their normal lives, but upon being transported into this new realm where literally everything is decided by games, it's paradise for them. So you're left thinking, what kind of world is it? What sort of games do they play? It's just enough to wanna hook people into at least watching the first episode.
The characters... oh boy the characters, haha. Sora and Shiro are pretentious as heck. It was initially a huge turn-off for me and continued to be so throughout the series. They're supposed to be super geniuses, I get it. But to not have any character flaws to the point where they can outsmart opponents way before they've made a move--ah scratch that. They do have flaws, but the thing that I don't appreciate is that they turn their ""flaw"" into a... strength, when in actuality it's a toxic way of thinking. I'm referring to the siblings not being able to be without each other. They're basically codependent on each other but the story revolves around the whole theme of ""we aren't whole unless we're together"" motif. Maybe I'm just bothered by it because they're siblings and it's borderline incestuous. Come to think of it, yeah that was also another thing that irked me throughout this anime was having to watch Sora and Shiro be way too affectionate with each other.
The secondary characters provided more of a break for me than anything. Sora and Shiro are usually accompanied by their newfound friend, Stephanie who throughout is the butt of their jokes (which were mainly just hurtful jabs). There are plenty of times where the anime goes off and relies on the typical PG-13 inappropriate jokes and they use it as comic relief from the main story, but they weren't very heartwarming to me. Because to me, random moments of breast fondling and wanting anime chicks to take off their panties isn't exactly funny or amusing. But then again, maybe I'm the weirdo.
So you found a younger sibling who apparently is as smart as you, maybe even smarter, and that gave you life. So much so, to the point where you can't be without them but when you are, you can take on anyone. Maybe even the whole world. Sora and Shiro are so full of themselves, even during what are supposed to be heartwarming moments where you see their ""kind nature"" underneath all that cockiness, they just come off... horribly awkward to me.
I think this anime (like a lot of others out there) does a good job at romanticizing certain personality traits and concepts. You're a cocky bully but hey that's okay because you're supposedly helping everyone despite your pretentious attitude. For what it's worth, I'd still say this anime is worth a watch if you're into flashy art styles, if you're competitive yourself (I consider myself to be more of a casual gamer than anything), if you're into twists that are too convoluted you get lost trying to make sense of it, or if you're into borderline incestuous relationships.",7,Ethoteric

                Gotta say, that was an enjoyable show. I love the fact that it's sort of psychological, because of the games and the Blank making it so strategy based. Also, who couldn't love the opening, it's so legendary among the anime community.
Not much to say about this anime but - the story is pretty captivating, the main characters are lovable. The story isn't complex, but because of the nature of the MC's, its ""fight scenes"" are made into hardcore strategy-based games. My favorite characters of this anime are the Blank. Though the other characters are not-so lovable, they're still really well made.

                While the experiment that I mentioned back in the forums is going underway, I thought i'd review an anime I watched because I was interested in it.
So here's my review of No Game No Life.
Story:
TL;DR
NGNL is about two young neets going into a fantasy world to beat the god of gaming.
[Synopsis]-BEGINNING-
As for those who like a little more meat in a synopsis:
There are two worlds. Our normal world, and a fantasy world.
The fantasy world underwent a race wide war, including gods, leaving only 16 dominant races and 1 god. That 1 last god, who disliked how the races resort to killing each other to settle differences, decreed that all disagreements be settled in the manner of a game.
While being governed by 10 pledges, all races play all manners of games/contests in order to expand land, become royalty, etc. Basically it'd be like making Alexander the Great expand his empire through Old Maid or Chess with the rulers of his neighbors, wagering something of equal value to their lands.
Now back in our normal world, two siblings that go by [Blank] who excel so hard at gaming: they play MMOs with their hands and feet on two different computers each, are challenged by the 1 god I mentioned before to a game of online chess.
After the pair beat the god (the siblings not knowing it IS a god), the god is so pleased that he invites them to ""the world they should have been born in"". After a little understandable skepticism, you don't go accepting random offers on the internet, the siblings reflect on their neet lives and jump at the chance to play along with the god.
And thus the god pulls siblings into his world through their monitor, explains how his fantasy world works, and leaves the two siblings wanting to rule the other races, beat the 1 god again, and become gods themselves.
-END-
Erase all thoughts of SAO and .Hack, because this is not that. Not just because the god (called Tet) isn't a rogue game developer getting his kicks nor a rogue game AI being so gosh darn interested in perma-death; but because their isn't translating reality into game/fantasy world terms (see ""
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?"").
If anything, a similar anime is Outbreak Company due to a similar setting more than story, and The Devil is a Part-Timer for vice versa.
I don't have any real problems with the story. Nothing was rushed, everything was taken into consideration quite well. It's a nice ""battle of the wits"" anime with an ending that can go @#$% itself.
Make no mistake, sheep! This anime isn't here for your enjoyment. It's here to get you so invested, so head over heels, that you helplessly go buy the light novel and manga. Which is kind of backwards for me. I don't watch an animation, and become interested in the non-animated medium.
I'll get into a little more detail when it comes time to break down the characters.
Art:
Take your favorite anime's box art to an art program, and increase the hue and brightness. You like that? Well this anime has quite a bit of it. Dark and safe colors are the shackles of The Man, man.
""Who cares if every characters eyes look like they're about the jump out at you like your using a dim light to find your dog in a dark room, and the mouths seem to disappear off the face?""
These are sarcastic thoughts, but not a deal breaker.
The anime is very colorful and cute, with some surprises as it references other anime art styles. You ever thought the art style of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure was awkward but bad ass? NGNL thought so too.
*wink* *wink*
The animation for the most part is approaching fluid, even outside the action scenes. It has its hiccups, but only for the sticklers. Frames seem to drop at least once in all episodes, the only pine cone in the fruit salad being the opening portion of the first episode. So don't worry too much.
Sound:
For me, there's nothing like atmosphere. No matter what kind of anime you watch, you want all your senses to make you feel like your smack dab in the middle of everything.
I was able to get so invested into the anime, thanks to its stings, and the ost speaking to me. I may be a sap for good music, but I love how the anime is a house and the OST is basically the mortar to the brick. A melody that makes me believe as if this is both a virtual world and a fantasy world. Or a fantasy world looked at with the cold logic of a virtual world. Being exploited, and worked around.
I'm more of a fan of the opening than the ending theme, but both convey the atmosphere we should expect in the anime.
Character:
Here's the part I wanted to get to.
Our main characters are the siblings Sora and Shiro. Both are very intelligent in separate fields (with room for a grey area, that is both protagonists coming up with the same answers, I'll let you figure out where), the big brother is a mentalist and the little sister is a mathematician.
Together they're codependent neets, connected by the kidney to make an unbeatable duo at any game. Ever.
Nice. Strengths and weaknesses established, characters sympathetic, goals established, solid protagonists.
Now what may make you pack it in, is that the anime is centered around certain victory. The protagonists never lose, and thus never seem to change or learn anything new and thus never grow as human beings. It's a showcase of elites. But I invite the viewers to maybe be less focused on how they never change, and more so how they approach new problems. Treat them like Superman in how if we know he's always gonna bounce back, be interested in how he does it each time a trial comes around.
Only our protags aren't superhuman. In fact when boiled down anyone can be as special as them, so long as you pay attention to the world around you. Keep calm, gather data, use everything you can, don't start a game you haven't thought out.
Now this is where things might get hairy. The third main character (Dola Stephanie) is, to me, more of a supporting character. Someone to be worked around, rather than alongside. So naturally she's supposed to represent the audience. Not in how she conveys information to us in case the MAIN main characters say or do something that goes over our heads, but to represent you normal people who either play the straight man toward over the top antics or who are just happy to be here while having no clue what the heck's going on.
Us smarter, and more attractive people if I do say so myself, will see Dola representing other anime characters in other anime (right down to the massive breasts), rather than the audience. As they are often clueless, helpless, and try to compete with the smarter and more experienced lads only to show how much smarter and experienced those lads are. Someone their to really show what happens to normal people put in these situations. Much like how someone might say a well trained boxer can beat 10 normal men at once.
In terms of how bad-ass and useful they are on the screen, and who is left fooling the fools because the fools are laughing at the fool, Jibril should switch with Dola. But I believe Dola's main character position is more so because of her position rather than her abilities. It was because of Dola that they even knew Jibril existed, and it was because of Dola that the duo protags found a place to sleep and etc.
Now what makes me give this anime high marks character wise, are the interactions. There's still your ""bear taking a dump the woods"" ecchi scenes, and over exaggerated neet/otaku tendencies, but it's done in hilarious ways, I've never seen before. Gold star.
Enjoyment:
I had a grand ole time. Though the anime loses it's rewatch-ablity the same way you don't watch a mystery thriller once you know the answer to the mystery; the sheer antics, quotes to live by, and character interactions, trivia and art style are enough to keep me coming back.
There's nothing else like NGNL, and it's just damn good. Damn damn damn damn good.... damn.
Overall:
The final verdict of No Game No Life, is an 8 out of 10. A very high 8 that makes me feel like a man.
Other than that ""pissing in my corn flakes"" ending, I recommend you stream the anime at least once.
I don't recommend you buy it though, as my mother taught me to never pay for something that isn't finished, but it's your money.
""But what if you buy manga of an ongoing series?"" There's a difference between buying a complete volume with all the chapters inside, and buying a manga so you can subscribe for more chapters OF that volume.
For anime similar to it, that i've seen:
If you want to lean more toward setting and similar premise, watch Outbreak Company and Baka and Test.

                Firstly, let me say that No Game No Life is not a great anime, and it was never supposed to be. High-budget fun? Totally. But NGNL was never about delivering the pure creative quality of a Berserk, and it was never going to be as psycho-socially nuanced as something like 3-Gatsu.
But, Jesus, guys… The show is generally regarded by our community to be a 7 or 8, but personal enjoyment can factor in and bump that score up or down by a point or so. It’s just weird to see scores of 3, 4, and 10 because they’re such large deviations from the mean/median. Emotion
                  is important, but surely we’re better than letting emotion dictate our perceptions that strongly. Sigh.
Herein, I want to set aside talk of the setting and visuals; voice-acting; music; the requisite suspension of disbelief regarding the games; and the problems of unnecessary/morally problematic ecchi fanservice.
No Game No Life, for all of its glaring flaws, still has a lot to offer.
Take philosophy, for instance. NGNL, in line with Nier: Automata, speaks to a lot of humanist ideas.
“We are the noble weak.”
-As Sora said, there's something about the struggles and the lack of easy ways out that makes humanity pretty great. Even though you have it easier doesn't mean you have it better.
-Physical stats, magical power, longevity… All important, but what matters most is who you are and how you live your life.
-Indeed, as Imanity contends against (and eventually with) the higher orders of Exceed, it makes you think about how we in our world stratify ourselves.
-Though, for all of its focus on humanity, the show doesn’t devolve into anthropocentrism. Again, less relevant things like species or race fall away, and what you have left is one's own character and the pervasive sense that, though we don't necessarily have to all be friends, we can at least co-exist. This is encapsulated by the last of the Pledges.
“10. Let’s all have fun and play together!”
-Beyond co-existence, Kuuhaku’s goal isn’t to conquer the world. As far as I can see, they just want to have fun. And if they happen to do some good along the way, then all the better.
-Suffice to say, I’m a big fan of living life this way.
Lastly, I want to talk about Tet, the god of games and Sora and Shiro’s sponsor.
-I love Tet. I love the idea of God or a god as being playful, as having a sense of humor. In contrast to how most deities are depicted…
-Tet is generally hands off, but when they do make a move, it’s pretty significant (like when they appeared out of nowhere to claim the Suniaster on behalf of Riku).
-Food for thought: how does Tet compare to other deities like Truth from FMA or D from Kumo Desu ga?
Anyways, I have a lot more I could talk about, but I’m tired. If you made it this far, thanks for hearing me out! I know there's a lot to be said about NGNL, but I hope I've left you with some thoughts to chew on.",9,Camus482

                Even though I don't view NGNL as a Ecchi, because MAL says it's an Ecchi I'll be using my ecchi category rating so it won't be rated as a "" normal anime"", but I will use it on 50% power, because in my opinion NGNL isn't an Ecchi. Keep that in mind.
I will be rating ANIME so I won't be comparing how well it represent LN or manga.
\\ spoiler alert just in case //
Art: 8/10
NGNL takes place in fantasy world full of bright and colourful pattern. We see fantasy races like humans, elves etc. and it has really nice feel.
Characters: 7/10
Our MCs are Sora and
                  Shiro, they are teenage gamers, who are masters at any game. When S&S arrive to fantasy world they decide to conquer all races that represent chess piece and challenge god at the game of chess. NGNL has a lot of characters with different personalities, but I didn't find our MC duo much appealing, they overcome some trials and challenges, but overall I was dissapointed in their development and it reminded me of SAO character development a bit.
Character development: 6/10
Not much really, our characters are befriending, but not much afterwards, our main duo stays pretty much constant through the series there is shown some flashbacks from their past, so I'll give credit for that, but overall our characters doesn't really change.
Story: 6/10
OP characters combined with cliche, but synopsis first. S&S are invited to fantasy world, where you settle everything through games. There are a lots of different races, which are represented by chess pieces and humans are considered one of the weakest, because they can't use magic. Our duo decide to conquer all the races and challenge the god. Through the season our characters meet and compete with different races and finding new allies. Now to the OP and cliche, our characters doesn't lose, which isn't really that big of a problem, what is problem are cliche of type ""won in the last second"" or ""almost lost, but won"", these appears quite a lot and it gets annoying, I would like to see them win without problems or lose sometime, because every single fight is with problems, which they always somehow solve.
Story progression: 7/10
NGNL is main story only, so it is linear. Season goes pretty well and it gives somewhat enough content to keep you entertained.
Since Zell Chlammy was aiming to become queen and not doing anything that would put her in villain category, I won't include villains.
Sound: 7/10
NGNL has 2 openings and 1 ending. I found them to be not very memorable, but that doesn't mean they're bad, they are pretty good, but I think as you will go through many anime series you will probably forget those.
So overall rating of No Game No Life is 6,83/10 that means 6/10. I noticed that NGNL is quite similar to SAO in some aspects, so if you watched SAO you can somewhat use it as a comparision or the other way if you are considering watching.",6,PeterFromRussia
19815,"
                I really had high expectations for this show, and while I enjoyed it in certain areas, it really didn't live up to the hopes I had.  This is probably more a result of me blindly listening to so many other people raving about the show than anything else.  I really do believe this show had potential, at least until it completely devolved into another fan service/sibling squish fest.  
Story: 5/10 
Look, I generally love the Isekai genre, and I'm thrilled that we are experiencing an Isekai boom at the moment.  With that being said, I like to be taken to worlds
                  where the overall problem can't be so easily solved.  It's basically foreshadowed whether or not ""Blank"" will ever lose or not at multiple points.  Sora and Shiro are so overwhelmingly good at all games because they are geniuses, that the only sorts of drama they have in this show are minor setbacks during the elaborate games they play, but then it turns out that it was all in their plan all along and the outcome was never in question.  Really??  The plot of the story is existent, since there is an end goal, but the vehicle sputters along trying to get there.  Filled with excessive amounts of jiggle and multiple bath scenes, there is almost more waste than actual advancement of plot.

The colors are visually stunning.  There is an abundance of pink, and often times it is set against darker colors, creating a very unique contrast.  I wish I had watch this on a computer and not my phone to be honest, so I could have seen the show on a larger scale to take in more of the beauty.  The world is beautifully crafted, with large chess piece-like mountains in the backdrop.  
Character: 5/10
My favorite character was Stephanie Dola.  The rest of the characters did nothing for me.  Ms. Dola played a comedic relief role, but did a wonderful job.  She was stupid, buoyant, cute and above all else, her voice acting was entertaining and passionate.  Sora was the annoying neet brother who dotes on his sister in a perverted way.  In several scenes, he looks like a Lelouch Lamperouge knock off, which grinded my gears a bit.  Shiro was your typical cute little sister, complete with mono-toned shut-in personality.  I liked that she was a genius, but would have appreciated her having a larger role in playing some of the games.  It was almost like her character wasn't needed and the show had to force her into the games at moments.
Enjoyment: 6/10
I'd say I enjoyed this anime, but that is the extent of it.  Being transported to another world and seeing some of the psychological games there were being played was entertaining enough, but I don't understand how this anime was rated as high as it was now that I've seen it. 
Overall: 6/10
Overall, this anime was just about mediocre, in my opinion.  The art stood out to me, but the rest just fell flat.  It had potential until the usual suspect of excessive fan service showed up.  The show had it's funny points, a couple of dramatic moments, and good voice acting, but nothing more. I was curious how this anime would end given that the story seemed to be moving slowly considering what the end goal was for Sora and Shiro.  I can say that I didn't care too much to learn that there is no season 2 in the works.  That might be a bigger indicator for the overall quality of this show more than anything else.",6,Railgun82

                REVIEW WITH NO SPOILERS
No Game No Life it's a blockbuster and we can't evitate the fact that most of the public loved it. And this anime, at my vision, was really simple.
Two Brothers stuck in a world which is controlled by games. Not too much original, but it's very funny and I enjoyed a lot for the fact that the anime it's not too much ambitious.
The comedy really Works with the peculiar and colored animation (which did not bored me at all). There are some stupid moments, but it is still really cool.
So the anime reached all its potencial, besides showed its universe very well.
If
                  you like logical games and a very funny anime, with the extreme colored animation as a bonus, this is your anime!!",8,JohnPerez

One day they get a weird email challenging them to a game of chess of Shiro uses her immense intelligence to win the game they get asked if they want to go to a world where games are used to settle everything. 
Sensing that this would be their perfect world they accept in the world they are sent to humans are the weakest of the 16 species and are reduced to a small part of the world. Can Sora and Shiro

Art 7/10
Decent art for the most part with some good fan service but also looks a bit average in places.
Sound 7/10
Sound and music are reasonable but nothing special fairly good voice acting with some good humour.
Characters 8/10
Nice cast with most characters adding humour to the story, Sora and Shiro are also characters that are more complex and intelligent than they may appear at first and this comes across more and more as the series goes on.

                I feel like I just came off an acid trip. I really have no idea what I just watched, but I know I enjoyed it... I think.
Okay, well... art. Let's just start there and see where this goes. It's different. I think I like it, but it's weird. It's a lot of color. Not necessarily bad color; in fact, it looks really nice, it's just a lot. The music didn't blow me away, but at the same time it felt epic depending on the situation.
The story was pretty straightforward. I enjoyed the overall premise a lot more than I was expecting, and the dynamics or
                  ""world rules"" or whatever you wanna call them were extremely well written and interesting. That being said, it was just a little bit all over the place. I can't really tell if the pacing was too fast or if the events that were happening just weren't written to feel as grand as they should've been or both, but by the end of watching this, it felt like a bunch had happened without it actually *feeling* like it had. Super vague, I understand, but that's the best way I can explain it. 
However, the highlight of this anime was the characters. Well, to me, the main character himself. His intelligence was showcased very well in combination with the writing, and his motivations and drive are probably the things that kept me the most interested throughout this whole experience. There was nothing by way of character development, but rather, it felt like we were seeing why that character as he was, was already extremely powerful.
So, I mean, the games were fun to watch because of all the twists and turns as well as the grand scale it was all on, but the explanations for some of it felt kind of loose. The main character kept me captivated, but he didn't change at all during the course of the anime. The story made me feel like something epic was on the horizon, but it also felt uneventful at the same time. A mixed bag, this anime. That being said, I do find myself wanting to know how it all ends up. Do with that what you will, but it's an easy watch, so enjoy it as much as you can.",7,BabyGirl06301

                it's pretty interesting anime and moreover, it's the first anime to include advanced math formulas in game analysis. in the time of AlphaZero and world-class DOTA and Starcraft AIs, it's definitely offers a better view into game-playing in this time. people should be more aware of what gaming can do to this generation's learning and surviving (so it's interesting in that aspect...? well i did not say that...) cause a lot of learning is self-motivated and the best grandmasters are almost always insanely interested in their own domains (Erdos, many chess and go masters).

*NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW*
No game no life is a genius anime. The main protagonists of this show is Sora, a teenaged kid and his pre teen sister, Shiro. They were game experts, and all they did was play games, because they hated real life and called it a 'shitty game'. Then, a god from another world brought the siblings into his own world. All the conflicts in the world were settled through games... blah blah blah. And so on. Just read the synopsis. I thought the story was interesting and some of the battle
                  strategies Sora and Shiro planned out was absolutely GENIUS.
The art in this anime is, well, really colorful. Other people say it hurts their eyes, but I didn't have any problems with that.
I didn't notice anything beautiful with the the sound, I just thought the opening theme was amazing.
I really enjoyed this show. The only thing I had problems with was the fanservice. The comedy wasn't that great either, but since the main focus of this anime wasn't comedy, that's okay.
Overall, I would give this anime a 9/10. I liked it a lot, though I admit I cringed a little at the excessive amount of fanservice and bad comedy.

                I really enjoyed 'No game no life' and I think that it definitely deserves the rating and popularity that it has received. I like the dynamic between the two MC's that when put together they are unbeatable as a team.
I thought that the corner-stone for this anime was it's comedy. No game no life is probably the funniest anime I have seen thus far in my career of watching anime. The way the characters interact together and some of the lines were just so unexpected I found myself uncontrollably laughing out loud which is a first from anime!
I wish there was more games and development
                  of the plot throughout the first season. In total they played about 4 games which I thought wasn't enough but it was tolerable since they instead filled their time with jokes which I enjoyed.

                The escapist genre is nothing new, but how they mix it makes it unique in my book. Again, world domination is nothing new, but having fun is another fresh take on things. And that is what this anime tries and succeeds to be in its core. Fun and very much loving. 
The story is straightforward and doesn't try to convolute itself, thank the heavens. There are many facepalm and vexing moments, but none of them have I found cringy or irritating. The art is pretty to look at and very vibrant. Never have I thought that an anime could pull off so many different shades.
                  
The characters fairly simple as are their motivations, but for such a story it is necessary. My point is that this anime knows what it wants to be and does it splendidly.
If you want an enjoyable and loving comedy with fantasy elements, along with a healthy dose of ecchiness, then this is the anime for you.",8,IllogicalSquid

                So I thought that this anime was AMAZING. The whole concept of the story was very cool and unique. The idea of being placed into a gaming world sounds amazing to me. Also I loved seeing all the funny references made throughout the anime to certain games and anime.
Story
So I believe that the storyline was great as I mentioned. I thought that it was a great concept to be sent into a world where all quarrels are solved by games and that these two protagonists are trying to conquer this world so they can be set free.
Art
Now I absolutely loved the style of art in
                  this anime. I think that the artist did a great job at finding the perfect art style for this anime.
Sound

                my review of the anime
Story - 2 characters are summoned into a world where it is their field of expertise, games. Everything is decided by the games, so it is natural that they are the only ones in charge.
the ways I see the anime :
An anime where the main characters are not pussies and actually own them OR
A colorful anime with an excess of fanservice"" (although there isn't much ecchi compared to modern ecchi anime) OR
""Observe the here and now. Watch the characters rise from the lowest to the highest.''
The art stands out so well it's crazy. The bright, insane colors may put some people
                  off, but it really grows on you and is beautiful.
Sound - The sound I thought was really good, it fits the character lines and also the music is perfect.
Characters - You have a big brother and his cute little character. They come up with ""blank"" which is basically their player name. After learning most of the world, it was decided that they would help their race rise to the top. As the story progresses, they obtain strong allies and continue to rule.
Fun - Now this may be repetitive, but there are many epic scenes backed by the great OST where the main characters just dominate.
Bad things I found about the anime :
The anime is not over yet. If there was a second season, this would be one of the best anime out there. 
The main characters are also very powerful. They never seem to lose and as soon as you think someone has wronged them, they fight back.
this anime is perfect

                No Game No Life I see as falling either into the love it or hate it category that comes down to how much degenerate content you can take. Pretty much every episode will have girls wrestling with hoses or someone getting clothing removed. But past that is some real good content.
The two main characters are an incredibly interesting dynamic, acting as a team that supports the others weaknesses while also being unable to function without each other. Steph also acts as a main character, spurring most of the action and explanations but also acts as the comedic relief and at times some nice emotional moments
                  that breaks up the go,go,go pace of the show.
The world and its premise are an interesting setting, especially when you find humans are at the bottom of the pack. The question becomes, ""How will Blank outmaneuver and best the other races?"" Sometimes this becomes a little much and doesn't make much sense but the spectacle is still there.
All in all, No Game No Life is a good time with really upbeat color pallet and interesting characters. If there was one thing that could have been done a bit better is perhaps the explanations of how Blank overcomes and outmaneuvers their challengers as some just seem arbitrary and others begin to fall apart under scrutiny. That being said, it doesn't stop the show from being a really good time/watch.",8,serpentine19

                Ah, we gamin' in another world. It's hard to stand out as an Isekai, but this does. Unlike Konosuba or Mushoku Tensei, the trash/scum from another world uses shut-in superpowers to dominate a high-fantasy MMO universe theme is too tame for NGNL. That's just the starting point for our brother sister duo in our world, before they get isekai'd. As gosu gamer gods who never lose a game and are known as blank, because they alway leave their name blank in games I guess, their reputation preceeds them and prompts an omnipotent literal god from another world to challenge them to a game of chess
                  and lose somehow. The loss prompts this god to invite them to his world, where all disputes are settled by games - 10 rules known as the pledges dictate the rules of gamer engagement. The pledges are known to all inhabitants, and are as binding upon the fabric of reality as the laws of physics - you can essentially magic things in and out of existence just by setting terms in a game agreed to by both parties. This mechanic is abused heavily.
Sounds kinda dumb right? Yeah, it is. Towards the end I will be surprised if you're not experience ""big brain play!"" fatigue as it just gets more incredulous. BUT - the world is a creative overload where all out faction warfare between different varieties of omnipotent beings (and humans getting rekt in the crossfire) started pissing god off a little, so he forced some sense of peace upon these warring factions with the 10 commandments of gaming. Selection of these two main characters for an isekai ticket, given their skill at disecting and exploiting video games and games in general, is thus a far easier pill to swallow than ""I was a useless nobody but truck-kun and goddess-chan showed me how 2 git gud kekw"". Though bizarre, there is some consistency to the why of NGNL - the motivation of our protagonists is simply to game, bro. And they deliver absurd, comical, entertaining, at times even bewildering strategies to overcome opponents in games like ""materialization word chain"" - and thankfully the art direction and animation are up to the task of making this work. 
What about the fanservice? Well, they lean so hard into the fan service it actually doesn't seem like fanservice anymore - it's a bit like Konosuba, just so cheesball that it's hard to resent it. To an extent it is self-aware and a self-parody, but one thing to like about it is the sexy pet angel that is defeated and thus absorbed into the team in probably my favority game of the show, ""materialization word chain"". She's completely comfortable with lewd topics and cracks some excellent creeper lines, trading inappropriate comments with wild abandon without becoming an annoying meme like Darkness did. They don't keep the quality of her lines quite up to where it was at first, but it's appreicated. I doubt they could have managed such a high-brow fanservice character, but for the spectacular english voice actress who really brings that character to life in such a fun way.
The art direction and animation of NGNL is really good. A bit of a surprise - but particularly the colors, filters, and chosen setting of the various battles being so varied and ""hype"" for the given conflict give the world of NGNL an impactful and memorable feel. From the first shot of lil sis' playing two characters by gripping a mouse with each of her feet, to one of the final shots with this intense cosmic ray of light beaming away from the planet to call upon the most powerful faction and communicate with them - materialization word chain which I've already mentioned - and the video game they find themselves playing with all of humanity put on the line as collateral... it's quite a trip. There's so much to like about how they've drawn this, which I imagine the source material should be credited for but you also will not be disappointed in the overall spectacle. That said, the quality is inconsistent at times and some sequences received far more attention than others. There are swaths of the runtime that feel incomplete compared to the better bits.
It's a fun show, but it's a dumb dumb dumb show. The few attempts that are made, at least in the dub version, to connect to deeper themes all fail miserably and leave an ""ew, can we get back to the show please?"" aftertaste. Examples are ""see? You're one of us - you're a GAMER"", some power of friendship/believe in yourself stuff, and inappropriate gracious-in-defeat and on-our-side-now moments that were bad enough to feel jarring even in the context of this absurdist take on the genre. To be fair, this may or may not be present in the subbed version or source material. I refer to the dub, which sounded like it took some license.
Overall it's a watch - the first episode tries hard to show that there will be quirky fun stuff and good animation ahead even if this seems a bit weird right now, and I appreciate that. You should have a feel for whether you can swallow the icky stuff and keep this one down after the first episode, and I always prefer that to a show that doesn't even try to hook me or gets me hooked on something it won't be able to deliver. 
NGNL is a visual treat set in an engrossing and exceptionally silly universe with a good dub and a few stand out english voice actors/actresses. Don't take it too seriously and you'll be entertained.",8,PiereDelecto
19815,"
                Many anime may be entertaining, but few are stunning. To name some -- Death Note; Shingeki no Kyojin; Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works.
No Game No Life (NGNL) joins that tier.
With its extremely colorful animation, it grabs you from the first episode. I recognize that animation may play a large part in how you evaluate a show, but I wasn't all that wowed by that of NGNL as I was for Shingeki no Kyojin. To be honest, the gaudy reds and pinks and magentas were a bit flashy, and I didn't appreciate the superfluous ecchi aspect, especially when regarding Shiro. I know that some strange people
                  out there like lolicon, but I sure don't, and I'm sure the majority of sane anime viewers don't either. (Now I know that the anime industry targets specific audiences, so it's sorta fine, but still.)
But what REALLY amazed me was the game aspect. Whoever designed the premise of NGNL, came up with all of the games, had the genius to plan ahead of time how Sora and Shiro win all their games -- I applaud you. Kudos. High praise. Like, these siblings take genius to the next level. Light and L, yeah, you were pretty smart, but compared to you Sora and Shiro are like Socrates to a mere yeoman. Each successive game they play in this world of games becomes increasingly complex, and to respond, the Blank only plans ahead even further.
I'll say it again. Sora and Shiro are GENIUSES. What's more, their relationship is very touching. (Don't worry it's not romantic at all.) Each by himself/herself, Sora/Shiro is very good, but not invincible. But together... it's only too understandable, being former NEETs who played games all day and night, having only each other for social company... THEY ARE UNDEFEATED. Unstoppable. Indomitable. Whatever words that can be used to describe such skill, use them. They're like LeBron James, driving down the court right through his defenders.
NGNL is one of those anime whose plot/premise is so good that even if the animation, characters, and soundtrack were all trash, it would still be highly entertaining. But its animation is... great, its soundtrack brilliant, its characters shallow and catering to strange people but okay. You even learn a bit about game strategy. Ergo, I give No Game No Life the highest recommendation.

The plot and worldbuilding isn't bad.

The art style is very unique and aesthetically appealing, although people are mixed on the overuse of purple. The character designs are quite unique, especially Shiro's and Jibril's.

My biggest gripe is they haven't made a second season, but there are rumors it's a work in process so who knows. The characters are somewhat unique, being two halves to a single unbeatable player, but are in line with the protagonist that is impossibly intelligent. On-par with Lelouch or Light Yagami but in a fantasy world. I enjoy how they solve some of the challenges and realize the ultimate nature of the game.

                No Game No Life lets me think back to SAO as it is in a way very similar to that Anime series but in the same sentence its also very different and unique. The series name No Game No Life fits in perfectly with the series and in some ways it makes perfect sense.
Story:
The story line for No Game No Life is really well done as its takes the viewers on a fantasy filled ride from start to finish. The 2 main characters is what makes this series stand out to me as there aren't to many anime series with 2 main characters that are
                  seen on equel footing/ground and they complement each other really well as they should be considering they are brother and sister. The story line also makes a lot of sense and it doesn't confuse the viewer in any way whatsoever. So im scoring the story a 10/10.
Art
The Art, scenery and characters are really well done, colours are really vibrant and colourful so for this fact alone I am scoring the Art a 10/10.
Sound
As with the Art the sound is also perfectly done as it compliments the series well. Battle music fits in perfectly at times and the character voices are crisp and clear so I am scoring it also a 10/10.
Characters
As I already mentioned the 2 main characters is what makes No Game No Life an amazing anime series. There carefree attitude, personality and street smarts is what sets them apart from the rest of the characters in the series. For some characters character development can be improved upon but I am scoring this a 10/10.
Enjoyment
I am not going to say a lot on this as I really enjoyed every episode in the series and it was fun to watch so. The battles in No Game No Life are fantastic to watch since the main characters fight not with superpowers or anything like that but they fight using there brain so I am scoring it a 10/10.
Overall.
This is a really fun anime to watch since it is so similar to SAO but also unique in its own right. I cant wait when a season 2 gets rolled out so I hope this will happen soon. This particular series might not be for everyone but I think fans of SAO and similar genres will find this series fun to watch. Scoring No Game No Life a 10/10.",10,Wouts33

                This anime is very well thought out. To create this kind of plot, it requires lots of backwards planning and considerations regarding the details starting from the very first episode. What is seen in an earlier episode can reappear 3 episodes later. The way that it comes together makes it evident that lots of thought has gone into this anime. The art is amazing if I do say so myself, and is one of the best ""underdog"" animes I've seen. The only thing I did not like is the brother-sister complex.

A mediocre isekai anime where the opponents use besides magic, their minds and try to challenge the world itself where they are summoned to. 
Well, I'm not really impressed about this anime. I thought it would have something peculiar about it. But somehow is an anime that can be watched.
Art is a little bother. Mediocre and even sub-par. They tried to use colors to give the vibe of a virtual reality or something like that. I found it pretty distasteful. 
Sound was good.  Not something really interesting. But it had synth. Synth gives it a 10. That

But hear me out to at least know why i like it, and if you are not the complete opposite of the genres, you should check it out. 
About the story:
Now my first and to this date favourite anime is Madoka magica. So you
                  can surely understand, that No game no lifes plot didn't threw me off. Just some siblings trying to defeat god.  But what still makes it a 9/10 is the fact that they are trying to overthrow god. When i watched this anime, I cried. Sure, I am not Sora, but some minor girl, and i am defineltly not shiro, but I have not agreed and understood more the morals of an anime more than this. Ignore the ecchi, its not that hard. I love the way it explains things, scorns the current moral of society, and points out all the flaws by making simple examples. Now, even if I agree with all these things, it took me more than a whole year to figure them out completly, so it does have somehing with madoka magica in commom: The lots of thinking. So, no, it's actually not something for shounen fans, who just want to enjoy a beautiful plot with great fight scenes and a bittersweet ending. I mean, the characters litteraly say, that they are not the protagonists of some shounen manga. They put deep moral into stupid things, which kinds ruins the whole moral, but learning while having fun? For sure. there is a reason why they are NEETs. the reason being, they have seen the irony of this world, the fact, that humanity could do so much more, if their own stupidity wouldn't stop them.  I also recommend the light novel, there everything is explained so much better! So yeah, if you want to get it fully, read rather the light novel. Now I understand the fact, that most people don't like this show because of the incest. But somehow, they are okay with konosuba and all the other shows, It's ignorable, really. Everything is played off as a joke, don't waist your time, focussing on that. Even fairy tail is worse, with all of their bath scenes and Wendy. So, yeah, ignore the incest, look at the moral, and enjoy the plot. It's like comedy, but with flavour. Not saying that comedy does not have flavour, but a more mature flavour.
Characterdesign:
Threw me off completly. It's beautiful. The only thing that matches that is Land of the lustrous. Colours, many beautiful aspects, and a whole lotta details. ""Just like a true fantasy world"". 
Sound:
Also outstanding. Its wonderful. really hyping up, fitting to the animes plot. i mean, just look at sora's speech, and you know he is serious. 
Charcater:
Now that is interesting. About the character there is not much to say, except that they are flat. Sora, disappointed NEET, trying to be a genius. Shiro, disappointed NEET is a genius. their charactzer is REALLY flat. I would say it's in the middle between Kirito and Phosphophillyte.  Not flat, that the show isn't enjoyable, but stillm pretty boring. Reason? To make them relateable. We are all actually super flat too. Not some lofty heroes, ""I sacrifice myself for the sake of the world"" guys. They are extra made extremly egoistic and arrogant to mirror us. If someone would hand us a mission to save some country, we would run away. So would they. They aren't heroes. they are egoistic assholes. So are we.
Enjoyment:
The lightnovel is more enjoyable tha the anime. But still, overall i actually said everything about the enjoyment. So.. have fun.
P.S.: Watch No game no life zero for some really lofty heroes. That one is really a special gem for everyone. Shounen fans, romance fans, that movie is amazing.",10,ellie625163

                Nice mix of comedy and strategy. The direction makes every move made in the games feel big brain, kinda like death note and code geass. 
The show doesn't care about being gloomy or serious, instead it blasts you with awesome moments and just does its thing. Sora and Shiro are highly entertaining to watch. Unbeatable as they may be, the point isn't to make them relatable but to have this powerhouse of a duo that takes on any and every high stakes challenge they come across. The audience may then enjoy these ridiculously over the top moments to the fullest. 
I love the colour palette
                  of this show, the designs aren't the most interesting but the visual direction makes up for it. The music is awesome: very gaming inspired and has a some very funny references. 
I don't enjoy the incest :P 
9/10 can't recommend to just about anyone because of the detail I just mentioned but for anyone who's willing to look beyond the weird fetishization this show is an absolute blast!",9,Soul_too

                I'm late writing a review on this, as at the time I left review writing to other people,
But No Game No Life is one of my favourite anime, that hasn't changed from when I first watched it, up to present day.
It is visually exciting, really well animated, and has that colour overload, it helps sell you on the concept that you are in a true fantasy world. It has an otherworldly look to it.
Most Isekai have this standard look, it's a 'fantasy world' that is based on the idea of how the medieval era looked.
The action is fluid and visually stunning. This whole anime is
                  a feast for the eyes.
The sound is great, not only the OST but the audio ques helps put you in a moment to either give dramatic tension, or let you know that things aren't right, and the original voice acting in the sub really lifts the quality too as there are so many character driven moments, that the voice acting has to sell the scene.
The story and characters are well written and well developed,
With the characters we get to understand them, their strengths, their weaknesses, how they think, the strategies they employ for the games, 
For example, the often dismissed and ignored character Steph is often just thought of as an idiot, comic relief and fanservice.
However Steph is much more than that. Steph is quite smart, and she's a good ruler, she understands politics, and what it means to run a country. Steph just isn't a good gamer, and a lot of that comes from her 'weakness' in that she is too trusting, and has a lot of faith in people. She isn't as cynical, she's not as underhanded and doesn't engage in trickery, she's rather innocent and naïve, she's an open book, which means she's easily defeated in games.
That is why she's treated as an idiot,
However she's determined to learn, to improve, to understand why she keeps getting defeated, and to become a better gamer, and the fact that Sora and Shiro keep her around is a sign of how much they respect that.
The series is well written, engaging, funny, frantic, and you find yourself watching one episode after another until you've finished the entire series.
The outcome of the games may be decided from before the very start, but the entertainment is in watching how the games play out.",10,mrfried
19815,"
                Honestly I only love this anime for 2 things art and Shiro.
Why?
The art is outstanding and beautiful and as for Shiro well she's just relatable that's all (plus in I love the color scheme of her hair in fanart and statues).
Don't get me wrong though their are more relatable things about this anime besides Shiro especially if you play games yourself but Shiro is the number 1 thing that I related to.
As for the story itself, its decant enough to where I gave it a 6 rating. I will give it credit though cause I've never seen an anime before this where the anime was
                  about games. I'm used to the 'save the world' type of animes.
However I do recommend this anime if you just want to watch something relatable and for pretty scenery.",10,pixeldustXX

                ***THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW***
Boy what a ride. After twelve episodes of eyegasmic epicness, the first (of hopefully many) season of No Game No Life has concluded.
Story: 8.5/10
So the basic premise of No Game No Life is the following of Shiro and Sora as they try to make their mark in a whole new fantasy land that is ruled by games; not wars. Throughout the show you began to understand how in control (IE: badass) they are when it comes to pretty much anything game oriented. What I liked most about the story though was the pacing. From my perspective, there really was no
                  filler or fluff in this season. Every episode had a clear and defining purpose. Yes there were a lot of ecchi scenes that might not have been needed but news alert; it's an ecchi anime. Keep in mind though this is an adventure anime and what that means is that there is a single goal that the main characters want to achieve and in the process of achieving that goal there is a fundamental progression taking place. What I am trying to get at is that this anime excels brilliantly at providing something new in each episode and makes you cringe waiting for the next one to air. Yes it is somewhat easy to predict some events and yes they do play the ""wtf"" card every now and then pulling crap out that makes no sense but for the most part it is very enjoyable to be a part of the ride. However, if this ends up being all that we get from No Game No Life anime adaptation wise, I will be very disappointed that we did not receive an ending of any sort. 
Animation: 10/10
MADHOUSE I freaking love you so much. Chihayafuru, Redline, Tatami Galaxy, and now this anime proves that they are the kings of beautiful, fluid animation. The character models are bouncy as ever (you know what I mean), facial expressions are spot on, lighting looks really good, action scenes are fluid as hell, and the colors are so vibrant. Every frame is like a beautiful work of art all on its own. Everything about the visual presentation is absolutely perfect; end of discussion.  
Sound: 9.9/10
Again so freaking spot on. All of the acoustic qualities fit right into what is being represented visually which is very key in providing the best experience possible. The voice actors match their characters on screen really well and the music is very fitting and sounds great.
In fact, the music is superb. One of the main reasons why the world feels so alive and also why each action scene seems so tense is because of how well the music and ambient sounds are mixed in with the visuals.  
The only real issue I had was in a couple rare cases there would be a moment where the sound almost appears to clip due to some intent on the studio's behalf. This just might be the copies of the video file I happened to use to watch but it seemed to appear three or four times. Regardless, this is an amazingly sounding anime.
Characters: 9/10
Now some people might not like the two main characters Shiro and Sora because they play the know it all, always in control of the situation type characters. The supporting cast are also not that unique in some cases and might be in some situations for just fanservice needs. What matters though is this simple thing; the characters are memorable, all of them. Yes the fanservice is strong in this one (Yoda talk) but the way the cast interacts with each other is so fluid and a blast to watch. They all just click with each other with such ease. So do they break out of the normal archetypes we see in almost all anime? No but you will remember so many funny, epic, and well...somewhat naked scenes for the foreseeable future for sure.
Overall: 9.4/10
This is a top notch, gloriously produced anime by a well known studio that has earned respect from so many people around the world. Whether or not ecchi ruins the experience for you, I COMMAND YOU to at least give this anime a good two or three episodes before you write it off. It is extremely funny, has a very flowing plot, has beautiful animation and sound design, and has a cast that will make any of your friendships seem boring. Kick back and shotgun this entire season for one hell of a ride.

                Ok ok. So... I feel like a lot of the anime I've been logging and reviewing have been about animes I've watched when I first getting into it. And ya this was one of my first animes and another one that I was probably too young to watch lol.
So, when I was getting into anime I also got into anime youtubers, and one of those youtubers was akidearest (I think that's their username). I'm pretty sure akidearest was my favorite anituber and I remember (at least at the time) aki would talk, make content or just like recommend No Game No LIfe. Sooo I decided
                  to watch it of course. 
So a few things before I get into what I do not like about this anime. 
1. The art in this anime is absolutely stunning I love it! The red line art is a unique (in anime/the animation medium) and amazing choice. I also quite like the colors as well as the character designs. 
2. The story, the core of the story is interesting and fun to me. And if this ever actually gets a 2nd season where the story continues tbh I would watch it. 
3. overall the anime if you turn off your brain or are just too young to probably be watching this you probably won't notice the not great bits. But not to sound like a little sensitive snowflake UwU SJW trans person (which isn't super wrong) but maybe sexualizing children (even in anime) is wrong?? crazy right??? It's so crazy how so many anime fans in like general jump through so many hoops to try an say it's ok. But in this situation you can't even use the classic argument of oh don't worry she's a 1,000 plus year old demon queen so it's ok. Cause Shiro in canon is like 11/12 it's so messed up. 
Ok so I've actually rewatched this show before somewhat recently. Since this anime came onto netflix and I decided hey lets rewatch it. And it was a still a somewhat fun time but I did definitely notice things I didn't before since I knew more and also had listened to other people share these concerns. And I am definitely am not saying you can't enjoy No Game No Life but you can't just sweep all the bad stuff under the rug you can still adknowledge these things while still enjoying this anime and thinking it's fun.
The last thing I have a problem with is the sexulization of all the women in this anime. Being sexual isn't bad reclaim your sexuality and be sexual if that is what you would like (of course if you are of age) and also don't put down other people for being sexual or not wanting to be sexual. do what makes you happy and what you enjoy and don't put others down for doing the things they like and want to do. 
Anyway, what I mean all the girls in NGNL no matter if they are legal or not are sexualized. Like Stephanie poor Stephanie could have done so much but no she was just turned into a fan service character and all the focus was put on her tits instead of her character. Though female characters being sexual (when they are legal of course) is not bad if they are doing it of their own accord. Like Jibril she is legal (so is Stephanie I think), but unlike Stephanie I at least feel as though she is doing it on her own but on the other hand Stephanie, Shiro and the little fox girl are all being sexualized without there own permission. Especially Shiro and the fox girl because they are both children and no matter if they were willy sexualizing themselves they couldn't do that cause they are children and children cannot consent.
Ok, ramble over. As much as some things in this anime may make me uncomfy it will still always have a place in my heart may it be quite a small place but I have so many memories (that are good) that involve this anime.",4,mo-mo-cats

                I honestly don't have that much to say about this one lol. I binged it in two sittings (with 4 hours of sleep between #sleepisfortheweak) and, well, it's fine.
This anime is the textbook example of a solid 8. Mostly a crowd-pleaser with some interesting themes and ideas that stand out and an overall creative unique concept. This anime really doesn't deserve any more than an 8 or any less. It's just... an 8... I really don't know what else to say lol. The characters are cool even though they can be annoying. Shiro and Sora are pretty awesome protagonists. The story line is creative, there's
                  continuity yadda yadda yadda. The characters are fine, the story is fine, everything is just fine. I would complain if I thought they could have executed it a lot better but I think they did the best they could. I mean the whole premise of the series is games so it's not really an anime meant to be taken seriously and anyone who does take it that way is probably a video game junky or something (no offense to any video game junkies reading this review).
There's not that much I didn't like. The fan service is a bit excessive, the way the main characters win games can make me a bit incredulous and most of the characters are just kinda bland and shallow. Like I said, t's just fine. The anime is fine, I don't know what else to say to be honest.
Feel free to watch it. There are a lot of better animes you could be watching but whatever. It's not like this one's bad. It's just FINE.

                LOVED it. 12 episodes, but each one made me smile so much my cheeks hurt. Jaw dropping, badass MCs. <3 This anime was pure fun. 
I loved how Sora and Shiro are as a team—two halves that make a whole. Individually, they have their strengths, but together, they make up for each other's weaknesses. They're both crazy smart, with their own quirks. I like how they read a lot, too. Even with their amazing skills, they still try to seek more knowledge on how to beat a game.
If I'm going to nitpick about what I didn't like about the series (which is hard since there's
                  so much I love about it), I'm not a fan of Steph. I feel like every other episode she continues to doubt Sora and Shiro and their ability. If it was me and I saw that kind of talent, I wouldn't question it. She does have her moments, though.

                I defenitely acknowledge this anime and can defenitely see why people like it so much, that said though, I really didn't enjoy it as much as i thought I would, first i thought it was because I had no real knowledge of the games they were playing, but I soon realised it was the boring and repetitive patterns, ""they didn't think they could win and then they win in a stretched out way"" I like thinking behind strategies, for example hunter x hunter and death note, you need to think which I don't mind, i actually quiet enjoy sometimes, my problem with no game no
                  life was probably because i couldn't understand what was going on in the first place, let alone understand how they won...
Anyway I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who absolutely does not like to use his brain, but if you do wanna watch it, then i wouldn't say you wasted your time because if you are really critical when it comes to watching then you might actually really really like it",7,AntiMatrix
19815,"
                I was initially unsure about this. The cover put me off, what I'd heard about it put me off and I'm not usually a fan of ""game"" animes. But I have to say, the 12 episodes standing by itself (forever hopeful for a S2) did impress me. 
Addressing the 'ecchi' tag and the fact that there's incest undertones, imo it wasn't that bad. It could've been much worse, although I will agree, there are some scenes that you might want to... lower the volume, or just not have on at all in front of people. At most, it'll be there for 30 seconds to a
                  minute, but it's not that off-putting. 
Which leads me to the genre. Okay, it's ecchi, so expect a decent amount of fan service, BUT, the humour is pretty standard. Sora's an 18 year old shut in who is pretty open about his pervertedness. This anime just so happens to have a MC who is an open pervert (not that I'm condoning it) and so the humour follows along those lines. It's witty, full of banter and sometimes dry. But, it works. Especially in this reality turning into fantasy type beat kind of show. 
Now with the characters, I like the personalities of Sora and Shiro. I like their relationship dynamic, I like the conversation that flows between them, and I like their interactions with the other characters. Sora is outgoing, confident and girl-motivated, but only when he's comfortable. As they're both shut ins, they consistently keep this trait of him and Shiro not being able to handle the ""outside world"" (or real world), which is a nice contrast to their usual selves. Then Shiro is unphased, calm and hella smart. 
Also, although most of the outcomes are somewhat predictable (them winning all the time), it's still super enjoyable for some reason? I can't predict what will happen in the episode or how they'll get there, but it's still exciting to figure out. That's probably why this is one of the few ""game"" animes I like. The plot is constantly unravelling and moving forward and the end goal is a pretty big one. 
And just the story overall is enjoyable. There's undertones of a life lesson which I appreciate. It might seem immature, catered to guys (because of the fan service) and shallow, but Sora and Shiro gaining and holding a high position in a world that's run by games mirrors how, I presume, some gamers feel. Unable to fit into society and the expectations, shut ins feel more themselves, more confident and at ease in a world they're used to. Where the rules make sense and where rules are followed. 
With games, the best person isn't automatically the person with the most influence, money or looks. It's usually purely on skill, effort or smarts. In this case, Sora and Shiro are crazy smart, and are able to fight back knowing what it's like to be at the bottom of society (in a sense). So, as weak people who have been there before, they are probably the best people to motivate the only race that has no extra powers. 
Aside from the story being pretty damn good, the art is bright, eye-catching and can sometimes make you dizzy. It looks unrealistic. But it works. The OP is super catchy, but other than that, I didn't really notice the soundtrack. My other favourite character next to the two mains is probably Steph. She's the classic air-head but after a couple episodes, I came to like her because she juxtaposed Sora and Shiro really well. Not to mention she was funny. Air-heads with good intentions with almost always have my heart. 
But overall, No Game No Life really did impress me. Pacing was decent and no episode felt like a filler, so I'd highly recommend this. It's only 12 episodes and the quality of writing was consistent throughout.",8,makotoplz
19815,"
                Season 2 when?
No Game No Life was one of the early isekai shows to really springboard the genre to the levels of popularity it's at today. What really drives this show to be so engaging, though, isn't it's setting so much as the high quality writing on display in the intricate plans our protagonist duo comes up with to always come out on top. Each new situation is so much more ridiculous than the last, yet our heroes never show any signs of fear and just keep winning anyway. It's a fun power fantasy type show with a lot of humor and plenty of fan
                  service. If you're one of those weirdos that gets disgusted by excessive fan service you should probably consider giving up anime as a hobby. Gatekeeping is a prime tenet of the religion of being a weeb and I'm just here to proselytize.
This show is excessively fun to watch and builds up to somewhat of a ""and their journey is just beginning"" ending. It left fans wanting more but the failure of the movie and low merchandise sales have kept a second season from ever surfacing. The sad fact of the matter is that animation costs money, and while there are individuals who may be passionate about the show itself the faceless corporations making it happen view the thing largely as a vehicle for advertising the source material and the merch surrounding it. If the anime fails at doing that they'll see no value in continuing it.

                The art, storyline/plot, and everything else is good but 1 thing ruins it for me. The incest and sexualization of minors. It would've been so good if the main characters didn't kiss each other and have some weird connection, especially when Sora is 7 years older than Shiro. People who give this a 10 are pretty messed up. This is the only review I'm doing for a reason because I can't understand y'all supporting the sexualization of minors it's not cute at all. I'm not going to try and write any spoilers since there's nothing wrong with the plot, but the fact that some people
                  can rate this a 10 without blinking doesn't sit right with me. Not to mention, this was actually recommended to me?? The whole sexualization and incest could've been avoided and the plot didn't have to change, there's no reason for the author to put that in the story. Sorry this is a bit long, I would keep this short but MAL reviews have to be pretty lengthy.",3,solotamer
19815,"
                No Game No Life is an admittedly straightforward and juvenile show that is still entertaining and even engaging due to its fun and laid-back nature. 
Sora and Shiro are shut-in siblings who share the username “Blank” and dominate every game they play. One day, they’re transported to Disboard, a fantasy world where games decide everything, and the siblings set their sights on becoming the new rulers of the gaming world. 
The main focus of No Game No Life is, rather obviously, the games themselves, which can be pretty much anything the players themselves decide. One would naturally expect the show to be strategic and psychological
                  in nature, with characters having to play mind games and form deep strategies to pull off a victory. Unfortunately, this isn’t really the case. 
The games they play are pretty untraditional, usually something the author made up himself or a typical game with a particular twist. While having nontraditional games is fundamentally interesting, it’s clear that it’s intentionally done this way in order for the author to make it easier to come up with twists or some form of tension. Characters don’t mainly use strategy; it’s more so that they bend the rules in their favor or even cheat, which is admittedly a plot point that they do address. That’s not to say that there’s absolutely no strategy, but it’s honestly somewhat shallow. Overall, it’s just a bit of a letdown. If you’re looking for some serious gambling story with maximum tension, you will not find that here. 
As for the overarching plot itself, it has a pretty interesting concept, and there are some unique plot twists and even a fair bit of world-building, though it’s nothing exceptional. The characters are pretty fun and likable, though they’re not complex at all and are mostly dominated by a single character trait. 
I know I’m making it sound bad, but that’s just me being objective. The great thing about No Game No Life is that it really doesn’t take itself that seriously. It acknowledges that it gets rather silly and tries to have fun with its plot and characters rather than tell some kind of serious and complex story, and honestly, I think it really succeeds with it. I genuinely had a lot of fun watching it (minus the ecchi stuff, especially the parts where it involved an 11-year-old girl), and it got a lot of laughs out of me. It’s the perfect kind of show to just sit back and have fun with. 
I wouldn’t go out of my way to recommend it to someone, especially considering the fact that there’s not even a second season, but if it looks interesting to you, I’d say check it out.",6,ceedot

                WARNING: Spoilers
Can someone please nerf these kids? 
No Game No Life had a good concept, that unfortunately ruined itself by pandering to certain people in the community who lack a moral compass. What a shame.
Plot: 6/10 
The concept is actually really, really good. As someone who enjoys video games the idea of an unbeatable force like Sora and Shiro existing and then getting transported to a world that's seemingly designed for them to live in and thrive - it's really interesting to say the least. However, what ruined a lot of it for me is fan-service throughout regarding Shiro, specifically. Argue that she is a fictional character and that it doesn't matter because she's not real, I simply will have to disagree - Shiro's character did not even have to be designed as a young girl but she was to cater towards older men who are into that kind of thing, and frankly, it's disgusting. I think most people who watched the anime were in fact, uncomfortable by the fan service around Shiro - but nobody cares enough because 'hey, she's not real, it's just a cartoon' right? It's deplorable to me regardless. Something being fantasy doesn't make it any less disgusting. There is also a scene where eight year old Izuna and eleven year old Shiro are bathing together, though this is one of the tamer scenes I will admit - I am not okay with it regardless. There's no plausible reason for the necessity of consistent panty shots of children, but anyway moving on.
The concept of mega Chad gamers is actually pretty awesome to me, like I mentioned before, so I was sure I would enjoy the show - however, the show didn't really take the gaming aspect into account much, and it was pretty easy to actually forget that Shiro and Sora were even gamers at all. That doesn't mean I dislike what they did with the direction of the show, or the characters logic and puzzle-solving ability, I just would've liked to see the gaming aspect integrated a bit more that's all. 
The pacing in the show actually starts off pretty decently, and then about midway through it gets a bit choppy - some stuff is paced too slowly, some stuff is paced a bit too quickly. Sometimes it felt like the problems were solved too quickly just because they had to get onto the next one for the sake of plot development, and on that note... 
Our main characters never fail. EVER. They're always top dogs, which, I get it, they're unbeatable, but until the very last episode it felt like they didn't even break a mental sweat. 
Characters: 4/10 
The characters aren't terrible and at times actually feel somewhat interesting, but any interesting qualities are usually dumbed back down with isekai tropes and fan service - I feel like the ecchi genre of this anime actually held it back quite a bit with regards to character development and depth, and if they'd have put a little more effort into making their characters interesting over sexy it very well could have been a 10/10 show. The main character is your bog-standard isekai trope through-and-through, so I'm not even going to bother talking about him.
Shiro is probably the most interesting character of them all, a super-smart, witty, tiny little girl that could mentally destroy you given the chance. She's interesting, but beyond her love for her brother and her intelligence, she really doesn't have much else to her. It's a same she's so one dimensional because honestly, she could've been one of my favourite characters ever if she'd had more depth. 
Steph exists purely for fan service, a weak plot device and as something to laugh at. Probably one of the most poorly written characters I've ever watched - which is a shame. 
Animation Design: 8/10 
By far the best part of the show is the animation, the colours are vivid and beautiful, the world-building through animation alone is immersive and each character is clearly designed with thought and care (even if their sole purpose is just to help the male audience feel a slight blood rush...). Even despite the brightness and seemingly neon-happiness of the colours, the art can at times be jarring too - it does a great job at setting atmosphere, and it's one of my favourite designed anime shows probably ever. Hats off for the animation, honestly. 
General Comments:
Like I said before, if this show didn't put so much of it's effort into ecchi and sexualising kids - it'd be amazing, probably one of the best in it's genre, but because it doesn't care about what normal people think and would rather pander to those who are still searching for their morality within the depths of loli characters and boobs-over-depth, it falls flat of anything remotely impressive.

                Recently i have binged many isekai anime just for fun and i was told this was gonna be one of the best, yeah i kind of raised my bar to high didn't i ?
Now this show is not bad in any way, it was a pretty enjoyable ride through and through. It has an interesting art style, a cool world building, a very fun fighting system, and many fanservice if you into those kind of stuff. But at the end of the day i didn't find this anime memorable in any way.
I think the problem lays with the characters, i don't feel attached in any
                  of them. So when to story flows i just think to myself ""oh yeah that's cool"" as supposed to ""wow that's amazing, i want to see more"". Because i didn't interested in the character in the slightest, i find myself pushing to finish this anime with a bit more effort than it should have.
The second problem has to do with the way sora & shiro win their games. most of them are fun to watch, mainly the chess and the wordplay ones were a lot of fun. The reason is those games are still believable enough to understand, therefore you have a cool fight. But the last two or three games where sora disappeared and war with the warbeast ones are to complex to be believable, therefore it makes me as the viewer lose the drive to care about sora and shiro efforts to win the game. 
of course i cannot speak for everybody but imo overall this is a pretty decent series. you will have a great time while watching it but i doubt you will remember this well enough after a week.",7,angel0_pr4t

                I have never written a review, and have never felt such a strong inclination to write a review. If there's one thing about this anime that's good, it's that it made me feel some type of emotion. Subtle anger? A pinch of disappointment? A dash of uncomfort? You name 'em! 
I'll start off with my little list of positives. Man, this anime looks good. It looks hot as hell. How can such a flaming pile of garbage look so good. I do admit I find the colors stunning, and I thought the world looks pretty damn cool. I appreciate that at least this was nice
                  to look at, and I do think that was the reason I decided to finish this hot mess. Props to the artists, who made this whole fiasco even slightly bearable. I love you guys, and I admit that most artists who work in the anime industry are really just drawing what they have to to get by. It's a shame that they had to be involved in the creation of such a dreadful creation.
Conceptually, as how most isekai go, it seems interesting in concept, in execution, a pretty underwhelming, or just a strange, ""why did you do that,"" type delivery. No Game No Life is the latter. It's a pretty basic/predictable story with some weird anime bullshit thrown in to attract the targeted virgin gamer audience. The humor, itself, is very repetitive and predictable. I have no problem with this, and would never rate an anime so awfully if it was just up to repetitive humor, especially because I do like the artwork. However, what No Game No Life passes off as comedy is ""gamer main character sees panty, ooga ooga, panty, funny."" And this makes me really look deeper into what weird shit is being shown and passed off as silly little jokes. I believe the story itself is really just a vehicle for some really weird, perverted, pedophilic, and horribly awkward incestuous fan service. 
My biggest problem with No Game No Life, really, is the overt sexualization of women. Take a look at the characters, and most of them are blank slates with boobies for Sora to rip the clothes off of repeatedly while the audience claps their sticky little fingers together. And yes, this includes his 11-year-old little sister, Shiro. Many scenes depict her being sexualized. I don't even want to get into how uncomfortable these scenes are. Yes its fictional, but you sit there and can see the obvious sexualization of a child's body. She acts how a child would act despite her intelligence, and this is the body of a child being exposed uncomfortably, fiction or not. It's not acceptable in any sense. This was very intentional, and it was made for a very specific species of incel, weirdo, lolicon piece of shit, or at the very least, to normalize such expectations. 
One of the things that makes me angry about this anime, and the industry in general, is how normalized the sexualization of little girls, and how common the unconsensual sexualization of women has become in anime. This will repeat, over and over, and people will love it each time, no matter how bland the story or the characters. All these people care about is getting off to anime, even if they are looking at what is represented as an 11 year old child, and in a lot of cases, even younger, children's bodies. No Game No Life passes as a humorous way to sexualize to uncomfortable amounts, and somewhat serves as a gateway into thinking this should be the standard of entertainment. 
Overall, anime has treated me very well and I've enjoyed a lot of the things I've watched. In no way am I saying all anime contribute to the harmful extent that I believe shows like No Game No Life does. But, whenever I come across media like this, I wonder where people are willing to draw the line between what is comedy, and what is objectification. I certainly don't think No Game No Life is a positive step towards anime in the future. It does nothing spectacular, and personally I believe it normalizes extremely harmful topics we've seen in anime for years.",2,peachsanitizer

                Forewarning; this is my personal favorite anime and I will likely be extremely biased.
NGNL (No Game No Life) is the story of 2 exceptionally skilled gamer siblings who somehow end up in a fantasy world where everything is decided by games. If you are already disinterested, move on. It heavily parodies and references a lot of anime and video game themes. This sometimes includes parodying things like needless fan-service, common video-game themes, overused genre tropes etc..
The overall story is fairly simple small scale, but there are plenty of opportunities for the story to be more interesting and grand over a multitude of seasons if it
                  gets more series. At the time of writing this there is only 1 with the prequel movie coming soon, and the story definitely continues after this season.
The story conforms to the rules of this world that has been made entirely for the series, which is convenient and also a bit disappointing, as it means the story can be somewhat predictable.
The art style is very unique and definitely has an appeal, strong outlines and vibrant colored scenes dominate almost every second of the series. The world is both beautiful and well designed. The animations where necessary are always of great quality and any vfx look clean and satisfying. Whether or not you personally enjoy the style is up to your own subjection.
Audio wise, the music is great and the sfx is well made. I have watched both the English and Japanese version of the series. Though it is rare, this is one anime I would actually say some of the English voice actors did a better job, especially for Sora and Jibril, and I lean towards the English Stephanie too, however the Japanese Shiro is far superior. (I am a native English speaker with little no to knowledge of Japanese) So whatever your preference, but the dub by Sentai is very good.
The characters are entertaining and humorous. Most of the characters are very unique as they don't usually fall into classic anime tropes other than the main 2 characters. Most cliche occurrences of characters are intentional parodies of something anyway.
Overall the entire series is enjoyable from start to finish, it has a perfect mix of comedy, action, adventure, and fantasy. It is a fun world that is interesting to learn and explore along with the quirky and well mixed set of characters.",10,dbwvozz

                Story
Nothing too special about the story. Main characters are transported to a new world where things are dictated by games. Unfortunately these are boring uninspired games that feel like second rate replications of better game anime. The games are shallow and lack a lot of depth as well. It also becomes quite apparent that the main characters cant lose due to their plot armor, that really ruins the tension of these boring games. 
Art
The art style and animation is quite unique and is pretty to look at. 
SoundThe opening is pretty good, the rest of the music not as memorable. 
Character
Probably one of the worst aspects of the entire show. The main leads are nothing new in anime and lack enough personality to lead a series. The main  male lead's relationship with his younger step sister is also questionable as well. Supporting characters fare even worse than the main cast. I found it difficult to be invested in them. 
Enjoyment
This series feels like such a second rate replication of other anime. The games are dull, uninspired compared to the games in better series like the first season of Yu-gi-oh. Some of these shallow games are spread way too thin as well. The characters are boring as well, I did not find myself invested in them at all. The ecchi elements are not very good either, there are too many panty shots of the younger step sister. Isn't she like 12 years old? If you want to watch better games, watch Yu-gioh, If you want ecchi, watch prison school. Everything this anime does, some other show does much better.
Overall
This is one of the most dull, uninspired series I have ever watched. The popularity is very puzzling to me. Found myself falling alseep several times. Despite it being 12 episodes, it felt longer. I do not recommend this series",4,Awoo4U

But if a have something to bad to say a about this serie is that I'd to short and it needs more that 12 episodes like a 50 episodes would be good.

                the world is very interesting and i think sora as the main character couldve been more interesting but no matter how interesting the world was all the loli shit just brought it down a lot, i'd rather not see the 11 year old's pants every time something happens and then see her flirt with her own brother and while shiro as a character is somewhat decent, her utility couldve and shouldve been used for more than ""hey i hope youre into underage girls cuz BOY do i have the thing for you also I have a depressing back story and im really good at chess
                  and also im smart but only for one arc!"".
Apart from that Jibriel, Tet and Stephanie are pretty good characters but like, thats it for the characters that are actively good. Sometimes Stephanie can be a total fucking idiot but hey I can look past that.
If you're here for world building ideas, NGNL is for you
If you're here for artistic inspiration, NGNL is a good basis

If you're here for weird loli shit, NGNL is for you
If you're here for incest shit, NGNL is for you

Honestly if the weird underage fanservice shit wasn't there this would've been a good watch, but no. A perfectly good world with perfectly good characters just had to be fucking soured because the author cant keep it in their pants about underage girls.
Honestly time spent watching this show could be better spent watching better shows that DONT have paedophilic undertones but hey if you wanna watch it for inspiration of some sorts, its a good show artistically to watch if. In a vacuum - away from the weird pedo shit - the art is very good.

                The anime that made me finally write my first and hopefully last review just because of how painful it was to watch.
NGNL is just a subpar anime overhyped to the moon and back.
The story is somewhat interesting but is written poorly. Also, there is lots of fanservice so better be careful with where you're watching.
The characters are simply not likeable at all and/or extremely forgettable for me, with the exception of maybe one or two. 
Main characters: A borderline insane guy with the sexual drive to rival that of a rabbit's and his loli stepsister who hovers like a drone around him. Both have some
                  questionable chemistry between them. Good for the lolicons, probably.
Support characters: Most of them just serve as fanservice fuel.
The artstyle is okay, but the colors are way too vibrant for me. It feels like they cranked the saturation up to 11 on everything.
The sound is nothing outstanding either. It's like many other shows out there.",4,nideko

                Usually I can overlook the fanservice model that a large sum of animes like to incorporate into their art, but this show takes it to a new level and it's honestly appalling to me. The premise of the anime to the point where I stopped watching, is that a brother and sister combo are the best gamers in the human world and ultimately get transported to a new world. Sounds like a fun idea, but the direction the show takes is just shoving nudity down your throats, including the 11 year old sister.

But on the other hand, the characters and story felt super generic. It is supposed to be interesting watching Sora and Shiro figure out and win each game, but I ended up feeling let down every time because they always seem to just make up their own rules in the end. To put it bluntly, the series

First episode I was already thinking about quitting it because it was so boring but the more you watch, the more interested you get.

Pros is that the Art and graphics is so beautiful. I had high hopes it would be good after watching episode

                The animation has a odd bright colored tint to it. Perhaps to give it a video game feel. The characters were not well written. They were either too perverted, or lacked sense. Stephanie Dola was basically a damsel in distress, could not do anything for herself. This was written in a way that it took away from the anime. The male character was basically a pedophiliac incestuous creep. 
The humor in the anime was hard to watch. It was perverted. There was a disappointing brother and sister romance. The perversion of the main character to all women/girls did nothing, but take away from the show.
                  
The logic behind the games were interesting and well written. Even with that in mind, the writers found a way to include perversion. It was intensely disappointing. The unnecessary sexuality, brother and sister romance ruined this anime. If you actually want to watch an anime with real substance, or that is humorous this is not for you.

                incest, pedophilia, incest, unnecessary ecchi, incest, incredible games, did I mention pedophilia? and a very nice Jibril.
No Game No Life has its ups and downs, but surely the lows, even though they are a minority, give the highs a beating and spoil the whole experience of accompanying the protagonists on their incredible journey to become the new gods of the games.
You can call me abnormal, because I like isekai, okay?
You may not even like No Game No Life, but you cannot disagree that the design of the Disboard world, to which Sora and Shiro were sent, is incredible, it is the kind of anime place
                  that I would love to visit if it existed. It is also one of the most beautiful scenes of anime, in my opinion.
Anyway, the main story of no game no life is incredible, the games are very well elaborated and the narrative surprised me even though it was an ecchi anime. I would really like to watch the finale and see Sora and Shiro defeating Tet and becoming the gods in that world.
I liked the anime, but that is no reason to ignore or wipe away all sexualization, pedophilia, incest and ecchi completely unnecessary around Shiro, who is only 11 years old, and the other female characters. The worst part is the relationship between Sora and Shiro, who is 18 and 11 years old, in addition to being brothers, even if adopted. It is not certain how they act with each other.
But apart from this very significant little detail the games are incredible and I can say that Sora and Shiro are a great pair of >> players <<.
I can't forget to mention that impeccable opening, which for a long time was in my top 10. That opening is perfect, that's it.

No Game No Life tem seus altos e baixos, mas com certeza os baixos, mesmo sendo minoria, dão uma surra nos altos e estragam toda a experiência de acompanhar os protagonistas em sua jornada incrível para se tornarem os novos deuses dos jogos.
Pode me chamar de anormal, porque eu gosto de isekai, tá?
Você pode até não gostar de No Game No Life, mas não pode discordar que o design do mundo de Disboard, para qual Sora e Shiro foram enviados, é incrível, é o tipo de lugar dos animes que eu adoraria conhecer se existisse. Também é um dos cénarios mais bonitos dos animes, na minha opinião.
Enfim, a história principal de no game no life é incrível, os jogos são muito bem elaborados e a narrativa me supreendeu mesmo sendo um anime ecchi. Eu realmente gostaria de assistir ao final e ver Sora e Shiro derrotando o Tet e se tornando os deuses naquele mundo.
Eu gostei do anime, mas isso não é motivo pra ignorar ou passar pano pra toda a sexualização, a pedofilia, o incesto e o ecchi completamente desnecessário em torno da Shiro, que tem apenas 11 anos, e das outras personagens femininas. A pior parte é a relação de Sora e Shiro, que tem 18 e 11 anos, além de serem irmãos, mesmo que adotivos. Não é certo o modo como eles agem um com o outro.
Mas fora esse pequeno detalhe muito significativo os jogos são incríveis e eu posso afirmar que Sora e Shiro são uma ótima dupla de >>jogadores<<.

                An overly color-saturated anime with a good base idea with a bad execution's with an almost unlikeable main character and his a bit more likeable sister.
The main boy character is a genius but comes off as a smug brat that threats less intelligent people (basically everyone else in the universe except for her sister) like garbage or close to it - the constantly picks on a girl that's also supposed to be a main character but barely does anything except being bullied and humiliated throughout the show (because that's funny for today's kids I suppose).
The execution is bad because this is the typical work of
                  someone who tries to write characters smarter than the writer - the result is to never show how they actually do stuff (like how is NEVER shown a single game of chess despite being prominent in the anime), or how they get to their crazy conclusions that ""Magically"" always end up to be true.
If you wanna an example of a good written intelligent character look at Death Note and see the difference in there - characters there aren't ""Implicit"" smart (e.g. ""They do smart things but I don't show you how), they are ""Explicit"" smart (e.g. ""They do smart things AND I ACTUALLY SHOW YOU their thought process).
Not to mention there's a buttload of nonsense, especially in the last game of the anime, where they fight in a sort of Virtual Reality shooting game - now someone explain me HOW exactly being smart and good at video games and games in general magically also makes you a perfect marksman: You're aren't firing a gun with your PC mouse, your fighting a gun that's actually in your hand, NOT THE SAME GODDAM THING - but who cares, the two main characters are supposed to be perfect, aside from some minor quirks, so don't question.
The anime overall is barely enjoyable if you turn off your brain, which is usually something you're supposed to do in more goofy - comedy - nonsense type of anime (say for example, Nichijou), but here is a bit hard since the anime tries to sell itself as ""Super smart"" so basically asks you to keep your brain on while at the same time throwing so much nonsense that wouldn't stand 2 seconds of scrutiny...",6,whatever5464

                One word to describe this anime series: Interesting. 
I'll be honest, I don't hold this series in high regard. The story/plot is intriguing at first, but it sort of falls apart in the later episodes. Maybe I would change my mind if a new season came out. Haha. The art of this series is good. Very good art for its time. And personally, I think that the characters are not the best-written characters. Their personalities were small. And about the plot, I just don't understand it, I guess. It's not a serious story because, as I mentioned before, it falls apart in the later episodes.
                  Some people can say that it has comedy. But I feel that the ""comedy"" is just immature. It could almost be an ecchi. Some parts of this series were really fun to watch, though. Like this one chess scene in the early episodes. I guess the best part about the plot is the unexpected and hilariously dumb twists. I would love to give examples, but it would be inconsiderate to those who are still watching or about to start the series as there would be spoilers.

                A fun anime wherein the twists are unpredictable enough that I can still enjoy it, despite the leads being pretty strong.
There is an attempt at balancing their OP nature by showing their socially awkward tendencies but it's played more for laughs and therefore doesn't completely create that balance. They also try to make games more complex in order to have their battles be longer and less predictable, so the intrigue is less about asking ""will they make it?"" and more asking ""how do they make it?"".
There are a lot of ecchi scenes, but I don't think the anime acts above that and that's part of
                  the silly enjoyment. If anything, did you not come here for that?!? Some people may be uncomfortable with the sibling relationship in that regard, so if incestuous vibes bother you, this is probably not the show you should be watching {the siblings themselves don't say they have that kind of relationship, even arguing the opposite, but the actions are still there}.

the plot seems somewhat mediocre to me although it is not a boring or complex story but it is easy to understand and follow it.
his comedy is also very meh or very common generic, what I didn't like is an scene in the shower that sexualized an 11-year-old girl, that did go too far,

What I don't like is that the series was left unfinished and they didn't adapt the other 7 volumes that needed to be adapted and that they didn't do a 2nd season, I think they canceled it.
The 8-year-old hybrid violet-haired girl made me very cute (I don't consider her a furry or anthropomorphic because she doesn't have some with the characteristics to be one, she is far from being a furry)",6,yesirena-otaku14

                Another one that I won't be doing a full review of. I watched this for three reasons. 1)My roommate was watching it and said he enjoyed it 2)I dug the aesthetic 3)It was convenient to watch since it was on Netflix. I did not enjoy it. At all. I made it through 1 and a half episodes before I chose to give up. I was at my breaking point with the amount of jiggling anime tiddies, panty shots, and squealing that came from our main protagonist, his little sister, and the other characters that our dynamic video game duo are able to beat with their
                  ""video game prowess"".
*Side note: is it just me or does it bother anyone else how often brothers and sisters in anime call each other ""brother"" or ""sister"". No wonder there's an incestuous fetish in porn lol! I don't think I have ever once called my sister ""sister"" when referring to her in my entire life! Ughhh and they said she was 11. Why the hell was the first time we ever saw her in the show teasing the audience with a camera angle that was super suggestive of a panty shot? Gross.*
But anyway, the last scene I saw before I gave up on this show I want to compare it to a similar one in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Both of these shows have a high-stakes gambling scene that involves the protagonist outsmarting his opponent by forcing them to believe that they are bluffing. JoJo's version established the stakes by having the antagonist have the upper hand and to showing him beat Jotarao's friends prior to. The game picks up in its intensity right until the end where we find out who won. No Game No Life's version never really makes you feel the stakes as the brother Sora is pretty much shown to be this god-tier player at all games and we are never once doubting his capability of losing. He even makes up the rules to the game of Rock, Paper, and Scissors in the hopes that his opponent, named Big Tits, would think that she had an advantage. However, only an idiot would agree to the terms that he made and her line of reasoning throughout the game was really hard to watch. And to make matters worse, it leads to a super over-the-top ecchi scene with a classic ""male protagonist falls and his hand lands on the voluptuous female character's boob"" trope, But to amp it up a bit, the little sister encourages her ""virgin brother"" and says she's ok with watching and even pulls out her phone. After a temper tantrum thrown by both of our protagonists, it leads to Big tits and his sister taking a bath together with the brother hoping to try to peek at them and even making an ""FBI open up!!!"" joke about what would happen if he were to bathe with his sister.
Yeah... this show is everything that I don't like about Shonen anime but amped up.
Final Verdict: 1/10 The color scheme for the show really is gorgeous. But that's the only good thing I'll say about it. This show is the epitome of what people who don't watch anime think of people who do. if that makes any sense. Incest, big boobs, video games, and obnoxious monologing in fights. The most not-for-me anime ever made... so far. Hence me struggling to get through the three episode rule.",1,Lab_Mem_Num001

                gamers go to a magic gamer world with games and teams because gamers are bored of life. Slap some neon or colorful art on the anime and you got a certified seasonal fame bomb.
So we have Sora and Shiro, genius shut-in gamers, in other words, NEETS, people that don't work or do much, just chill. Shiro is Sora's stepsis and they're both geniuses that think of life as a game, a boring one too so they just game all day. They get an email to participate in some chess match and like all good isekai characters, they accept a random email that has the power
                  to get them into another world, they meet the ""game god"" and start playing. they do some unrealistic stuff and did I forget to mention this is an ecchi, at least they covered the incest thing with Shiro/Sora being stepsiblings. The ecchi is there, expect an overall spicy mood and being able to see panties or just everybody dressing hot. 7/10, another isekai. Had some nice comedy to it but is overall quite poor. in reality a 6 but I will give it a 7.
Art, cool neon/color bleeding art, on top of that, it is very colorful and the detail is quite nice. For 2014 this is like an 8 or even 9. I am giving it an 8
Sound, The 3 songs it featured were quite good. 8/10, nice music and lyrics, overall sounded good.
Characters. I will cover the stepsiblings since they are the most well known, Sora, well he is smart. That is both good and bad since he seems to be bored sometimes since he can do things so easily. He looks alright but isn't a legendary character. Shiro is very cute, the best girl and loli, quite well known, pretty nice personality, nothing special but just cute and smart. 9.5/10 for her. The other characters like Dola just do random shit or are very hot. 8/10
Overall, a fun anime, the story isn't anything insane and it can get a bit repetitive or boring at times, it simply has a very poor pace and not too much other than comedy and cute characters to make up for that. I would say it is alright, 7.5/10 (7). I would say it is worth watching since it is very popular and all that and you might like it more or less than me.",7,Alex_Jaro

                No Game No Life was an anime that tried so hard to mix: gambling games with Isekai and fantasy elements, and it worked so perfectly. This anime was so impressive since the 1st episode. Well, is it can be an anime that mixes Kakegurui and Re:Zero??? HECK YES, and it just fitted so perfectly, like a coin, right? And I don't understand why an perfect anime has some bad reviews. I really wanted to give a red card to those people, because if you guys didn't like of No Game No Life, I mean: review your tastes, right? So, let's start!
Story: 9/10
[WARNING: SPOILERS AND SPOILERS,
                  AS ALWAYS]
The story is about two twin-brothers called Sora and Shiro, and both of them are really great gamers, that doesn't leave their house. But one day, the two were invoked, by an mysterious entity called Teto, to another world. And the only way that Sora and Shiro can go out from this world is playing gambling games with people of Elquia empire, respecting all the rules on this world, which are basically: 
【1】 All bloodshed, war, and pillage is forbidden throughout the world.
【2】 All disputes are to be resolved through the outcome of games.
【3】 In games, wagers will be made on what both parties decide to be of equal value.
【4】 Unless contrary to ""Three"", the game content and the things wagered do not matter.
【5】 The challenged party has the right to decide the contents of the game.
【6】 ""As per the Oath"", the wager will be unconditionally adhered to.
【7】 All matters for group conflicts will be decided by a representative.
【8】 If cheating is detected during a game, it will be regarded as a defeat.
【9】 The above rules are unconditionally everlasting, upheld in the name of God.
【10】—— Everyone should get along while playing games.
So, if they get to win against the majority of the people on Elquia empire (and turn themselves to the substitute kings of the empire), they're able to play against Teto (the God of the Games on this alternative world). And if they win against him, they can go out of this world. Well, I can't think in any anime, that have an identical premise. It clearly exists some of them that have some similar, but not the same. After Re:Zero, I found No Game No Life: the second best Isekai anime ever. Because it's so intriguing on all the times, especially with the presence of Sora (which is the most badass protagonist on the entire anime). And I mean, a lot of militant people (mainly on Twitter, because this specific social media is a mess right now) are talking bad about No Game No Life, because they found this anime: very offensive, when it comes to: 1 - unnecessary ecchi; 2 - pedophilia (which doesn't make any f*cking sense); 3 - incest; and 4 - the female characters having big tits, being a very exploitable thing. So, these people doesn't have any idea of what they're talking about. Have you seen the age rating of No Game No Life on the Netflix? Well ............................. IT'S 18+, so what could you expect about this? Did you think that this show would be an light anime, with no exaggerated things??? Bruh, th-th-the fact that you didn't like of this show (about those reasons) is misleading. Sorry, but you're passing shame, right? Because is not today that japaneses puts some ecchi on their animes, this is something that we really need to conform nowadays. We have many many shounen and Isekai animes, that have the ecchi in some scenes, such as: Boku No Hero, Fire Force, and etc. But those people just thought that the ecchi on No Game No Life was too forced. And I mean: NO!!! If you think on that way, you only just paid attention on the ecchi, not on the story itself. The premise was something that I already thought that: it will be badass. And it was. But the fact that some people just gave hates to this anime (due to the unnecessary ecchi and wrong things) is basically the same when it comes to criticize the big tits' element on Uzaki-Chan, for example. Those animes just suffered by this reason, but it didn't affect the audience. Most of the people, including me, just liked No Game No Life so much, and it collected a lot of money. So, about the unnecessary ecchi, it's already explained. Now, speaking about the pedophilia and incest on this anime, bruh: what the hell are you thinking about? Ok, this is something that I need to agree: it's visible. But, as the ecchi, those elements don't affect the fact that No Game No Life is a perfect anime. The incest (which is something very dumb to think it has on the anime) is not an hardcore thing, and it doesn't almost exists. Same for the pedophilia on this anime, bruh. I'm laughing so hard and feeling pity of those people, while I'm typing my review, but okay. So, this aspect isn't also an heavy thing. And about the girls' big tits on this anime, I mean: what would you expected? Uzaki-chan was so dropped down, due to militant girls on Twitter that disrespect Uzaki's body and her tit size, because it's something very hard to have on the real life. But, you're comparing an human being with an anime character (an imaginary person). Sorry, but it's so funny. So, the fact that some people didn't like it about these aspects, well, it doesn't make the anime worse. You can see, on MAL, that: the most of the otakus liked of this show. And because, they aren't giving a f*cking single care to those things. Any animes have this (the ecchi, some of them are more hardcore, but another of them are more softcore), and those people are revoking beings that don't exist on the real life. Sorry, but I feel pity for these community. So, I gave to the story an 9/10, because I'm not militant (that invoke with anything), and all the moments on No Game No Life just gave to me a lot of goosebumps. It was freaking amazing, I need to say. Clearly, it has some moments that it was a punch to the feels: the fact the Stephanie Dola lost her father (the king of Elquia) is very sad, but she's so funny on the anime, that I cried with laughter in a lot of moments. So, yeah! 9/10. I'm not an boring person (militant), and the story was perfect.
Art: 9/10
So, at the first look, I noticed that the art-looking of this anime was so clear and shiny, that I was like: ""wow, it hurts my eyes"". And it is on the entire anime, but it wasn't something that really stressed me. I thought: well, No Game No Life was produced by Madhouse studio, and this studio is so great about the animation art quality. We can see a lot of animes from this studio, that has: a stunning art (such as Claymore, Overlord, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Wolf Children, and etc.). And with No Game No Life, well...... it was good, we can't say that the art was bad, but sometimes it can be lacking. But the character design and the scenarios were so perfectly worked. The scenarios are very realistic, at the first look, and we saw a lot of scenes with beautiful looking lightning bolts and strikes (which was so stunning). Again, we can expect big things coming from Madhouse (such as: beautiful animations, good hecking stories), and they made a good thing again. No Game No Life, when it comes to the art design,  delivered a great experience. The colors are so vivid, and clearly it had some moments that left me gaping, because it's stunning, right? The only deffect is: it can be so shiny and hurtful to your eyes, sometimes. But, excluding this aspect, the art is very perfect, the character design can be simple sometimes (specially about the eyes that, sometimes, they don't have emotional or pretty eyes), but this fact doesn't matter so much. The art is gorgeous, as a lot of animes from Madhouse. So, 9/10, my man it's was so gleaming to look, and an collyrium to my eyes. And I bet a lot of people think the same.
Sound: 10/10
The soundtracks, on literally all the time, are an unbelievably great element on No Game No Life. The opening song was so beautiful and very great to hear, and the background soundtracks just fits on the right moments, all the time. We saw a lot of scenes that shows games between Sora (and Shiro) against another people, and the soundtrack on the background is something fantastic. There's some funny moments, some goose-bumpy moments and some sad moments, and clearly we have soundtrack to fit to all these moments. DAMN, I was hecking impressive to this element. The ending was also very good, and the fact that Isekai animes doesn't need to have excentric songs (to be good) just makes No Game No Life better with the course of the episodes. And the soundtracks with musical keyboard (in the most of the scenes) just makes this anime cooler and more intriguing. So, there's nothing too much to talk about the soundtrack. Again, Madhouse studio is a very studio when it comes to sound aspects (specially with the One Punch Man's opening songs, which were so remarkable, right?). And with No Game No Life, it turned to the same thing. So, it's something that you can't deny that it's great. IT'S AN FACT. I gave it 10/10, and sorry. I know I can give a lot of 10/10s for many animes, but I don't like to be so harsh and critic, okay? 10/10.
Character: 9/10
YES, 9/10. Again, I don't care if the girls have big tits (this is just an stupid implication). The thing that is really important is: the character development. So, on No Game No Life, it was an insanely great point. Sora is the best one (and the most badass on the entire anime). Basically, the main characters are: Sora, the badass guy, that is insanely good on online games; Shiro, his sister, which is very shy, a girl of few words, and helps Sora when he's in trouble on their games (again, both of them are very good gamers); Stephanie Dola; a very shameful, outgoing and very funny girl, that isn't so good with gambling games (and she was the daughter of Elquia's king); Chlammy Zell, an half-elf girl that born without remembering about her mother, and she can be a very skilled girl at the first look, but she's also very shy and very unsecure with herself sometimes (specially when she was a little child, which she was cared by the half-demon elf girl called Feel); Feel Nilvalen and Jibril, the two main half-demons elf girls, which are the most powerful elfs on this alternative world (and especially on the movie, when they two are fighting themselves, and I'll definitely watch No Game No Life: Zero movie later). So, the characters were really well developed, clearly it would be very interesting if this anime would show the past of them (even though it was showed a little bit the past of Sora and Shiro, which Shiro is the step-sister of him, but it wasn't explained so good at all. It just showed some takes, but it wasn't enough, at least for me). But, the character personality development was insanely good, there's no way to consider this point as a bad point, because bruh....... to go straight to the point: THIS ANIME JUST BLEW MY MIND. The experience of watching was so hecking, and I'm not sucking the balls of No Game No Life. NO!!!! LOL, but after Re:Zero, the Isekai anime world really just pushed me, and I'm amazed with this type of genre right now. Re:Zero and No Game No Life are the best Isekais of all the time, you can judge me, but it's almost like a true (a fact that we can't disagree). So, 10/10, the fact the it didn't showed the characters didn't frustrated me. 10/10, sorry but I can't hold it, because I'm not an heavy critic!
Enjoyment: 9/10
Overall: 9/10
So, overall, the story was good, but it lost -1 point, because of the final. Between the first episode, and the fight between Sora and Shiro against Izuna (the little grandchild girl of Ino Hatsune, an ancient man, that leads an santuary with girls in the form of cat with big tails, which turned to a little fetish for Sora, lol) were the best moments. But the last episode was clearly a filler. No Game No Life has an unconclusive ending, which leave us wondering the biggest quesition: will Sora and Shiro get out of this world? Will they win against Teto, the God of the Gamers? Well, WE STILL DON'T KNOW!!! Fans claimed that the movie doesn't explain about that (that it's more an darker version of the original story, because it shows an Sora with white hair, and an Shiro in robotic version, facing a big disaster and destruction on this world, due mainly to the fight against Feel Nilvalen and Jibril). I'll definitely watch the movie later, but the movie wasn't an conclusion for the story. It's more like an adaptation of another manga collection (that doesn't have anything about Sora and Shiro). But, considering the amount of money that the creator got with this anime (speaking about the sells of blu-ray and the original material), it's more like an obligation to have a season 2, but there's one polemic point: the final of the anime was changed, because they adapted only the first three volumes of the manga. And for the final, they skipped the volume 4 and 5, and went straight to the volume 6. So, it was a little bit sketchy, because if they skipped some volumes: how can they produce a good season 2? (especially talking about the start of the season 2). It was a little doubtful this choice, because now we need to know: how will they produce a good season 2, but I'm having my hopes high. I mean, a lot of fans just looked in a ugly way to the movie, because they really wanted an season, not an movie. And for that reason (that they just skipped some manga volumes) made me being with a strange feeling, because when I watched the ending of the anime, I also felt something strange with that, and I just did an research on Google (about the chances of season 2 of No Game No Life), and I found this specific adversity: that they skipped some manga volumes. And I was thinking like: NO, HECK NO, HECK NO, THEY DIDN'T DO IT! But, I'm still getting my hopes high, because the No Game No Life's fandom is very very big nowadays, and I know: a lot of people are also talking about this anime so much. So, it's an obligation to have an season 2. I finish my review right there, and I was kinda disappoiting about the ending of No Game No Life, but: I know this anime has a big hype, so it will clearly have (in a near future), a season 2! It's fact! Have a nice day guys, and bye bye!",9,tomioka_hashira

                I watched the first episode a few years ago out of curiosity and just never followed up due to the nature it seemed the story was going. 
Then all I heard was how people loved this anime, so I gave it a second try. And I honestly can't seem to understand how people *love* this anime. Its decent at the start. I find it hard to watch the brother and sister interact together. The overall premise of the show isn't horrible - I typically love isekai animes, but this one fell short. The story does not do a good job of making you feel good
                  about their wins. You never really experience them lose. So you always know the outcome, which just isn't entertaining to me. There is no one that is smarter or stronger than them in the anime - so you just always know that even though they are in a tight situation, they are going to win. There is no growth in their character. It's underwhelming. 
The art is beautiful. Lots of colors and creativeness. 
But I cannot understand the love that people feel for the story, it just came off really boring to me. I kept watching waiting for that ""oh this is why people love it"" moment and it never came.",4,Loboasarus

                If you are an amateur weeb who finished all the popular anime and want to try something else, No game no life is for you
I wouldn't say its the best anime but you should definitely watch it, its pretty enjoyable, you can finish it in one day.
The story is about Sora and Shiro, two gamers who are the best gaming experts in the world ( literally) The two of them find themselves in another world where EVERYTHING is decided on games and challenges, It shows the different adventure and new challenges the two of them will have to face.
I know the story sounds a bit
                  odd and plain, but trust me it will blow your mind",8,4YE5H4
