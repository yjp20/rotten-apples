I watched this film at Anime Expo 2016 Los Angeles. I'll try to keep my review as spoiler-less as possible.
TL;DR:The film holds true to all the expectations of a Makoto Shinkai production, from heartfelt smiles to crying the 5th time within the last 30 minutes. His signature metaphorical use of trains, the idea of a hopeless and distant love, and beautiful scenery really dive you emotionally into the story, even for how generic and simple it may seem. 
Story: 7
The story is fairly straightforward; It's very easy to guess where the story will head, but that doesn't mean to say I didn't enjoy it. It warrants a 7 simply because I felt a lack of emotional depth from the characters. This lacking depth makes me constantly question the characters' actions throughout the film, and because I am constantly searching for a motivation for their actions besides purely as plot devices, I am effectively removed from the immersion. However, this does not take away from my overall score which I shall highlight later.
Art: 10
As expected of a Makoto Shinkai film, the artwork is beautiful. The production quality is off the charts. The art in itself is enough to evoke tears, as it did for me during even the trailer. His choice of colors and use of movement and focus within the frame really help you pay attention to what you need to pay attention to, while also not skimping out and leaving out detail if your eyes do decide to stray, which I recommend you do while watching any Makoto Shinkai film for every blur, light flare, and particle floating along the screen really do add incredible amounts of emotion to the scene. My friends and I consider most Makoto Shinkai films as ""5 Wallpapers per Second"" and for good reason. 
Sound: 9
Granted I watched this film in an auditorium with hundreds of people, I can't give an accurate score as of writing this review. I don't know who did the music for the film, but during the Q&A Panel held with Shinkai, he mentioned that he messaged one of his favorite bands that he was working on a film, and wanted them to do the music, to which they said yes. 
EDIT 7/25/2016:
The music was done by the band RADWIMPS, a Japanese rock/alternative rock band. Some people have come to me asking whether or not this took away from the cinematic or emotional feel of the film, but in my opinion it helped in a way characterize the characters of Mitsuha and Taki. Rock music carries with it a sense of youth. Bringing that youthful feeling to the film's soundtrack helps to establish the sense of naivety to the characters and their interactions. It really helps establish the characters as teenagers who don't know or care about right from wrong, but rather would do what they feel in their heart is the right thing to do, which is exactly what motivates Mitsuha and Taki in their adventure.
Character: 7
I wouldn't say I have much of a complaint about main characters Taki and Mitsuha. We all can relate to the high school phase of our lives, it appeals to us because stories we read or watch in books or films set on characters that are going through this remind us of our own springtime of youth. Shinkai did a good job at portraying them and their relationships. My main gripe is that I feel they weren't explored enough to feel a strong sense of emotional attachment. Their lives, personalities, traits, habits, friends, lifestyles, etc are all explored in the first ~20 minutes, I personally felt that we only skimmed the surface of these characters and are forced to go further into the shallow end of a pool, only hoping that it gets deeper to actually swim around in this world of possibilities. I wanted to laugh, cry, and even relate more with the characters, but I felt that I only read about them in a story, or saw them in a film (which I did). 
I wanted to feel they could have actually existed, but the film seems to be a bit too reliant on cliche tropes to incite certain emotions. The feeling I felt is similar to seeing characters smiling and laughing with each other, and having to individually accept that this is enough to establish their inner motivations, time spent together, individual goals, etc. I felt like it wasn't enough, and just had to accept that Taki and Mitsuha were the way they were. It felt sometimes that their actions were baseless and lacking a strong motivation to be deserving of the emotion the characters poured into their actions. As if acting on a limb to do something as insane as climbing a mountain alone. I will admit that this can be disputed, however, as they are still children/teenagers, and we all do weird things for no reason growing up.
Enjoyment/Overall: 10/9
As little as I felt I delved into the personalities of the characters, I did enjoy the film a lot. Shinkai's metaphorical use of trains just continuing to go along their routes that diverge in several ways really applies in this film, as much as it did in 5 Centimeters per Second. Everyone's lives diverge in different ways, things happen in dreams and are forgotten the next day, things happen in reality and are forgotten over a lifetime. I enjoyed Taki's and Mitsuha's struggles throughout the film to help each other, and as much as it made me well up tears in my eyes, I enjoyed his questioning of how much our memories make up who we are.",9,jgaaar

Edit: I watched this at the World Premier in Los Angeles on July 3rd.  It was released in Japanese theaters on August 26th.  It is set to be streamed online (for north america) via funimation, hopefully within the next month or so.The good:
Spectacular animation.  There is one particular scene near the beginning which has a sort of ""3D camera rotation"" that looks so real that I thought it was rendered; but at the last second, the character turned their head, and I was able to tell that it had been entirely hand-drawn.  There are scenes where basic physics are completely altered, yet they managed to make it 100% smooth, dragging me along through the character's experience.
Characters.  Due to the movie format, most of the characters had very simple personalities.  The depth of the characters was sacrificed for the overarching story, ultimately leading to the main characters having deeper personalities, with the side characters left behind. Don't be confused though.  For the format, the character depth that they managed to convey was incredible.  Small hints were blended into many scenes, discretely conveying the characters' backgrounds and personalities.
Sound.  The depth of the musical score was incredible, though I will need to re-watch it with my usual headphones before committing fully.  There was not a single sound that felt out of place.  All the characters' voices suited their appearances, leading to a very immersive experience.
Story.  The story is conceptually very simple, but a lot of depth is added as the story goes on.  The show drives several important points, which can be very philosophical, without being too complicated for the average viewer to understand.  Additionally, none of the story is sacrificed in order to drive these ideas, they are inseparably blended together.
Impact.  During the show, I laughed, and I cried.  Now don't get me wrong, that's a big deal.  At the time of writing, only two other anime have made me cry.  Also, I was at the premier, and thus out in public; I certainly wasn't the only one.  Please don't approach this anime lightly.  It's truly an experience that you can never forget.
The bad:
Timing.  During the movie, there is a sequence where two characters get to know each other, which felt slightly rushed.  It could have been better to have the full experience played out, or at least pieces of it, lengthening the movie as required.
World building.  The depth of the story and characters took a toll on the world's completeness, leaving some unanswered questions.  Most characters didn't have worldviews or ideas of right vs wrong, there simply wasn't time to develop them.  Also, where the world came from, and what the ending implies for the world itself, is left unanswered.
-- I wrote this review immediately after leaving the premier.  I will continue and edit it after I have had time to process the movie's depth.",10,Builder_K
32281,"
                Makoto Shinkai's latest work goes even further to support the theory that he's fantastic at directing a visually brilliant movie, but lacks the writing ability to tell a good story.
Plot:
An absolute mess. Without spoiling it, this movie fails to get into the main plot until roughly halfway through. Before that point, it views like a teenage slice of life; nothing to be disappointed by. After the halfway mark, the plot becomes incredibly contrived with no logic, reason, or thought put into its creation.  There were at least 4 separate climaxes (which is inexcusable for any movie which is not Return of the King) and
                  an overly drawn out epilogue sequence. The main climax happens off screen, which negates the entire build up to it, because Shinkai wanted to have a reveal with little weight. There are an unacceptable amount of plotholes, mostly due to the concept of Musubi. There's little coherence, and amateur directing/writing displayed frequently throughout. To differentiate this from his other movies, Shinkai infused supernatural elements with romance, which fails horribly at enhancing the movie and instead detracts very significantly. Even amongst the people who love this movie, there is a large percentage that find the plot messy. 
Art/Animation:
It's Makoto Shinkai. If movies were judged by aesthetics alone, this would be one of the best ones. There are no issues with the art. Scene composition is mostly great, the animation was very high quality, and the art style was beautiful. While there are not as many wallpaper opportunities as in 5cm/s, the quality of them is significantly higher. Watch this in the highest possible quality you can find. Worth watching for the art alone. The animation is what you'd expect from a high budget movie, but it's not anything revolutionary. There are several scenes that move beautifully and feel like magic to look at. The animation quality isn't quite up to Ghibli standards but it is nothing to scoff at.
Sound:
Voice actors were quite good and played different roles effectively. The change in voice aesthetic was notable during the first half when they were body swapping. The soundtrack was unmemorable, but set the scene adequately, and it may help to broaden your horizons and expose you to new music. Sound FX and general background noise was well produced and sounded natural. The opening sequence song in particular stood out and is worth a listen, but I can't say that for most of the soundtrack.
Character:
The mains were adolescents, which meant there was a lot of adolescent stuff going on in the first half. The characters were interesting initially, though none stood out as incredibly well written and became less and less captivating as the movie went on. The main positive about the characters was that they mostly felt natural, save for when they were clearly not meant to. Side characters were certainly more natural than the mains, and contributed well to the atmosphere of the movie. They develop plot stupidity and have no depth or drive other than the forced romance, and plot amnesia is introduced for added gratuitous drama. There is no reason for the characters to become stupid, or amnesiacs, and it detracts from the believability of the characters and the plot.
Buy this on bluray because it looks stunning. Don't expect good characters, or a remotely good plot, but do expect to salivate at another of Shinkai's wallpaper opportunity movies. Worth the watch for the visuals. It's an awful movie that looks good.",3,Jex

                Review of ""Your Name.""
Directed, Written, and Created by Makoto Shinkai
""Your Name."" is, in a word, a journey.  A journey into what will surely be the future of cinematography, as well as a journey on a grand emotional roller coaster.
Technically speaking, labeling this film a ""masterpiece"" is an insult by omission.  Given that Shinkai is a master, anything he makes is obviously going to be a ""masterpiece,"" but among silt there is gold, and among gold there may be diamonds.  This movie is a diamond, easily the prettiest feature length film I've ever seen; more so than even fetishistic attempts to be just
                  that such as Samsara.
Feats of the cinematography include impossibly vibrant and dynamic crowds, animation that is outstanding even among his other works-nay-ESPECIALLY among his other works, match cuts that would make Kubrick jealous, impeccable blocking, usage of the golden ratio in memory of Akira Kurosawa, domicile camera work reminiscent of Yasujiro Ozu (and Tokyo Story in particular), and ellipses reminiscent of the late Satoshi Kon.  I'd also like to add that this film featured GENIUS uses of animation to do what I can only describe as Buster Keaton esque ""impossible gags"" and I am CERTAIN he must have spent many months studying the godfathers of cinema to have POSSIBLY seen the seeds for this type of genius cinematography.
Worthy of particular praise is the editing, and ESPECIALLY the sound design. Immediately, I was slammed by how immersive the atmosphere was. The music is so successfully integrated and the sound so visceral that you can't tell where your internal pace starts and where the score starts having its way with you.  As the film progresses, the movie integrates full, soulful rock songs by the Radwimps (my favorite Jrock band, btw).  Appearantly, Shinkai and the Radwimps worked together for more than 18 months as they constantly modified and worked on the audio of the film, as early back as letting the cuts and rythym of the storyboards dictate every aspect of the COMPLETELY ORIGINAL SCORE.
Make no mistake in correlating beauty and technical marvel with lack of emotional range, as this is Shinkais funniest film to date by A HUGE MARGIN, as well as the saddest, happiest, most dramatic, suspenseful, philosophical... this film is a superlative in every sense of the word.
Now, on the topic of the plot, it is not that I won't spoil the movie for you, it is that I genuinely cannot.  Much like how Inception cannot truley be summarized, this film cannot truley be summarized.  It contains complexity exceeding that which I thought truley impossible while maintaining any kind of narrative.  And it not only maintains narrative, it DRAGS you nose first on the wildest emotional journey I've ever experienced.  And it does so using an unprecedentedly real approach to subject matter too long fixtured to the perverse and otherwise absurd.  I never thought the plot device he used was even capable of being used classily, but holy CRAP I was wrong.
The story is full of foreshadowing, ""Iceburg effects"", and such personal and visceral tradgedy the likes of which I've only seen described by Shakespeare.  
The Wachowski's ""Cloud Atlas"" was a similar film to this one in a few regards (AND ONLY A FEW).  Both have unprecedented scope, the likes of which are so human and so emotionally intimate that one would think the story doomed to the uncanny valley of unsympathetic characters.  ""Your Name."" Succeeds where cloud atlas failed.  
Layers of meta narrative and copious amounts of immersive shoehorning will glue you to your seat like an unblinking tear fountain.
Before the film, Shinkai said to the audience ""I finished making this film 4 days ago"" and I believe this absolutely.  Not because the film felt rushed (because it didn't), but because I genuinely believe that there is nothing left he could have done to improve this movie in any way.

                “Kimi no Na wa.” (Your Name) opens with a radiant comet traversing over the night sky, splitting apart into various meteors that illuminate and streak the heavens. Stars and celestial imagery often feature in Makoto Shinkai’s films, and the brilliance of the opening set piece could be dismissed as eye-candy. However, its significance is not fully understood until much later.
To speak of names, one does not invoke Makoto Shinkai in conjunction with the phrase “happy ending.” To say that he has made his fame off producing romance anime is only half the story, as his work’s exploration of themes such as distance and unrequited love
                  often impart a wistful and bittersweet aftertaste. “Byousoku 5 Centimeter” (5 Centimeters per Second), his most famous title to date, is both loved and reviled for its directorial willingness to defy the sort of resolution that viewers have come to expect out of the romance genre.
While “Kimi no Na wa.” continues to incorporate motifs and concepts familiar to past Shinkai works, it reflects a maturation of his artistic vision to tell a tale of love and determination that transcends time, distance, and even apocalyptic odds.
The film centers on two characters, Mitsuha Miyamizu – a schoolgirl in rural Japan who dreams of going to the city, and Taki Tachibana, an aspiring architectural student in Tokyo. With the passing of a rare comet, the two start imagining out of body experiences in which their consciousness swaps with each other while they sleep and dream. This leads to no shortage of comedic moments, as the two characters take turns exploring and manipulating their alternate lives – and bodies. As the nature of their dreamlike, out of body experiences is revealed, the two resolve to meet each other. But in their attempt to do so, a dark truth of their relationship emerges, accelerating the story and replacing the comedic elements with a suspenseful quest to find each other and ultimately, race against time. “Kimi no Na wa.” weaves a complex, multilayered narrative that explores the struggle of human emotions against fate. You can feel Mitsuha and Taki’s determination, confusion, and desperation as they toil against temporal reality, a journey that leaves viewers equal parts thrilled and emotionally exhausted.
Makoto Shinkai reaffirms his place at the forefront of animation, as the film’s stunning backgrounds and fluid motion easily make this one of the most visually ambitious anime of the past year. Superb art direction and character designs with the assistance of Masayoshi Tanaka (AnoHana, Toradora, KokoSake) give the film a modern, colorful aesthetic.
Though some might be repelled or jaded by segments that feel like emotional manipulation – especially when considering Shinkai’s past filmography – “Kimi no Na wa.” succeeds in delivering an engrossing experience, complete with magnificent set pieces, laughs, and heart-wrenching, gripping drama. This film — the culmination of Shinkai’s skill in exploring the melancholy aspects of love and distance, is just as much a lesson on the value of finding happiness through unshakeable resolve, initiative, and overcoming doubt and hesitation.",10,TheKillerAngel

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
As of writing this review, this film is currently the highest rated anime on this site and naturally I was curious to what all the fuss was about. While this movie has absolutely amazing visuals coupled with a fantastic musical score along with great directing by Makoto Shinkai, unfortunately, the script and characters, in my eyes, could have been a lot better.
The narrative of this film centres around our two protagonists; Mitsuha, who lives in a rural part of Japan who is bored of her everyday life and wishes to live in Tokyo and Taki who, well...lives in Tokyo. There is literally
                  nothing else that defines this character at all. One day they begin to switch bodies and live out each other's lives for short periods of time at regular intervals. Why this exactly happens is never explained to us at all and feels more like a plot convenience than any other supernatural or spiritual event of some kind.
The first half of the film plays out like your typical high school comedy and while this concept of a girl and boy switching bodies is not entirely original it still comes across as fun. Easily my favorite part of this film are the scenes in which we see how each of these characters affects each other's life and the consequences that arise as a result of this. The scenes in which they were instructing each other on what not to do when they're in each other's bodies, comes across as smart and funny and I was interested in a concept of how each person could have made one another appreciate their life more, or help to improve their life in some way. But that's all we really get as a whole. The characterisation and characters themselves felt a little weak and dry too but, despite all that, the first half is somewhat enjoyable and fun all the way through.
However, where I really being to lose interest is during the second half and this is where it becomes more apparent that the film is trying to ride on its own conveniences a little too much. For starters, the love that we're supposed to buy into, for me at least, came across as forced and boring. The two characters begin to muster feelings for each other and it comes across as superficial since they've barely even spoken in real life to each other and every time they do, they forget about each other immediately afterwards. Despite a massive threat of death looming over these characters, I simply didn't care since I was so uninterested in all of them since the film never gave me any reason to care from the start. None of the characters are barely developed and Taki especially has hardly any personality to speak of so it becomes hard to attach yourself onto him or to care for his struggles in the least.
When the film began to introduce time and amnesia into the mix, it felt like a cluster of ideas and themes that never really fit together nor played out in a satisfying way. A lot of the time the story felt way too convenient and some of the plot devices felt kind of lazy. To me, the fact that everyone was evacuated before the comet hit OFF screen felt really lazy and that scene could have been fantastic character development for Mitsuha as she would of had to finally confront her father and we could learn more about their relationship. I can perhaps understand that the writer may have wanted to create some suspense for the audience by leaving it ambiguous as to weather or not they escaped but since we find out only three minutes later it seems kind of pointless in retrospect. Some characters I felt were a waste of time and didn't really add anything to the overall plot. Miki could have been removed from the plot entirely and it wouldn't have made much difference. I feel as if the final shot could have been much more powerful if I had cared about these characters at all during the duration of the film
Now the film does do a good job in the FEEELS not because it was derivative of the characters (which it should be to feel a greater sense of urgency during the climax) but because of the beautiful animation and framing. Every frame looks amazing especially during the more emotionally heavy scenes and, as I said before, the directing for this film is fantastic. The frames are well detailed with high levels of movement and the music does a fantastic job at immersing you in its world. I can appreciate all of the effort that went into the technical side of this anime which is why it pains me to see the plot and characters being presented in such a weak way.
All in all, if you're able to look past the flaws in the script the film is highly enjoyable and it doesn't take too much to feel the emotion they try to convey through the cinematography. Just turn your brain off and enjoy the great visuals and the music.",4,LIQfilms

                ""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS""
THE AUTHOR-Makoto Shinkai who is regarded as one of the finest  director of recent time and with works likes ""Hoshi no Koe"" ""GOW"" ""5CMPS"" under his belt,there is no doubt about the caliber of this man.
His majority of works relies mainly on the visual effect where each frame speak a word for itself,the tension he creates between the characters,the emotion he depicts with that and overall execution which even makes a simplest of the story somewhat extraordinary to watch.
I really find myself fond of those  and following Shinkai over the years,I realised that plot-based work is never his strong point
                  and when I heard that ""Kimi no Na Wa"" is a full-length film,I didn't felt much confident about it but the internet made me crazy overnight,reading the reviews of numerous self-made critics and  the comments over social networking site,it feed my desire more and more to watch the film and at one point I was like even if I stumble upon a black and white 60P print,I would take it without any hesitation but fortunately I got better than that and I was prepared to ride on the feel train but my experience were utterly different from what I imagine to be.
STORY- First of all the plot isn't original, to begin with,I could relate a lot of work that gives close resemblance.
Let's start with ""Ditto"" a Korean film where two people living twenty-one years apart in time able to contact each other through radio or ""Lake House"" an American film with the same concept but the time difference is two years and mean of communication is through letters.
Bringing another work to notice, 'It's a Boy Girl Thing"" Where two individuals swapped bodies, adapted to their surroundings, and over time fall in love.
How does it sound?
Finally mixed it up with Japanese settings and some unexplainable science fiction stuff, here comes the idea of the masterminded plot for ""Kimi no na wa""
GOING IN-DEPTH-
Anyway, the introductory couple of minutes will give you the vibe of ""5CMPS"" two distinctive individuals who're always searching something meaningful in their life which they have lost but can't recall, they don't know what trigger the feelings but it initiated since the faithful day when the star passed by.
[A good impression]
>
Then it went back to flashback,Mitsuha (the main female lead) a countryside girl and Taki (the main male lead) a boy living in modern Tokyo two completely strangers to each other, started swapping body in dreams and despite the fact that they were from totally different places,they started adapting to the surroundings over time and even made some rule so that it won't hurt their daily life.
It was really intriguing to watch how Mitsuha in Taki's body made a girl fall for him,the breast groping scenes,the cameo of Yukino from 'GOW"",learning about fascinating culture ,I could say that this was probably the only entertaining part of the whole story but there are a lot of things that can't be outlook.
[First of all;nobody knows what caused them to swap even seem like the author didn't and secondly,it's surprising that they didn't try to contact each other for real,they didn't notice the date nor tried to talk about it clearly,probably for the sake of the plot to take an interesting turn]
>
After spending quality times in each other bodies , finally they stopped swapping and now Taki wants to call him for real but not able to reach her over cell phone,he decided to visit her for real on the rough presumption sketch he made from his memories only to find out later than the place is destroyed by a meteor three years back and she died.
He realized that the Mitsuha he swapped bodies with was three years in the past ,even she came to see him once but he didn't recognize her because of the timeline difference and that's the time she gave him the ""braided cord"".
Now he went to underground (the place where the body of the shrine god was supposed to be) here comes one of the stupidest illogical plot twist ever with no explanation at all,he drank the kuchikami sake (The sake that Mitsuha made three years by chewing ,spitting and fermenting the rice )
and magically it took him to the past by mean of body swapping to alter it,he was able to experience Mitsuha's past as well,For the success of the story you need to have a sad past of a character and here's no different with it,a two minutes recap of her life with gorgeous animation.
>
Now when Taki is back to the past in her body,how would he react is such despair moment?how would he save countless people from the verge of dying?
*GROPE THE BREAST AND FEEL IT*
*USE THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP TO CONVINCE YOUR ONE FRIEND TO BLOW THE POWER PLANT AND ANOTHER TO FAKE REPORT OVER MIC TO EVACUATE PEOPLE*
Sounds so realistic,right?
Next what'll about to happen will sound more realistic than ever,Mitsuha back in senses in Taki's body was extremely surprised but then Taki in Mitusha's body went there after making all the preparation and despite the timeline difference an unexplainable phenomenon happen,they were finally able to see each other and what's the first thing she said to him?
""You pervert you drink that,your grope my breast several times""
Such conversation makes me go WOW.
Now, in short, they were able to share a just little moment until disappearing to their respective timeline and somehow this cause them forget about the memories they had.
Before that,taki wrote that he love her in her hand instead of writing his name because that is ""SWAG""
Back to his timeline and having another chance,she miracle able to convince the villagers and her dad to evacuate,again we didn't know how she did it.
It's like you know the outcome of the equation but not the steps,anyway they were saved and Five years have passed since then for taki and eight years for Mitsuha,now both of them live in Tokyo,they passed each other on several occasion but never been a moment where they recognize each other until the train sequence,wasn't that predictable from beginning?
It's unlikely from Shinkai to give an ending like this but for a change,he did it and another reason that made this work mainstream.
*ALRIGHT*
SUMMING UP ALL THE POINTS-
(*) Promising start,entertaining to watch but nothing explain why they were swapping,they didn't even check the dates nor contacted each other for real,you didn't even care to look for the place where the girl is in neither the girl care to look for the boy.
Plot convenience.
(*)A strange girl gave you braided cord in train and you don't even know her,why care to keep it for three years?Plot convenience.
(*)The relationship between the main characters were so vague,I know this is Shinkai's usual style but for a change I thought he'll give us something more but it turn out another cliche romance,I wonder if the use of word ""romance"" is right or not.
Neither of them knows each other for real,just share the empty shell and experience each other lifestyle,suddenly feeling started to burst out from where?
WOW.
(*)The way he time travel back to save her,the way he convinced the friends in her bodies,the final execution to evacuate the village all feel so foolish and out of the line.
(*)confusion of different timeline-
It's the most complicated part,Mitsuha's timeline was parallel to Taki's timeline of three years ago,she eventually died over there.
But the taki that had the body swapping and all the interaction with her is the one in the future three years ahead,so when he realized that he fall in despair and tried one last time to change the past and he succeeds in the most unrealistic way ever,anyway the thing is that what happen to two different timelines,did they merge or separated?we never got an explanation of that,it's like thing happens so let move on and observe the emotion not the logic behind it.
If we bring the first couple of minutes in the film,we get a clear image what trigger the emptiness inside them,the feeling of missing something important in their life,it was since the day meteor pass by.
-Taki in the current timeline never had the feeling before he interacted with her and even he had no knowledge of the meteor and stuff,he wakes up with vague memories in the mountain after the effort to save her whereas taki's of the different timeline was shown to have all the knowledge of the incident and even had the empty feeling ever since that day.
For mitsuha,she might have more reference to what happen as in the ending,when taki asked her ""if they ever met"",the way mitsuha reacted to give a good idea of that.
The emotions aspect can never overshadow such part.
****************************************************
CHARACTERS - There's an interesting perspective on representing the characters,on one hand, there is depiction of rural lifestyle where life moves more slowly and people are bound together by strong relation and the fact that Mitsuha is a countryside girl, she's bound by familial responsibility and inclined to hold on to stability with everything she has but sometimes,she wants to go out of boundary and explore outside world, on the other hand,Taki is from urban area and people over here lives in exactly opposite fashion,taki has been presented as a normal high school guy who's living a regular like,just like you,me or anyone else.
Their friends, families and surroundings are totally dissimilar and Shinkai have done quite well creating a barrier and exposing us to two different atmospheres but I felt like there was a  lack of character development.
MUSIC -It won't be wrong to call it as a partial musical film.
We can't deny the fact that each OST is done brilliantly and goes with the flow perfectly, never heard of the band ""RADWIMPS"" before, but they did some extraordinary job with the music and surely deserve all the praise.
Sometimes it felt like each song was made for each sequence.
ANIMATION-I didn't have the opportunity to experience the visual effects to the fullest extent nor more than 85% voters over here but from what I experience, I can pretty much say that this surpasses even ""GOW"" and you've to give credit to ""CoMix Wave Films"",they have been loyal to Shinkai since the beginning of his career and with each project such improvement, unbelievable and the only one they compete with is themselves, there have lots of scenes which have even executed so beautifully that you can find deeper meanings within it.
ENJOYMENT- I got a mixed feeling about this,I thought it'll make me laugh,cry and would be a whole different experience for me,I did enjoy in the in the first half but as soon it progresses,It felt like the plot was trying too hard and with all those illogical stuff going on.
OVERALL -The story wasn't anything special, we can say pretty much mediocre, there were many moments that felt unrealistic and even lots
questions were left unanswered, despite that it has been well-executed
along with the music and animation, which somewhat make it enjoyable to watch but it's no near ""Perfect"" and just above average.",7,R_TF

                Fair warning: this review contains MAJOR spoilers of basically the entire movie. First off, it's a movie that has taken people by storm, so I'm sure that if you want to watch it, you already have by now. If that's not the case, I recommend you exit off of this review immediately. You've been warned.
With that out of the way, assuming that since you're still reading, I assume you've already seen the movie or don't mind being spoiled. Either way, I just wanted to let you know the reason why I'm writing a review filled with spoilers. Basically, Kimi no Na wa isn't a movie
                  where the quality remains consistent from start to finish. It starts off pretty good but ends bad. To completely justify why I rate it the way I do, I need to analyze the entire movie. So, with that out of the way, I'll now begin.
There comes a point where anime becomes so highly praised among the anime community to the point where it becomes unavoidable, though this isn't ALWAYS in a good way. Sometimes, things are popular just because they fit a specific audience that enjoys the things present within the series, despite potentially bad writing (SAO is a good example for that). That's really how it is with just about any ""shut your brain off and watch the fights"" action series... people care more about what's seen and less about the substance, thus poor writing is excused because everything looks cool.
I've always thought of the company behind a lot of well-known visual novels, Key, is similar to what I've stated above, though with more dramatic works as opposed to action-filled ones. They write very tear-jerking stories that border on the line of being melodramatic, and bundle them together with a lot of pretentious plotlines and themes and fantastic art+a great soundtrack, all things that allow people to completely avoid the fact that the writing isn't all that great and just enjoy the way it's all presented. And to me, Makoto Shinkai, the writer and creator of various other anime films including the one I'm reviewing right now, is like the Key of the anime world.
Kimi no Na wa isn't QUITE the same in the regard that I listed above, but I do think it's on the same boat in its own way. As opposed to being very popular, whether for good or bad reasons, what this film has done is jump almost instantly to the top of the MAL ratings, which makes it nearly unavoidable in its own way because you begin to think, ""what is it that makes it so good? Why are people so in love with it?"" That's what caused me to watch it, and I was left severely disappointed. Here's my reasons why.
The movie starts off as a typical school comedy with very typical characters that seem like they're not meant to have any definition or substance to them, which is okay as long as the writing remains consistent and doesn't try to take itself too far (unfortunately that isn't the case). The movie reminds me a lot of Kokoro Connect, with a boy and a girl occasionally switching bodies at unknown times and trying to adjust to their new lifestyles. The cause of this new phenomenon is never given.
This was one of my very first problems with the movie. The setting is within a fictional world, but that doesn't excuse plot convenience. Stories CAN include fictional things that don't exist in the real world, things like giant robots, or monsters, inhabiting another planet. Things like that are okay, because they're meant to be fictional, and their worth as a story is presented in the very beginning. But, with Kimi no Na wa? The film tries to set itself up in a realistic world, where everything is normal like our own but... this strange thing happens between these two people. In situations like that, explanation needs to be done. Why it's happening, why it's only between these two people, things like that. Even horrible explanation, such as saying, ""a loop in space and the fact that they met on this day at this time at this spot,"" or something like that, would be far better than no explanation at all. All it does is show why you shouldn't be too pretentious when writing fiction. Very poor writing right there.
However, the first half really isn't all that bad, simply because it's something you can stop thinking about completely and just enjoy it for what it is. A lot of stuff made no sense, but it was still fun to see how each person was affecting each other's life and how they dealt with it. It was still kind of hard to not catch some of the problems, such as how they adapted to the entire situation so easily and even went along with how the other was affecting their life without a whole lot of trying to stop them. Regardless, it was still fun for the most part, something I'd view in similar light as a typical school comedy/slice of life with a small twist... rating it around 7/10 and considering it a very safe watch if you're looking for a way to comfortably pass the time.
The second half comes along and it's where all of the problems of the film begin to show. More mishaps occur that make you realize that the film trying to take place in a realistic world similar to ours is complete bullshit. They don't just switch bodies, they also travel in time. They never realized this because it seems people don't talk about current events in each timeline. It seems calendars or phones/computers with dates on them don't exist either. Many things that make you think it SHOULD take place in a fantasy world, but it doesn't because that would require a completely different style of writing. The entire second half just stops making sense.
One character actually tries to take the initiative to meet the other person in real life, which is something that is supposed to seem out of the ordinary simply because, for whatever reason, they never attempt to talk to each other in real life besides through notes they leave during the times that they switch bodies. I've heard some people around the anime community try to dismiss this with ""they thought it was all a dream,"" but there's absolutely no way that that's possible because their lives were affected by it and they understand that fully. So go ahead and completely dismiss that idea of yours if you were one of the people who have it because it's completely impossible.
Regardless, the girl does finally take the initiave to meet the guy, but the fact that they're in different timelines is almost instantly seen as a problem, thus the guy has no idea who the girl is. And for WHATEVER reason, the girl doesn't question this at ALL! She pretty much just accepts it, with hardly any struggle. Not asking the guy if he's had any strange dreams recently, nothing. She doesn't even think for a second to wonder, ""why doesn't he know who I am?"" Even though, if she DID think that way, she'd realize that something's wrong and might even be able to figure out what's going on.
However, all of that is thrown away when actual time travel happens. After they managed to meet physically on a train, which was the situation I described above, they eventually meet again in spirit form thanks to the power of plot convenience. Neither meeting affected the plot at all, all it did was gave the audience a potential pairing to ship together even though they had no face-to-face contact that they didn't end up forgetting about shortly after. Gotta love amnesia being used as a plot device.
Yeah, this film doesn't shy from using amnesia as well. Whenever the two speak to each other, or share messages, or anything, it's almost instantly afterwards that they forget about it. They're left with a lingering feeling of ""I feel like I'm missing something"" but they still fail to remember anything in the end. This is all because of plot convenience, because it allows the plot to continue on for far longer than it really needs to.
Eventually, the characters are trying to affect history, which is to prevent the deaths of people caused by a natural disaster. As if enough amnesia hadn't been used between the character interactions alone, the boy forgets completely about this natural disaster, like it wasn't important enough for him to remember or how he's somehow never heard of it despite it being one of the most tragic natural disasters in recorded history. They attempt to pass this over as ""he's been traveling through time and doesn't remember everything that hasn't happened yet in the current timeline"" but that's complete bullshit as well. That has NEVER been a theme in any sort of story related to time travel; that's just not how it works. It's time travel because you visit times you haven't been to, or were once in in the past, while keeping all of your current knowledge. Otherwise, you're just visiting another spot on the timeline; that's not actual time travel, that's time jumping. And even with all of that said, it's still bullshit simply because the guy DOES retain some knowledge throughout the various timelines, the most notable one being that he remembers that he's there to save someone. It's all just selective memory, all for the sake of plot convenience.
Everything is saved because the girl manages to convince her own father to evacuate the people in time. This is another form of plot convenience, similar to the one pointed out above. She remembers perfectly that a disaster is coming and even has an extensive plan to prevent it from killing all of the people that it did in a different timeline, but doesn't at ALL remember how she knows that the disaster is incoming? How does that make any sense whatsoever? And the girl convincing her father to evacuate all of those people? It all happens OFF SCREEN. Why? Because there's no way it could be shown in a way that makes ANY sense, because it's such an absurd thing from the viewpoints of the entire village. The girl's original plan to cut off all of the electricity with a bomb and make everyone believe that a terrorist attack is incoming, despite it also being stupid, actually made a lot more sense and if that would've been used as the method to evacuate everyone and save all the lives they did, then okay. Stupid, but it would've worked a lot better. But, that's too simple, and would've ended the film too quickly, so we just have to stretch everything super far until it doesn't make any sense. Doing things the Makoto Shinkai way.
The tragedy is prevented and somehow, no time paradox is caused even though literally hundreds of people who should be dead in the current timeline are still alive. Life continues on as it normally would for the guy and nothing changes for him into the future. After an unspecified number of years later, the two of them meet again by pure accident and it's implied that they end up remembering everything, since the movie is ended with, ""do I know you?"" All thanks to the power of nonsense and plot convenience. And bullshit.
The movie is a perfect example of exploiting every single type of lazy plot convenience that exists out there as opposed to actual good writing, but that's all forgotten about because it's animated well in order to maximize the amount of feels you get without having even a small hint of good writing or logic. You're expected to forget what's going on and instead view everything like you would a show with a laugh track. Enjoy the amazing art, laugh, cry, and not give a single shit about the actual quality of writing. Kimi no Na wa is yet another example of how bad a majority of modern anime are. Tons of plot conveniences; time resets, amnesia, all without any explaining.
Imagine a gift box, wrapped up very nicely with tons of bows and ribbons with a tag that says it's to you from the most important person in your life, or the biggest crush you have, or whoever you'd most want a present from. But you open it up, and it's completely empty. That's basically what Kimi no Na wa is. A pretty box with nothing in it. Something that looks nice but has no substance.
In short, Kimi no Na wa is a film that looks amazing, sounds even better, but fails in so many other regards. The story isn't that bad at the beginning because it plays off like a comfortable time killer with only a few issues outside of the actual series composition. However, during the second half, everything turns to an absolute shitfest of plot convenience and nonsense. The characters throughout the entire movie are extremely one-dimensional, as they're simply just horribly characterized AND developed, which during the first half really doesn't matter but it's definitely a problem in the second half. Overall, Kimi no Na wa is simply just a failure of a film, only saved by great presentation and how comfortable and safe of a watch it was during the first half, and the first half ALONE.
Given how sick I am of talking about this series, the only recommendations I'm going to give are extremely obvious and extremely lazy: 5 Centimeters per Second, Garden of Words, Children who Chase Lost Voices, and The Place Promised in Our Early Days. They're all of Makoto Shinkai's other full-feature film works, and they all follow very similar story structure and overall film composition that I'm sure you'll like them if you're one of the many Kimi no Na wa fanboys out there. Outside of those obvious recommendations, I have nothing that I'm gonna attempt to offer you as of right now; maybe I'll edit my review one day and add some actual unique recommendations of series' that do what Shinkai tries but ultimately fails to do.

                Before watching this movie, I must say I was pretty hyped as lots of my friends recommended it and it took the #1 spot on MAL. However, I have to admit I am quite disappointed in the end and here's why:
*Spoilers Alert*
Story: 3/10
The first half of the movie is about typical high school boy living in Tokyo swapping body with a countryside girl with a boring-ass life dreaming to go to Tokyo someday. There's a bit of comedy here and there but nothing impressive so far and quite boring to be honest. But then comes the second half, it turned out the main heroine already
                  died years earlier which is why the boy could not find her or call her and then warned her to avoid the cataclysm. At this point I suddenly realized the plot is way too similar to a movie called ""The Lake House"" and obviously I'm quite disappointed with the lack of originality of the story. 
Art & Sound: 7/10 & 8/10
Honestly, the music is the only saving point for this movie. For the art, all I can say about the art is adequate, nothing more nothing less. 
Characters: 4/10
Nothing much to say about the characters. That's how generic I think the characters are. This movie focuses only on these two students so surely some in-depth background for the characters should be provided right?
Overall I'm not saying this movie is utter rubbish, but its definitely not a masterpiece either and it's definitely not a movie which deserves to be on the top spot especially with the lack of originality of the story. What surprises me the most is that some people realized this and still giving it a 10/10. I definitely won't recommend this to anyone unless you want an anime similar to The Lake House, well here you go!",5,Zephariel

                	Ever since I was a child, I wanted to be an author. I’d write for days on end, using every ounce of my imagination, and then stored my works away in some secret drawer when I finished. Frightened to death of sneers and condescending laughter, I rarely shared my writings with anyone, only submitting them to a contest or two over the years. A couple of months ago, I heard that there was going to be a prestigious writer’s conference, known as Books Alive, in my town, where literary agents would search high and low for the next great author. Despite having a small amount
                  of time to prepare, I pushed aside my fears and toiled furiously on a brief sample for a murder mystery that I was planning to write (you can read it at the end of my review). On the day of the conference, I approached one of the most famous agents there and, with a stutter and shaking hands, I presented my sample to the agent. She thoughtfully looked over what I had and, with as much grace as she could, turned me down. Before advising me to come back next year, she complimented my writing skills but said that I was too focused on establishing the setting rather than developing the characters in it.
That, my friends, is Your Name in a nutshell.
	I thought that, after the disaster known as Erased, the good people of MyAnimeList would be more selective in what they label “great”, more reluctant to flock to whatever’s the biggest and brightest. I, of course, was wrong. Your Name, in no time at all, skyrocketed to the first spot on MAL’s Top Anime, and this fact is depressing. Apparently, anything that happens to look fantastic, and has a combination of time travel and “feelz” is automatically adored by the masses. Looking from afar, I thought there has to be more to this film than what’s on the surface. There has to be a reason why Makoto Shinkai, the director of Your Name, is hailed as “the next Miyazaki”. This is why I decided to watch Your Name and the result?
Well…….
	The first few minutes are a work of art, with the story shifting the perspective back and forth from one character to the other, and the gorgeous animation overwhelming your eyeballs. If there’s one thing that I’ll remember about Your Name, it’s that this film is scenery porn at its finest. The cinematography won’t exactly captivate you but practically every frame in this work is shot with an impeccable eye for detail, making sure the smallest pieces of the environment don’t go unnoticed. It is this specialty that shines in Your Name’s greatest scene, where the protagonist scurries into a cave, running form the cold, constant, and unforgiving rain (It’s simply a beautiful sequence to witness). When it comes to camerawork, Erased clearly soars beyond the likes of Your Name. However, in a contest to smother the audience with its looks, this film is unrivaled.
	Of course, just because something looks great doesn’t qualify it as the Citizen Kane of anime unless it has something beneath the glitz and glamour. You need something substantial that can provide a foundation for your film, like a quality cast of characters, and Your Name just doesn’t have it. Now, before you start dubbing me a hater, just wait – wait! – a second. Below, I have three requirements that I think a show should meet in order to have a quality cast.
1.	Does the personality of the protagonists change at all?
2.	Do the protagonists stand out?
3.	Does the supporting cast matter?
These requirements aren’t long-winded or multi-faceted, and yet there’s no way you can tell me that Your Name meets any of them.
1 and 2. Taki and Mitsuha are our walking clichés of the day. There is no difference in who they are from start to finish. There isn’t one trait about either one of them that would make you remember them at all. I will give you a million dollars if you can prove me wrong on this one.
(Before I type any further, I want to talk about amnesia for a sec. It’s been the quintessential plot convenience device since, like, forever; while some writers were able to use amnesia in a realistic and convincing fashion, it has often required a copious amount of suspension of disbelief to make it work but here it borders on ridiculousness. Let’s say I met someone I haven’t seen in a while. We talk and then that person walks away. You seriously can’t expect me to FORGET THAT PERSON’S NAME A MINUTE LATER, right? Moving on…..)
3.	Ummm, let’s see, there’s that one guy with a crush on Mitsuha, that restaurant chick with the torn dress, and Mitsuha’s family: her dad, sister, and grandma. Not one of them is someone you’d regard as memorable or important, and I just can’t understand for the life of me how that’s forgivable (Well, the grandma does have a pretty solid knowledge of what’s occurring in the plot).
“Character flaws, huh? You might have a point ther- OH MY GAWD THOSE STARS ARE SO PWETTY!”
	To be completely honest, I became really bored when the animation ceased to amaze. The romance isn’t funny or interesting in the slightest. The characters are dull and boring. The plot is horrendously slow and uninspiring. This is what I thought while about to fall asleep…… and then the plot twist happened. It slammed into me like a sack of bricks, instantly breathing life into something that was on the verge of becoming forgettable. For those of you that weren’t half-conscious while watching Your Name, you might’ve seen the twist coming. For me, however, as soon as I saw the words “three years ago” at the bottom of the screen, I thought that the film was about to justify the hype. Instead of putting their heads together to create a finale for the ages, Your Name’s writers collectively shrugged their shoulders and settled for the cop-out of cop-outs: true love conquers all.
**and now for the writing sample that I promised to show you in the first paragraph**
	Drenched in the all-consuming blanket of rain, leaning over the bridge’s rust-speckled rail, Don exhaled the whispery dark gray smoke that hailed from his wiry thin Newport cigarette, his fifth of the day. Don gazed thoughtfully at his reflection that appeared on the surface of the town’s heavily-polluted river, a mixture of juniper green and the darkest brown from the steady flow of the chemical waste from the most environmentally ignorant factories. Bystanders rushed to and fro, this way and that, attempting to escape the oppressive downpour of the sky’s sadness. Not Don. With the utmost carefulness, he ever so slowly rotated away from peering into the river; with his back and elbows resting on the rail, he observed them in their futile war against the natural elements. Attempting an informal method of saluting their efforts, Don’s hand scoured through his thoroughly soaked pocket before clenching an ancient but capable lighter. The hand glided out of Don’s pocket with the lighter in its clutches before illuminating the previously extinguished butt of the Newport that slouched limply on the private eye’s mouth. As the fire burned bright, Don was ready to inhale the remaining contents of the already-used cigarette when a particularly vicious gust of the chilly midmorning wind snuffed out the Newport’s flame. With an empathetic shrug of the shoulders, Don allowed the Newport to float gracefully from his lips onto the ground, where he boredly drilled the heel of his penny loafer into the cigarette and stirred from his position on the rail. “Stop trying to show off your writing skills already and let me get my work done,” grumbled Don. As bystanders panicked, running to and fro, this way and that, attempting to retreat from their war with nature into a secure building to rest, Don effortlessly strode slouching, his hands jammed in his dampened pockets, through the crowd. Then, the private eye was gone.
*Before you go, allow me to give you a few final words on Your Name*
	It wasn’t the top-tier animation that made Hayao Miyazaki a household name. It was the combination of childhood nostalgia and an innocent sense of adventure in his films that elevated his success. It was the ability to include an array of social statements and dark elements to movies made for children without coming across as pretentious. More than anything else, it’s the feeling that you witnessed something special that established Miyazaki as a legend. Someday, I’ll be 90 years old, peeing on myself and losing my memory, but I’ll still recall the impact Miyazaki’s films had on me. Obviously, Your Name doesn’t contain that appeal. As soon as the anime community realizes this, they’ll move on from this film and idolize yet another time travel rom-com/tragedy with great animation and glaring flaws. It won’t be next week or next month but it will definitely be soon. When the time comes, there will be others like me, who scratch their heads in confusion and ask, “Wait, we’re doing this again?”
One of these days, MyAnimeList will get it right.",6,bmoore07

                With ""Your Name"" storming up to MAL's top, I had to check it out for myself and experience this phenomenon, that has a score of 9,40 out of 10 at the time of writing. 
With so many people agreeing, that it's a masterpiece, it has to be good, right? Well turns out I didn't enjoy it quite as much the majority of MAL users.
Plot:
The story starts fair enough. Our main character suffers from ""Disney princess syndrome""; she's not satisfied with the surroundings she was born in and wants to see the world, that is so much bigger than what she knows. Luckily for her, magical
                  realism is a thing in her world as well. Out of nowhere she gets the chance to live out her dreams by switching bodies with a boy from Tokyo every now and then. The boy, turns out to be the other main character. This sounds like the basic story, in which our lead learns, that ""every place is beautiful, but home is still best"" or that everybody has troubles in their life, no matter where they come from. The set up definetly has some potential, since the main characters parallel each other in an interesting way and they're pretty well characterized. 
But that doesn't turn out to be the case with ""Your Name"". The writer was far more ambitious than to just recycle the classic body switch plot. About halfway the movie switches into a pretty convoluted romance story, that just doesn't work, because the whole second half is built around wanting to give the audience the ""feels"". Don't get me wrong, I like a good romance or a good tragedy as much as anyone else, but if it all feels as contrived and transparent as in this movie's case, I won't be able to jump on the feel train.
The climax was a pretty interesting idea, but was pretty inconsistently build up, where things worked out way too conveniently to be believable.
Characters:
I've already addressed it in the previous section, that I found the characterization of the characters pretty good. With the exception of the self-absorbed and ambitious father almost all felt pretty lively. Unfortunately characters can at time's be only as good as the plot allows them to be. This shows especially with the side characters, who at times just conveniently join into the plot, even if it doesn't make much sense. Same goes for our leads, they're pretty fun at first, but as soon as the plot starts becoming contrived and convoluted, I no longer found them as likeable.
Art:
The art and animation were pretty good, but it was pretty standard in terms of style.
Sound:
Just like the plot the sound was also heavy into making you feel stuff and to be fair it did resonate with me somewhat. Interestingly there were alot of pop songs instead of the more typical choice of instrumentals. 
Plot:            50% (4/10)
Characters: 30% (6/10)
Art:              10% (8/10)

                 Makoto Shinkai never fails to frustrate me. His works have tremendous potential, yet they all inevitably end up as shallow exercises in romantic drama that are pretty to look at and not much else. With the release of Kimi no Na wa. I was very skeptical if any of that had changed. It released to the top of multiple anime lists seemingly over night and I figured it would be 5 Centimeters Per Second 2.0, but maybe, just maybe, Shinkai would break away from his old patterns and surprise me. 
Spoilers, he didn't. 
 Kimi no Na Wa. tells the story of a girl
                  and boy who mysteriously switch bodies and have to learn how to deal with being each other… or not. 
 If anyone is expecting Kimi no Na wa. to stray away from Shinkai’s typical formula they will be sorely disappointed. All of his usual angst ridden longing relationship drama is on display here, including copious amounts of scenery porn, sad piano music, dramatic running scenes, and even love murdering trains. I suppose this also means that anyone who likes his other works will probably enjoy this one as well for the exact reason that it isn't very different. For everyone else however, Kimi no Na Wa. is painfully predictable and lacking.
 My favorite part about Kimi no Na wa. is the body swapping concept which creates some fun and humorous situations. The story is at its best during the scenes that show how the main characters handle situations while having their bodies swapped which leads to some awkward, funny, and genuinely charming moments. Unfortunately we don't get much of this after the beginning of the movie and what is the best part of the story goes underutilized in favor of Shinkai’s typical routine. 
 As much as l like the whole body swapping concept I feel it is poorly explained as are the mystical elements of the story. It literally comes down to some kind of magical spit wine, shooting stars, time traveling yarn, and/or some family bloodline thing, all of which are equally obtuse. Generally I hate time travel in any story, it just makes things needlessly convoluted and silly. Kimi no Na wa. is no different but I guess it’s not as ridiculous as the Terminator series. Overall I find that simpler explanations (or any at all) for the mystical elements would have benefited the story.   
 Pacing is also an issue in Kimi no Na wa.. Though it is less noticeable here than it is in other Shinkai works it is still apparent especially towards the end of the movie. There is a dramatic running sequence which feels like an eternity followed by an awkward time skip and more running before finally reaching the credits. A bit of streamlining and polish could have greatly improved the entire ending.  
 One positive difference in Kimi no Na wa. is that the main characters are a lot more interesting compared to Shinkai’s other works with the small but meaningful glimpses we are given into their lives. That said there are some weird decisions that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. The female protagonist, Mitsuha, has an issue with her father and being bullied and both are resolved in an unsatisfying manner. The bullying seems to be taken care of by the male protagonist, Taki, kicking over a desk while in her body thus scaring the bullies off? I suppose this isn't too big of a deal since the bullying was not a huge part of her story but that just makes the decision to even introduce it to begin with an odd one. The issue with the dad is another thing entirely though, as this is built up throughout the story only to be solved by Mitsuha being more affirmative in a confrontation towards the end of the movie that takes place almost entirely off screen which is as disappointing as it sounds. 
 The side characters seemed like they could be interesting but we don’t get much of them. Taki’s boss Miki gets some screen time but this is mostly just to build the romance with him and Mitsuha more than anything. Even the date scene ends kind of abruptly with Miki saying that he seems more interested in somebody else and just leaving. This however is enough for her to accompany him and his other friend on some journey to find a dead girl. 
 It goes without saying that every Shinkai work is visually spectacular and Kimi no Na wa. is no different. Though I can't say I find the scenery porn as appealing as his other works it's just as impressive as the rest. Music is mostly soft atmospheric pieces and though nothing really stands out it works fine. All in all everything is very pretty and I can't complain.
 Unfortunately Kimi no Na wa. is just an average film in a long line of average films with Shinkai’s name attached. There’s nothing new or special, other than Shinkai's foot fetish being traded in for a spit drinking fetish. He still is a one trick pony when it comes to storytelling which is a shame because Children Who Chase Lost Voices shows that he is capable of something that is at least a little bit different. Maybe one day Shinkai will surprise and impress me (probably not) but as of now he just lacks the tact and subtly of better directors. I guess he can always do commission work drawing feet if times get rough though.",4,Shrabster

Every story has a skeletal structure, a beginning, middle, and end. We all know this. Makoto Shinkai films also have a structure to their story. Just that they’re all the same. 
Beginning: I love you. 
Middle: I can’t stay with you forever. 
End: I hope we see each other again. 
You may be asking: With such a basic structure, how can any of his films be so successful? It’s all about the flesh.
                  You don’t see someone’s skeleton, but if you actually try and think about the story, you really can see this structure. Criticisms aside, however, there is another thing that always happens in Shinkai films: Frickin’ incredible artwork. This show was no exception when it came to beautifully detailed backgrounds, natural scenes, and characters.
Of course, the soundtrack was also nice, performed by Radwimps. Personally, watching it in the theatre was a bit overwhelming, but the songs were great individually, and I thought that most of them played their role as part of the film. 
These two factors (artwork and soundtrack) really cover up the basic story, and make it a beautiful film to sit and watch. But nothing more than that. It’s just eye candy. The rating 10 means masterpiece. A masterpiece has a well thought out story, and highly developed characters to execute it (at the very least, this would be a standard way of forming a masterpiece, there can be exceptions through extraordinary uniqueness, etc…). 
—which now takes us to characters.We have the two main characters, Mitsuha and Taki. First spoiler incoming (not too much of a spoiler but…): in the story, Mitsuha and Taki switch bodies while they dream. Second spoiler: They end up falling in love. Okay, so they know each other because the switch bodies, but they never switch characters, they always remain themselves, just with a different body. In other words, they’re falling in love with someone who’s personality they actually know nothing about—I think that tells you enough about the depth of these characters (笑). But jokes aside, if I were to give you a description of these two, I would ask you to imagine incredibly normal high schoolers (the girl being a bit cute, and the guy being a bit handsome), and give them a super effective love potion that makes them want to see each other no matter what. That’s about the level of development we see. 
Despite all said, Shinkai films never fail to at least seem heartfelt to me. It may be that since the structure of his stories are so simple, they feel relatable at the same time, and extremely real. I’d be pretty reluctant to give this film a masterpiece rating, but it does what Shinkai does best, which is more than enough for me to have thoroughly enjoyed the film.",7,AsukaLangley

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
I had the necessity to write this after thinking about the movie for a while.
Opinions are subjetive and if so many people like this so much and call it a masterpiece, good for them, but I just don't undestand why, or more like I don't want to, because I kinda have an idea and I would prefer if it wasn't true.
In any case, I'm not gonna make this too long (I hope). I'll just go to the point.
I enjoyed the first part. Not great, but alright. A typical body switch story that's been done many times before and pretty much the exact
                  same way, but the comedy made it good enough.
And then the second half arrived. To be fair, the twist caught me off guard, for some reason, but...well...
I'm just going to say it. I don't know if this is intencional or just a coincidence, but this just seems like a bad try at ripping off a certain visual novel which I'm sure nobody here knows, but probably knows about Punchline or the Zero Escape series. The creator of those made before them a certain series called Infinity, and the third game of the series is Remember11, a story about a man and a woman in different places (and time) that change bodys randomly for some reason, with the woman dying in the past and the man deciding to save her. Sounds familiar?
Again, maybe it's just a coincidence, but there are quite a bit of them between R11 and this movie. And that wouldn't be a problem (well, it kind of is, because it makes it not unique or original at all, as most people seem to think, ironically like ZE and Punchline fans) if this movie actually had good story and characters, but sadly the story becomes a absolute mess that makes no sense and it doesn't even try to explain itselfs or give any help or hints of how anything is happening or why, and the characters are generic and 1D and fall in love because why not. They barely talked outside of phone notes that were just them saying ""do/don't do x"".
I even found the love between the MC and his senpai more belivable. I don't even know why it uses so much more time building that possible ship between them if it's just forgotten and replaced with an obligatory ship between MCs because reasons.
Going back to the story. I'm not saying they should have tried to explain everything with science, but if they were just gonna do supernatural/fantasy then why build up the mistery of the body switch in the first part? And even if it's just supernatural, it still should have some basic rules of how it works, otherwise everything is just deus ex machina and magic that just happens and works because magic.
And again, even if you just forget about all of the time travel/body switching stuff and just focus on the romance part...well, I've already explained what I think on that.
I only managed to ""survive"" the last part by making fun of it while watching, because I just couldn't take it seriously.
In conclusion, the only reason I give it a 4 and not lower is because of the first part and the animation which is great, and I feel like I'm being generous. In the end it's just a mess that tries to be a romance with a ZE-like plot but is bad on both. Wait no, it does have a well done ZE-like plot, cause it's just as much of a mess. Sorry, couldn't help it.
Just go read the Infinity series. R11 doesn't even try to be a romance and it still infinitely better at it. Sorry again, for the pun I mean.
Yes, I just wanted to rant a lot because I don't understand why some things like this are considered masterpieces. Burn me at the stake, I don't get Spirited Away either.",4,Chanclasman

                I know what you're thinking... you're angry that I gave your favorite movie a score that wasn't a 10 but before you go to my profile and write an angry comment saying I have a shit taste in anime please read what I have to say then feel free to say whatever you want. This is my first review on MAL so please bare with me for a few minutes as im not really that good at making things seem professional.
When I was going into Kimi No Na Wa I was thinking that it was going to be the second coming of christ, (considering it
                  portrayed that way) but oh god I was wrong. And instead of coming out of the movie instead of being emotionally touched, I was actually infuriated that I had wasted my time with this piece of garbage.
Story - 2/10
All I can really say is that they tried.. they tried really hard to make this a compelling, touching, & emotional story, but the way its presented makes nearly everything about this movie fall flat on its face. The story Kimi No Na Wa is nowhere near unique, but that isn't really the problem that I have with it. It's more of how they poorly executed the story actually was, let alone the entire movie. The story of Kimi No Na Wa is a gender bender romance between 2 horrifically bland characters on how they switch bodies and how they learn to communicate with each other and live the life of someone of the opposite gender. When the story is supposed to be a roller coaster of emotions when it actually feels completely rushed and almost nothing about it even seems remotely real. They could have done a lot more and I see what they were trying to do with this film, but this further supports the theory that Makoto Shinkai completely lacks the ability to write anything compelling.
Art - 8/10
I mean good animation is always a plus, to be completely honest they had really good production. Almost everything about the art style was pretty in some way but that doesn't really change the fact that good animation cant save a poorly executed story. To be completely honest the animation is the only reason to watch this movie and nothing else. But if you're only really looking for something that has an amazing animation you'll probably be better if you found something else as it isn't hard to find things that are prettier than this.
Sound - 6/10
Not much to really say here as it doesn't really sound all that amazing or all that bad either. Nothing really stood out to me as that amazing for the sound production. The music was pretty cool I guess? But honestly, I can't really remember anything that was absolutely groundbreaking.
Characters - 2/10 
Oh boy, and the Characters where do I even start. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING is even remotely interesting or unique about the characters in Kimi No Na Wa. I get that its a movie and they don't have as much time to develop the characters than in a normal length anime but Jesus Christ like at least try and make them unique. Both of the main characters are your average cookie cutter male and female anime protagonists. There is NOTHING about either of these characters that stand out. They don't have funny or even interesting personalities. It honestly amazes me how anyone can relate or even feel anything towards these characters.
My Personal Enjoyment - 1/10
I've never actually been angry after finishing something of any sort. If its bad then I kinda just tend to brush it off, forget about it and move on, but as I said earlier I was actually infuriated because of this sorry excuse an emotional romance film. I tried really hard to like this movie trust me I tried really fucking hard to enjoy it, but I honestly just couldn't do it. Almost everything about this movie seemed poorly written and rushed which led to an awful experience. And if I wasn't watching it with a friend I honestly would have stopped halfway through. And honestly, I should have instead of wasting my time when I could have been doing something else. 
Overall - 2/10
I don't really know what else to say the real only redeeming factor was that the animation was good and literally nothing else stood out. it was a poorly written, bland story with even more bland characters. It honestly baffles me on how anyone can think this is anywhere near a masterpiece. I wouldn't even recommend this to anyone who wants even a little bit of good storytelling. Maybe to people that want something pretty so they can turn off their brain and be distracted for 2 hours.
I only really made this review mainly because I have a really strong opinion on this movie as a whole and thought I had to get it out there. Like I said earlier though this is my first review so it would be nice if I could get some feedback on what I could improve on next time. Thank you for taking your time to read my review.",2,taibles
32281,"
                The low-rating reviewers need to round this up for you guys. Kimi no Na wa is a poorly written piece of work that struggle to understand its own themes.
STORY
3 main flaws to be pointed out. 1) lack of direction. It's an issue before knowing what it wants to be, because it doesn't know it's supposed to be anything. Sit me down and make me take notes through a rewatch and I'd still have no idea what this film is about. Probably the intent is some contrived story about star-crossed lovers, an elaborate or posh love boundary, but you can apply ""a love story, a mythological
                  story, a the-universe-is-bigger-than-us story, a coming of youth story, a complex society story"" at any point of the film and still stand to be accurate. Which is fine per se, except there's no clear lead in any one of these themes.
Doesn't know how to use its strengths even, because so much could be done with the supernatural direction of the story which I won't reveal because spoilers. Director Makoto clearly missed out on a chance to emphasize the supernatural aspect of Kimi no Na wa because he doesn't enhance it any way.
Light spoilers ahead. Till now I question what is the purpose of sticking senpai and bespectacled friend to Taki on his road trip?
2) suspension of disbelief. Doesn't even know the name of her town after switching so many times, fine, are you telling me Taki couldn't Google the name of Mitsuha's high school to find out where her town is? That's one. A leap of faith and forced acceptance that they're suddenly star-crossed lovers. When... exactly did they fall in love? Off-screen? Sure I can imagine the in-betweens but it's not exactly satisfying and it's very rushed because I'm supposed to be focusing on Taki and his next actions. That's another.
3) mismatched themes. This is difficult to talk about without heavy spoilers but just know that a common tale consistently brought up by grandma has nothing in relation with the main theme of their series: which is your name. This name theme, this main theme, doesn't tie in well with any one thing in the film and I question, what does names have to do with this film really? It is never explained in any mythological aspect and if you expect us to accept it for a reason as simple as ""a name ties in to a person's existence"" I think this film has been carting down the wrong lane with all the other supernatural themes it's been pulling.
The first and second half of the film can appear to be like separate stories, which isn't bad in itself because it did serve to surprise me pleasantly, but serving on their own you'll realize they're both very lackluster be it the first half with its coming of age melodrama or the second half with its lofty and grandiose star crossed lovers plot. May I add that the second half spiral furiously out of control with its plot reasoning? There's just... no reason behind any happening. It happens for the sake of... an awful plot that doesn't know what it is?
Ah maybe another flaw, horrendous flow of story. When they set up a typical star crossed lovers meeting moment it is when a disaster is about to occur and frankly not even half of my attention is on them or remotely interested about their ""love"" when chemistry wasn't even built properly in the first place.
Ending was unsatisfactory because it was so... bland. It baffles me how you can make a film with as unfocused a story and direction as this.
ART
I watched this in horrendous low-quality render but I think its key visuals are pretty stunning in true anime film style.
SOUND
Don’t get me started on Kamiki (Taki’s seiyuu)… and Mitsuha’s seiyuu. I’m a fan of Kamiki in his actor life and he’s always been an enthusiastic and vibrant guy. Shows in his voice acting, doesn’t it? It’s charming and unique enough for me to want him to voice more characters!
OST wise it’s typical fare. I wasn’t smitten but they certainly weren’t hard to the ears.
CHARACTER
Sides shine more than mains really, with one-liners such as ""I thought he was cute,"" in reference to the protag acting weird or ""Nothing really. I’m just gonna stay and continue living in this town,” when asked about future plans. Taki is an average, boyish, slightly thoughtful, conscientious city boy but I struggle to find anything that defines him beyond that. Kimi no Na wa never tried to explore their protag. If you tamed Mitsuha’s drama some, she could have made a decent heroine too.
Would have liked Taki to be more invested in the countryside life, or build a budding connection with grandma, etc. Honestly there are too many things Kimi no Na wa could have done, but never once did! All in favor of some trite, flamboyant story it never had the potential to draw out. I don’t think that was ever its forte, because the best moments in this film were seemingly inconsequential one-liners to me. 
Light spoilers. Grandma though… I feel bad for her. She too had the potential to shine but, as Taki and Mitsuha were, was forced into a mold to move the story along. If she was there discovering Mitsuha wasn’t who she was it could have made for a nice conversational scene between grandma and Taki but all she really did is to impart, casually, the same may or may not have happened to me but the film isn’t wanting you to focus on her, but the fact that this runs in the Miyamizu family.
To sum it up the characters are half-baked. Neither here nor there. You see some glimpses of potential but they never truly get to expand on them. Kimi no Na wa’s characters are simply not memorable enough for me to want to type for them forever.
CONCLUSION
Needless to say I didn’t enjoy this all that much. It’s a very disappointing film be it in its story or character through and through. Visuals are beautiful ofc, but I wonder if that's all you need to pull you through a show? I wouldn't be inclined to waste my time like that.

                Makoto Shinkai is a name that, to many, equates with “feels.” Whether it’s Voices from a Distant Star, the Children Who Chase Lost Voices, or the classic 5 Centimeters per Second, Shinkai’s films carry the guarantee of beautiful animation and emotional depth rarely seen in anime. Kimi no Na Wa, “Your Name,” is no exception to the trend. If anything, Your Name is the end product of years of experimentation with storytelling and filmmaking – the story that Shinkai has always wanted, and tried, to tell, finally made real, and done so in a satisfying, entertaining, and heart-wrenching way.
Your Name is the story of two
                  people: Mitsuha Miyamizu, a shrine maiden in the rural Japanese countryside, and Taki Tachibana, a stock standard highschool student in Tokyo. Their irregular body-swapping isn’t the sort that leaves much of a solid mark – their memories of swaps are hazy, and they can’t exactly take notes with them, and more importantly they’ve never even met. Yet here, one of the first themes Shinkai communicates comes forward – the echoes left by a person’s life, by their actions and in the people around them, is just as good as meeting the person themselves. Mitsuha and Taki both get to learn about each other not only during their body swaps, but in seeing the aftereffects of each others’ antics while swapped, be it Taki’s boldness in her body or Mitsuha’s setting up Taki’s love life in his. Love, as told by Shinkai, is more than just affection for a person – it’s in the things we do for others and what they do for us.
The core theme of Your Name is “musubi” – a word that describes coming together and growing apart, starting a journey and reaching its conclusion, and the ebb and flow of time and fate. It is a word that, perhaps, summarizes the whole of Makoto Shinkai’s stories on the topic of love and fate – it describes the insatiable urge to find the one you’re destined to be with, as explored in Voices from a Distant Star, and likewise the unavoidable flow of time that pulls people apart and leads to new beginnings, as in 5 Centimeters per Second. The topic of musubi dominates the story of Your Name, in a manner that makes the movie both coherent in its own plot and insightful in its approach to the standard “red string of fate” story. 
It is difficult to put into words exactly why Your Name resonates on the threads it does (pun intended), but it has to do with the raw elegance with which the theme of musubi is presented. It encompasses both the sappy and giddy optimism of true love winning out, and the melancholy acceptance of time moving on. It perfectly describes the “why” to the red string of fate, and why that symbol holds so much power in the mind. 
Of course, it goes without saying that the fundamentals of Your Name – the animation, the voice acting, and the like – are of the top quality. The name that Shinkai has made for himself and his works in regards to raw quality is strong for a reason – Your Name does not disappoint visually, or audibly. Of particular note is the ear-orgasming soundtrack, provided by RADWIMPS, who provided both the trailer music as well as several in-film songs. Rather than simply searching for music that matched his artistic vision retroactively, Makoto Shinkai sought out RADWIMPS’ inclusion in the film from the get-go, and the result of integrating them so early into the creative process is evident every time the film’s soundtrack gets going. If nothing else, Your Name is a movie that can be watched for the music.
Your Name is, if anything, a classic Makoto Shinkai work. It is beautiful, both in visuals and in story. It tugs at the heartstrings, appealing to things that every viewer can identify with, either out of personal experience or out of desire to experience. But more than anything else, it leaves the audience satisfied, throughout its runtime and in its conclusion, with a story well told. Your Name handily takes its place as not just my favorite Shinkai film, but my favorite film entirely.",10,xthorgoldx

Enjoyment: 9
Overall: 9-9.5 
Story: Going into this without knowing anything about the movie; not even the trailer, I was kind of confused from the first 10-20 minutes until it became clear what was going on with their bodies. Both the MC’s come from different backgrounds, girl from a village/ small town and boy from the big city of Tokyo. Without spoiling the movie entirely, the film takes a huge turn somewhere around the middle where it becomes more than just an animated Freaky Friday. 
Art: Even while watching this on medium-low quality I was amazed by how immersive
                  the art-style is. The amount of great overhead shots of the busy city of Tokyo to the large crater-esque shrine was gorgeous sight to behold. There is one scene in particular, with the comet, that completely made me forget that I was watching something animated and not a laser light show in a planetarium. 
Sound: There are several songs from this movie that are a must-have for me. Normally I don’t compliment an animated movie for its music but Kimi no Na wa did a smashing job. I found the montage/ recap style music to be great and helped summarize what was going on and in addition to that the editing to the music was phenomenal to go along with what was going on in the screen. 
Character: I won’t include character design in art because the atmosphere and world-building in its own deserved a 10/10. Now for character design I will say that some of the characters look a bit generic and halfway through I thought to myself Taki kind of looks like the MC from Konosubarashi. Out of everything in this film I will say that the characters are the weakest point but their traits, friends and personalities make them relatable and appeal to viewers. For the better half of the movie, the MC’s are mostly doing regular student or after-school part time worker activates that most anime watchers have seen in other shows. 
Enjoyment: As someone who is not big on the school/ drama genres, I was a bit hesitant to give this movie a shot. However, the school tag is not so relevant and aside from the main characters being in school/ around it; it has no huge implications to the story. As for drama, the family ties each character had, to their respective families, played a huge part in getting the viewer invested. I found myself feeling both happy and sad whenever a character was being pelted with bad news/ going through tough times. I also enjoyed all the small chit-chat and conversations Mitsuha had with her sister or grandmother. 
Overall I found the film to blow-away any expectations I had from the first few minutes of viewing. It will make you laugh/ giggle, cry, feel happy, cry, then sad, cry some more.   
Should you watch it? 
Do you enjoy sad romance movies? 
Do you enjoy movies about time/ space?
Look for relatable characters in movies?
Is art style and sound something you look for in a move?
Looking for a movie you can’t explain to friends without having them see it with you? 
Enjoy crying? 
If any of these were yes/ maybe, then please take a seat, get some popcorn, tissues and maybe some friends to enjoy it with. This is certainly a film you don’t just watch once. 
Despite coming out recently, as I write this review, I’d consider it my favorite if not top contender for favorite anime movie.

                *Review contains spoilers*
Kimi no Na wa is the new movie from acclaimed director Makoto Shinkai who’s behind 5 Centimeters per second, Hoshi no Koe and The Place Promised in Our Early Days. 
His new movie tells a story about a high school student Taki and a high school student Mitsuha suddenly swapping bodies but forgetting what they did during their swap after it ends, so they begin to communicate via diaries and messages left behind by the other person. 
The story of Kimi no Na Wa is simple. There are some themes but they are light. The movie however suffers from several plot holes and
                  plot conveniences. They do not destroy the overall enjoyment of the movie since to me, it was never about some hard smart writing and complex ideas. It was about this interesting scenario of body swapping and how can you add different twists to it while still remaining true to your style of storytelling and visual art. 
The characters are unfortunately not that interesting. What I however can praise is that both male and female main characters show strong sides of themselves when they swap.  Mitsuha succeeds with her delicate and femine acting where Taki was not successful. Meanwhile Taki with his direct aggressive approach solves the situation where Mitsuha would potentially fail. The movie doesn’t simply go into “well Mitsuha is a girl so she’ll act cute while Taki is a boy so he’ll simply do boyish stuff which will lead into comedic moments” which makes me greatful for actually more realistic approach of this potential situation. Protagonists show their strong sides while as well showing their weaknesses. In a sense they complete each other
It’s not even worth to write about animation and music. We all know its top tier. We all know people love it. 
So overall, is it good? Yes it is! It’s not 10/10 zomfg best movie of all time, but it’s a great fun movie. I enjoyed it a lot for what it is. I am going to do the unthinkable and throw logic behind my head. This one is not about that. It’s about atmosphere and feeling. Are there plot holes and weird coincidences? Yes. Does it matter this time? Not to me.",7,Zerathus

                HUGE SPOILERS BELOW
Kimi no Na wa. is a movie about meaningless infatuation, sexual assault, breaking the UK's age of consent laws, and traveling through time by drinking spit. It continues the trend of every Makoto Shinkai movie being identical to the last; after all, it's a romance ""drama"" that fails to be dramatic in any way due to how unbelievably bland the main characters are. Except, this time Shinkai has spiced everything up by adding in sexual assault and a massive amount of plot holes, the latter resulting from the fact that he is too incompetent to write anything that isn't a generic high school
                  romance. Even with how breathtaking the art, animation, and sound are, Kimi no Na wa. fails to be any more than slightly enjoyable due to the poor quality of writing that has come to be expected of Shinkai. To finish off this introduction, I'd like to bring in a quote from one of history's most important individuals: Nobel Peace Prize recipient Martin Luther King Jr: ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a world where the funds funneled into Makoto Shinkai are instead given to someone who can write a basic time travel gimmick.""
Let's begin with the characters. Mitsuha lives in a small village, and her whole character is that she doesn't like living in a small village. Taki lives in Tokyo, and, uh… likes drawing? Every side character is either completely useless or a MacGuffin.
Moving on to the plot... Nah, I'm just kidding.
I'll try to milk any possible interesting traits pertaining to either of the main characters, given what the movie has provided me with. What we are told about Taki is that he lives in Tokyo, he likes drawing, and he has a relatively average life. The only other relevant piece of information we are ever given about him is that he initially has a crush on Okudera. That is legitimately it. No other personality traits, character traits, or interests are offered. No matter how hard I think about it, there's nothing else I can say about him. Mitsuha is slightly better defined. Her personality goes slightly beyond bland, with her occasionally being annoying. Her continuous complaints about how horrible her village is often become overbearing. Besides for wanting to leave her village for no apparent reason other than that her village sucks, she also has a strained relationship with her dad. If only Shinkai decided to, I don't know, explore said relationship. But no, giving characters intriguing personalities or backstories is beyond the scope of his expertise. At the end of the day, we are given basically no prior information about the characters—thus, they are uninteresting and unrelatable. The poor quality of these characters completely nullifies any and all dramatic moments that the movie offers, since, for such drama to work, you have to care about the characters. Having normal people as main characters is not inherently bad, but normal people have at least some semblance of a personality. Taki and Mitsuha do not.
It would be great if the characters were simply uninteresting and generic. But no; an average character is too difficult for Shinkai to write. Instead, the characters have to perpetually act like complete buffoons who are incapable of making rational decisions. Let's just go through some of the situations Taki and Mitsuha find themselves in and analyze their reactions. Imagine you one day go to sleep, only to wake up and find yourself in a house that is not your own. Furthermore, you are now in a body that belongs to someone else. I, and I assume any rational human, would certainly freak out at such a proposition. After freaking out, we would attempt to assess our situation and figure out what happened. How do Taki and Mitsuha react? After sexually assaulting each other, they just carry out the other person's daily routine. At this point, I would like to note that due to the super cool Sci-Fi 3-year difference between them, a 20-year-old woman technically assaulted a 17-year-old boy. That constitutes pedophilia in a large number of countries! Fun! Back on track, Mitsuha's reasoning for simply carrying on with daily life is that she's probably in a dream. That makes total sense! It's not like she experienced pain, used a map application on her phone to navigate to a school, and is overall in a place she's never been to before, talking to people she's never met. Personally, I can't name a single time I did any of those things in a dream, but sure. Other examples of perfectly logical decisions are when Mitsuha decides to embroider a flower pattern onto the waitress uniform of a high-class restaurant, when Taki decides to randomly kick over a desk in Mitsuha's body, and when Mitsuha (or was it Taki in her body? Can't remember at this point) decides to randomly bike over a tree root so that her bike can dramatically come crashing down off of a cliff.
Now you might say that I'm just nitpicking over unimportant plot elements so far. That is true to a certain extent, but I still find these idiotic decisions to be infuriating. However, nothing pisses me off more than the whole concept of a romance forming between these two characters. They have legitimately never met. They've simply experienced each other's lives. The only interactions they've had with each other is committing crimes on each other's bodies. Yet no, Shinkai wants us to believe that these two people who have never met face to face are perfect for each other. The viewer is simply supposed to accept that. Are we now celebrating irresponsible, meaningless infatuation? What they share is clearly not love; after all, you can't love someone you've never met. So apparently this romantic drama is not only not a drama, but it's not a romance either.
The side characters are even worse than the mains, even though one of our mains is defined only by the phrase ""I live in Tokyo"". Every single side character besides Teshigawara and Sayaka could have been removed from the movie, and the movie would not lose anything at all. I'm serious. They contribute nothing to the plot whatsoever. But hey, what do Teshigawara and Sayaka do, that the movie would actually suffer were they to be removed? They progress the plot. That's it. Teshigawara magically obtains explosives and can hack into the whole city's speaker system. (Where he obtained such intricate technological knowledge, and also why Mitsuha possesses a smartphone in the year 2013, is completely beyond me, as their village is supposedly so small that a cafe simply does not exist there. Also, it's quite interesting that a construction site's security is so lax that a high school student can waltz in and grab some explosives. Anyway, back on track.) Sayaka talks on said speaker system. And that's all they contribute to the plot. Oh, I nearly forgot that Mitsuha's grandmother is Kimi no Na wa.'s equivalent of Kara no Kyoukai's Aozaki—a character that exists solely for the purpose of infodumps. That pretty much wraps up the character section.
I'll split the plot section into two parts: pacing and plot holes, as that's all there is in terms of story: horrible pacing and a plot with more holes than a piece of Jarlsberg.
The movie is effectively split into two distinct sections: cringy SoL that is apparently supposed to be funny, and the latter half, where Shinkai drops his trademark Drama Brick onto your skull. The first half is actually a half-decent movie! Besides the previously mentioned bizarre decisions, an overall lack of characters, and the fact that why they begin to switch bodies is never explained, nothing sticks out as extraordinarily bad. Taki and Mitsuha live in each other's bodies and have relatively fun experiences. I personally found the failures of the characters to be quite cringy, yet the first half of the movie was overall light, enjoyable, and even occasionally funny. 
Then the shit hit the fan. Or the Drama Brick broke through your parietal bone. Whichever expression you prefer. Just as they begin to fall in love for no conceivable reason other than plot convenience, it turns out that Mitsuha is literally dead and that they are separated by a mysterious three-year gap (this absolute garbage will be thoroughly discussed in the plot hole section, give me a second). So now, Tokyo Boy has to save the town from a meteorite by drinking Mitsuha's saliva. No, this is seriously the plot. It really is. It seems like I'm taking the piss, but I'm not. Taki goes to the village and drinks some sake that was created through the process of Mitsuha chewing up rice and then spitting it out, then leaving said concoction to ferment. After that, he goes to some mysterious place where it's just Mitsuha and him talking. Then through some contrived turn of events, Mitsuha evacuates everyone by using the aforementioned explosives and village-wide speaker system right as the meteorite hits. Almost sounds interesting, right? Well, most of the evacuation happens off-screen. Nice! Anyway, all of the Sci-Fi elements are justified by an explanation so contrived and illogical that it beats out Futaba's infamous ""metaphysics"" from Seishun Buta Yarou. I wish I could properly analyze the plot, but after watching the movie and reading numerous explanations as to what happened, I still fail to see what Musubi even is, which is the thing commonly credited with causing the time gap phenomenon. Anyway, it doesn't make sense—that's all that matters.
I could write a college thesis-length paper on all of the plot holes in this movie, but I'll limit myself to the two that distressed me the most. First, Mitsuha's consciousness disappears into an abyss for a whole day. The sequence of events in the first thirty minutes of the movie goes something like this: Taki switches into Mitsuha's body and spends a day as her -> Mitsuha is back to normal and goes to her festival -> Mitsuha transports into Taki's body. Part of me wants to explain this away as Sci-Fi bullshit that makes sense because of the time gap, and another part of me tells me that this whole sequence makes absolutely no sense. The whole swapping bodies thing ceases to make any sense whatsoever once you consider that they are both in the exact same time zone and that they most likely sleep at about the same exact time. So, hey, just turn your brain off and enjoy the generic, senseless ""romance"" between two bland characters. 
The next plot hole is the huge one, the one everyone talks about. How did they manage to spend weeks inside of each others' bodies without ever coming in contact with a calendar? The only conceivable answer is plot convenience. I doubt any sentient creature needs me to explain that an average person makes contact with a calendar pretty much daily, so I won't. But let's assume for a moment that they, by some impossibly low probability, didn't see the date even once during multiple weeks. Even so, a three-year gap, especially in the second decade of the 21st century, should be immediately noticeable. Between 2013 and 2016, not one but two new iPhone models were made, the hoverboard became a well-known malignant tumor that anyone living in a major city has come in contact with, the Oculus Rift came about, and I could go on and on. This is the one major plothole of the movie that is 100% impossible to explain away, no matter how much you contrive the plot.
Unlike the pathetically written story and characters, Shinkai proves his competence in the visual department. The realism and beauty of the backgrounds capture whatever scenery they’re in. The backgrounds are so detailed that I sometimes genuinely mistook them for real pictures, almost making me forget that they were drawn by an overworked Japanese man who works long hours while receiving a minuscule wage, only to fade into the realm of obscurity while a talentless hack like Shinkai gets credit for the quality of the visuals. The character designs are distinctive, they help set apart Kimi no Na wa.’s characters apart from each other and from other anime characters. What helps that process most is the animation. The animation really helps showcase the body language and expressions of the characters; even in more mundane scenes, it helps display the realism of the characters… oh, wait.
The voice acting was fine. I thought all voice actors captured their respective character’s personality nicely. Mitsuha’s was slightly annoying, which fits her personality quite well. The soundtrack is amazing at setting an appropriate atmosphere for both comedic and dramatic moments. This is in great contrast with the actual movie, as the comic scenes are only moderately funny, while the dramatic scenes are not sad whatsoever. Kimi no Na wa. not only has immaculately detailed visuals but detailed sound design as well. Capturing the smallest details, such as cars passing by, wildlife and even footsteps, it is clear that world-class sound designers gave their best efforts in the creation of this movie. The astounding quality of the visuals and the audio complement each other quite well and almost actually make this movie, which would otherwise receive a score no higher than 3/10, into a relatively enjoyable experience.
I'd love to say that the reason behind CoMix Wave continuing to employ Shinkai and funneling money into his pathetic attempts at movies is beyond me, but it really isn't. This garbage makes tons of money by appealing to 14-year-olds who couldn't care less about the quality of what they're watching. It looks good and it's (supposed to be) sad! 10/10! Overall, I have been struck by an epiphany. The best way to enjoy Kimi no Na wa. is to simply not pay any attention whatsoever as to what is happening on your screen. Instead, blankly stare at your monitor in awestruck appreciation of the visuals while listening to the amazing soundtrack.

                Like most other people, I came here to watch Kimi no Na Wa primarily because is rated number 1 on myanimelist.
Having Watched Garden of Words, 5 Centimeters a Second, I could kind of guess that Kimi No Na Wa would be a film of similar caliber. By similar caliber, I mean astounding visuals but lacking in plot and character. Kimi no Na Wa follows this trend, but flops completely when it comes to story and character. 
Story 1/10
To be honest, I would give the story less than 1 if I could. Its not unexpected however, If you've watched similar movies such as Garden of Words
                  and 5 Centimeters. However, Kimi no na Wa does exceptionally bad at the story. 
Although a general slice of life, romantic comedy is acceptable, Kimi no Na Wa attempted to try to become something it was not. Most notable is the beginning of the story, in which the characters swap bodies and affect each others lives. Although this part of the story is admittedly generic and not outstandingly creative, it does give the story a casual air to it, which also leads to some throwback humor as well. I admit that I personally was curious as to how severely the main characters could alter each others lives. However, the story goes in the wrong direction when it attempts to swing the entire story towards disaster.
If Kimi no Na Wa was simply a romantic comedy with some quirks and spins of its own, the story would be acceptable. However the story completely destroys what little it had by beginning to focus on the meteor falling apart, which leads to ideas such as amnesia, body swapping, death, and some ridiculous plot holes. 
Although no story is without flaw, Kimi no Na Wa fails to explain what is happening, and gives not the slightest clue as to why it is happening. After watching the movie, nobody knows why the main character's can't remember each other, why the male protagonist randomly decides to search for the girl, and why they swapped bodies. However that's not it.
The major sins of the story lie in the ridiculous concepts. The writers attempt to convince you that a child is able to first convince her friends that they are all going to die, and then proceeds to convince her father, the Mayor as well, who ultimately evacuates the entire town. It's hard to swallow that her friends could simply nod their heads and accept that they are going to die today, and its even more ridiculous how she was able to convince her father.
It only adds to my disappointment that the movie doesn't even show how she convinced her father, and simply cuts it out. 
I could write a book on Kimi no Na Wa's story, but lets just leave it at the most outstanding major flaws.
Character 1/10
Unless you are living under a rock and haven't watched at least 1 descent movie, its clear that Kimi no Na Wa fails when it comes to characters.
The character themselves are bland, boring, and most importantly, have ideals, goals and ideas that the watcher simply cannot understand. 
There's no clear indicator as to why the characters fall in love, and what they like about each other. However their unrealistic motives only add to their already boring characteristics.
And let me just say that boring characters are at times, okay. When it comes to casual shows or a simple slice of life, one can expect a character to be somewhat bland. However as a show that tries to make a huge impact, Kimi no Na Wa's characters jump from stagnant to super heroes, which gives the viewer no room for connection as the characters seem to act as puppets whose only purposes are to allow for the story to develop.
In general, the characters begin as generic and boring, and ended off as unrealistic and even more bland than before.
Art 10/10
However not all is lost, as Kimi no Na Wa shines in its vivid animation and golden scenery. This is to be expected by the producing studio, and it does not disappoint.
Sound 8/10
This is to be expected for any movie.
Enjoyment 3/10
I hate to rate enjoyment, as I was slightly interested in the beginning but quickly lost all interest as the story progressed. The arts good, so I wont give it a 1/10.
Overall 1/10
My general advice to you is to watch the movie and critique it by yourself first, without the input of others. However if you are reading this review, then I'm preaching to the wrong people. If you truly love this movie, then there is not much I can do for you. However I would not recommend this movie to anyone, as there are so many better movies out there begging to be watched. Go watch a Gibly film and do yourself a favor.",1,DeAeD

                *You’ve probably already seen this movie but regardless, mild spoilers for the premise that truly reveals itself whole past the synopsis and maybe a few specific spoilers along the way*
When most people think of Kimi no Na wa, they think of a simple emotionally gripping, beautifully animated masterpiece that touched them at their very core. When I think of Kimi no Na wa, I think of a tedious, convoluted, contrived, and ultimately misguided emotion-based time travel story blessed with wonderful visuals and cursed by its confusingly bad time travel narrative and equally hard to stomach main leads.
I know, I’m a buzzkill. 
So, why my cynicism?
                  Before you try to answer, let me take two of them out for you. It has little to do with it being in the top 10 on every anime aggregation website, or the fact that this not only outsold every single Ghibli movie such as the insanely popular Spirited Away, or that it is the highest grossing anime movie of all time as of writing. I don't feel it was anywhere near good enough to warrant any of that, but it would be incredibly petty of me to call that a reason I dislike the film. With that out of the way, let's begin with the writing.
A boy and a girl suddenly wake up from a dream, only to realize that their bodies have switched. I must say, right out the bat, I like the fact that each new day is told from the perspective of one of the two characters while switching perspectives to suit a new day in the beginning and that it starts on a character being explained to how she was acting weird, and putting two and two together allows us to see that this is the aftermath of one of these body-switching incidents that occur a lot throughout this movie. This is where the compliments of the story end for a while.
How long have these two been switching bodies? Given the montage especially, it's insanely hard to keep track, and I know it's all thanks to a comet, but I doubt a comet would remain visible for a small country like Japan for so long that the montage sort of hints at weeks of this happening? How come these characters start off thinking they're in a dream, even after feeling pain (especially given the whole gag cliche based around this exact trope of waking up after pain in a dream) and seeing the entire day go by in real-time? I know full well that no dream lasts that long without entering at least one period of long, non-R.E.M. sleep (and R.E.M. lasts for about 15 minutes and that's when you dream, and dreams are never this coherent)? How come after so long, nobody tries to put two and two together about this whole thing with their own theories until the second half? Speaking of the second half…
The second half is where this movie turns from just irritating to convoluted and contrived. A comet from 3 years ago is seen 3 years later (I can't fathom how that's supposed to work, especially in such a short amount of time given a comet or a star) by these two main characters and that's what caused them to switched bodies with each other every day, and only them for no adequately explained reason, and that's a missed opportunity. We could've had scenes of some other people acting weird because of that too, though they would still need to explain it well beyond time travel-esque bullshit that doesn't explain anything. It turns out that two people end up, for no good reason, figuring it out: the grandmother of the girl, and the girl’s father. An explosion happens at one point in a major facility and no one considered that a  dangerous threat after being told that more of this can happen (though it's a diversion to evacuate the people from 3 years ago because apparently the comet splits and destroys the city that the girl was in, including her, meaning it would make no sense how she could connect with him, especially since the ending sort of rewrites that, which sort of changes the future but people can't do a good time travel plot for shit). The ending also just ends with the two sort of recognizing each other and then rolling to credits after panning up towards the clouds, so...that's something, I guess.
I had to go back and research literally every character’s name, they were that forgettable. It's not even like Rogue One where they either say most characters’ names once or not at all, they say these guys’ names constantly. This has never happened to me before for any anime. Let that sink in...and then realize how funny it is that the movie is translated as “Your Name” given these circumstances.
Taki and Mitsuha are dense, extremely dense. I mean, I’m a bit of a dense person myself as anyone who knows me IRL for longer than a small bit will tell you, but these two are infuriatingly dense to the point of actual stupidity. There was the “dream” example from earlier but also, these guys constantly set rules for each other to not interfere much with their lives, only to constantly break them. They conveniently forget things for the sake of the plot, though to be fair, that's just the plot actively forcing them to forget things for no reason and not then being idiots, so back to that. When Mitsuha meets Taki in the emotional climax of the film, she straight up calls him an idiot over the fact that he often played with her tits when he woke up in her body...and this is the first thing g she says to him in the middle of an emotional climax. Not “I finally found you” or something befitting of such a scene where they first sorta meet each other truly within the little time they have before convenient BS makes it so they physically don't see each other anymore and proceed to go on their way to accomplish a necessary task, but “Baka”. Fucking really?
It's insanely hard to talk about any of the characters’ personalities since while outside of the protagonists, none of these are truly bad characters, they are insanely forgettable. I forgot everything about these people by the time I finished the movie, aside from the fact that Mitsuha's little sister doesn't like taking shit from people, and that she conveniently forgets something too (not even for plot convenience this time, just her being an idiot at one point in the final act). I genuinely cannot describe these people, and again, this has never, ever happened to me before! That is a cardinal sin for a movie so focused on pathos! So, fuck it; moving on!
If nothing else can be said, let it be known that this is a rather gorgeous film. CoMix Wave Films did an amazing job with the visuals and digital effects here, especially with the environment. Shoutouts to how jaw-dropping the comet was and how despite many shots being busy as hell, they all still look beautiful. Sure, the character designs are pretty bland and I don't enjoy the equally plain and sometimes malformed art style in general but it's all animated incredibly well for the most part. Sometimes it seems as if the characters are animated in CG with 2D artwork put over them as the movements can feel almost uncanny every now and then, but rarely was it that distracting. There are some moments looked insanely choppy with blatantly low frame rates in comparison to everything else, though as per usual, this is apparently fixed in blu-rays and cinemas. Regardless, the film still looks amazing, even if the studio apparently ran out of budget for this film, and the fact that such a thing isn't noticeable at all is astounding, probably thanks to good cinematography and stellar digital effects.
RADWIMPS does several vocal tracks for the film's opening, ending, and background. None of them stick out, unfortunately, though that doesn't mean they're bad. In fact, after relistening to some of them, I find them mediocre at worst and decent at best. If there are any non-vocal background tracks, I don't remember them either. Ironic given what this film is about, which leads me to my final thoughts.
For a film about remembering, this film is awfully forgettable, especially in terms of its characters. As visually stunning as it is, I felt more annoyed than touched. This is easily the most forgettable film I've seen in quite some time, and it's not all that terrible but it's certainly not good in the slightest either from anything other than a visual perspective. Certainly not Number One anime film worthy, especially not when it's this contrived and unintentionally convoluted at time travel. I remember there was something about the director, Makoto Shinkai himself telling people to stop seeing this movie. He claimed that he didn't want people to see this as his magnum opus and for people to hold all of his films to that standard from now on, especially given the production issues that occurred towards the end. For me, I wouldn't know if this was his best film yet, but if so, then I dread his current filmography. With all that said, I bid you adieu.",4,CodeBlazeFate

                When I saw the reviews and the rating that this anime has got, I was so intrigued. It's been rated much better than FMA:B or Gintama or HxH. Well, I was obviously hyped and unfortunately, this movie did NOT live up to its expectations.
Read on, but mild SPOILERS ahead:
---start of spoilers---
what irked me the most were the obvious GLARING mistakes in the plot. Both these kids exchange each others bodies and live as each other and go to each others school. Now, I dunno about you, but I remember writing dates in my notes EVERYDAY, along with the YEAR. I also always notice the year
                  in my phone, not just the time and date of the month. 
Besides, a friggin' meteor falling on a town and killing hundreds is NEWS that's gonna last friggin months along with the devastating video/photos, which is what happens after every calamity. It's ridiculous that none of the people recognised the damn scenery when that town should've been friggin' famous.
Pop culture, politicians, international events are just some of the things that change rapidly over 3, besides the softwares of your phone. Sigh.
---end of spoilers---
So in a nutshell, if you ignore the glaring inconsistencies and plot holes that really make this anime not for those who like a robust story, what you're left with is a cutesy romance story that has a mix of supernatural in it. Yea, doesn't sound spectacular now does it? I definitely wouldn't watch it a second time. The art and sound make the animation pretty good. But the story itself really fails to impress imho. The characters are also nothing special. There isn't much development of either of the two. I suppose it's silly to expect that from a two hour movie in the first place. I don't like stories that put a bit too much drama in it, and well, this one did overdo it a bit with the constant loss of memory for no reason (there was no reason why the guy had to lose memories of a meteor crash, cause it was independent of the girl anyway)
I really don't understand why this has been rated so highly. I guess the ratings will go down eventually.",6,alexonxanax

                Yielded by some as a new generation Miyazaki equivalent, Makoto Shinkai has become an increasingly popular name within the anime industry. Shinkai's most well-known work, 5 Centimeters Per Second, has long since swooned the hearts of many, crafting a public fascination with his talent and immense potential for animated film. Kimi no Na wa (Your Name), without a doubt, captures the same feeling and style that is associated with Makoto Shinkai's past works, however also seems a bit more experimental and unconventional in comparison. Shinkai took a gamble at trying something new with Kimi no Na wa and, by all means, it certainly paid off.
One
                  of the most notable differences between Kimi no Na wa and Shinkai's previous films is the abundance of humor and a feeling of lightheartedness that one would expect to find in a seasonal airing slice of life. For a Shinkai film, which are notorious for being somewhat depressing, Kimi no Na was something of a pleasant surprise. There were many references to Shinkai's other works, most notably 5 Centimeters Per Second and The Garden of Words, which also offered a sense of excitement (if caught). The film plays out similarly to a quirky, fun slice of life until it begins to reach the movie's main conflict. While the first half of the movie, roughly, had a light, fun air to it, it transitions fairly abruptly to the more serious plot. As a slight directing mistake, it is similar to transitioning from a warm smile to a somber frown and one of the few blemishes that afflict the film.
Kimi no Na wa focuses heavily on the two main characters and the developing bond they have shared due to supernatural circumstances. Ultimately, the overarching story isn't anything complex or immensely special. It is a romantically focused movie and, as such, puts romance in front of everything else. Though the romance itself was nice, the resolution of the main conflict is both perplexing and contrived. Thankfully this and the previously mentioned halfway transition do not hinder one's enjoyment of the film. However, in terms of writing and overall story, Shinkai could still use some work. If nothing else, Kimi no Na Wa is a reflection of Shinkai's willingness to step outside of his comfort zone to improve his craft. Despite a few hiccups here, I believe he will have great things in store for us within his future projects.
Mitsuha and Taki are the two main characters of Kimi no Na wa, and most of the film revolves around their contrasting lives. Mitsuha lives in the countryside, while Taki lives in the grand city of Tokyo. Through supernatural circumstances, they form a bond with each other and have their fill of comedic, fun shenanigans. While both characters are enjoyable to watch, not much depth really goes into either of them. In fact, not much depth really goes into any of the characters of the film period. While it works with how the movie is constructed, it leaves characters feeling rather shallow. Aside from Mitsuha, we don't know all too much about Taki, or any of the other supporting cast, and it's a bit disappointing. Kimi no Na wa could have possibly remedied this simply by being longer, but adding to the already lengthy exposition could have questionable results.
In terms of art, sound, and animation, there really is nothing negative to say. Shinkai is very well-known for producing visually astounding films, with people occasionally joking that 5 Centimeters Per Second is essentially 5 wallpapers per second. Kimi no Na wa is no different. It is a very gorgeous film from start to finish. From the characters to the scenery, the film is stellar, with Makoto Shinkai pulling no punches. Sound-wise, the film is also very good. Soundtrack selection is very fitting, and nothing feels out of place. 
Overall, Kimi no Na wa was a very good film, though not nearly as perfect as many people, who have also seen the premiere, are claiming it to be. There are a few issues that hold the film back, but it is easily still worth two hours of anyone's time. With Makoto Shinkai creating quality works such as Your Name, it has, and will, become increasingly difficult to forget his.",8,Satire

                With the exception of maybe Dokyuusei, I can't think of a single original anime movie in recent times that has gotten as much fanfare as Makoto Shinkai's latest work did before it became available to the gaijin public. Even before it arrived in Japanese theatres, the fanbase that erupted from its exclusive Anime Expo-showing have been making their voices louder than a Siberian tiger scratching the world's largest chalkboard. And now that it has arrived in the Eastern theatres, it's made more money on its opening weekend than The Nice Guys had during its entire box office run. Whilst its currently high MAL score is
                  almost guaranteed to go down once it reaches the wider audience that is America's toxic anime fanbase, the fact remains that Shinkai has really hit the big leagues as of late, and as one of anime's last remaining auteurs (let alone one that's actually good), I think that alone should be worth celebrating.
Will he become the next Miyazaki as time goes on? I don't know, and quite frankly I doubt he cares, so why should I? This isn't a review of his career anyways. It's a review of Your Name, or Kimi no Na wa as the weeaboos like to call it, and I was really looking forward to watching this one once I discovered that the premise was about a boy and a girl going through a Freaky Friday routine, because that's usually the kind of premise reserved for a cheap harem anime or One Piece. Not something you'd expect a man of Shinkai's caliber to do, and especially not a premise deserving of so much visual porn that it'd make art students cum within five seconds of exposure. Sure when you think about it, it's not too far out of his domain. Shinkai has dabbled with putting a serious take on wacky anime premises in the past (his first major work was basically a modern take on Gunbuster after all). Still, I never really expected this sort of premise to get a big-budget treatment in general unless it was a cheap franchise movie, let alone be put in the hands of such a talented guy. And now that I've seen the result of that combination, I can safely say I should never underestimate this dude.
Now before going on, I should point out that I'm fully aware most of you guys haven't had a chance to see the movie as of this time of writing, and unfortunately I can't talk about the majority of Your Name's story because of how heavily dependent it is on things not being as clear-cut as they seem. That's right. A movie about a boy and a girl who can swap bodies with each other has a lot going on underneath the surface that I can't spoil for fear of ruining your enjoyment like all of pop culture does for Citizen Kane. So let's just start off by saying that I do recommend Your Name. It's easily one of the best anime I've seen this year (not that the competition has been all that fierce) as well as one of the most emotional roller coasters that I've seen this medium produce in quite a long time. Oh, and if you are even slightly interested in shipping culture, there is a 99% chance that you will consider this movie a masterpiece, because it pretty much hits every major shipping button in the book - including ones that most hardcore shippers didn't know they had. If you want a more visual representation of what I'm talking about, remember what you loved about ERASED before it went to shit. Now imagine that show never going to shit and make sure to step out of that puddle of drool and tears you just made.
The tone of Your Name is distinctively more ""anime"" than most of Shinkai's stuff. It felt like he was trying to cater more to a mainstream audience whilst not sacrificing his signature style in the process throughout the entire runtime, and if the later Persona games are anything to go by, that can really pay off if done well. And it does pay off in quite a few ways I didn't expect. The movie made me laugh a lot, even at jokes that I wouldn't normally laugh at, and the story actually progressed in a way that I wanted to see things end happily rather than the usual bittersweet closures that I generally love about this guy's take on romance. And any anime that can get that amount of investment from me is always worth my time, even if the characters themselves don't have too much going for them individually.
Having to look up their names for this review is one thing because I'm bad at remember names in general, let alone foreign ones. But if you were to ask me to describe the two leads, I wouldn't have much to say besides a normal girl who wants to be free of the traditions set on her by her family and a normal boy who just wants to get by in life. I think it was an intentional decision on Shinkai's part to make his characters ""normal"" so that we can relate to them more and they're both likable/interesting enough, but I prefer characters who have story to them first, and relatability second. And it's hard to get too invested in a character's dilemma when I'm not given a non-circumstantial reason regarding why I'd want to follow this character in the first place.
For example, the main boy's name is Taki Tachibana, and his goals in life are to get into university, get closer to his hot female co-worker at the restaurant he does part-time work in, and grope his own breasts when he suddenly discovers he has them. That's stuff you can say about any normal Joe, and whilst I can definitely relate to those issues enough to not find Taki boring, the sort of connection I can form with him from just that is limited when I'm not the one who's actually experiencing those problems first-hand. Even when the movie gets into deeper material, Taki never really experiences any emotions or problems that are particular complex to analyze. And considering Shinkai has managed to balance both the intellectual and the emotional aspects of his stories in the past, I found the heavy emphasis on the latter at the expense of the former to be kinda disappointing. Hell, even the majority of Ghibli's output after they peaked did a pretty decent job in that department. Maybe my opinion will change if I watch the movie again (and you can bet I will), but I'm just going to say right now that I liked the character presentation in 5/cm. You fanboys may call it emotionally distant. I call it the solution to you guys overrating the hell out of Holo and Lawrence's thing.
But let's move on to another aspect of Your Name I can actually talk about: the technicals. Frankly, I am quite amazed at how much Shinkai is improving in that field, especially considering how high he sets the bar with each film he does. Not only is the visual quality of the animation so stunning that it makes Garden of Words look like someone's Flash animation and the Radwimps soundtrack one of the most fun anime soundtracks I've heard in quite some time, but the way he utilizes these technicals is so masterful that it can make even the most basic of emotions expressed throughout this film feel like you've just been hit in the face and you want more because you love it. I'm really hard-pressed to come up with a cartoon that gets emotional storytelling down the way the animation in this one does, even compared to what I consider superior cartoons like Kaiba, Haibane Renmei, or a good chunk of Pixar's output. Hell, I'd need a whole other post (and a digital file of the film) just to talk about the specifics.
A lot of you guys are watching Re:Zero, right? Well let's put it like this: if White Fox's ""masterful"" direction of Subaru's bawl-fests is the equivalent of getting hit with a cannonball, Your Name's direction of the emotions constantly vibrating in its characters, setting, dialogue, and just about everything that makes up a single frame of this film is the equivalent of getting hit with a cannonball the size of Jupiter, and there are thousands more frames where that came from. It knows when to play it light. It knows when to play it heavy. It knows just the right amount to make it seem natural. And it doesn't sacrifice more important things in the process. Well okay, I just said it sacrificed some important things a few paragraphs ago. But never to the extent that I ever walked out thinking to myself ""well that was good enough"". The Boy and the Beast is an anime I consider ""good enough"". Your Name is plain good, regardless of the actual magnitude of positive feelings I have for it.
I really wish I could talk more about the plot with you guys, but I can't. Not even regarding the movie's themes, which I'm still not quite clear on myself, but I will tell you that part of the movie's plot was inspired by Japan's recent earthquake disasters. However, I only knew this because Shinkai himself told us. Otherwise, I would never have made the connection, because the ""event"" that said inspiration is based on...well let's just say depending on your suspension of disbelief, you'll consider it emotionally heart-breaking or completely arbitrary. I'm not for heavy-handed commentary or anything, but if there is a deeper meaning that I'm missing in Your Name that'd make me join on the ""masterpiece"" bandwagon with the rest of the die-hards, I really think Shinkai should have made it more obvious. After all, some anvils just need to be dropped, because otherwise you'll risk the opposite problem of people reading too much into things. There's open to interpretation, and then there's just laying out a bunch of plot elements and telling your audience to make their own story.
Don't take my word for it though. Watch the movie yourself and come to your own conclusions. Or watch it because this review has just a raised a million questions regarding what the hell could possibly be in Your Name that's making me so cryptic in regards to describing the experience. Either way works fine. Just don't get spoiled before diving in. You'll probably still enjoy the movie regardless, but there can only be one moment of discovery, and no one should have the right to take it away from you but yourself. And even then, only when you decide that you are ready.",8,Flawfinder

                Makoto Shinkai is without a doubt THE most visionary and diligent Japanese animation director as of 2016. A statement like this is pretty much just a matter-of-fact at this point in time. The man is extraordinarily talented and has a knack for creating fleshed out characters, with compelling story and dialogue to boot. With every subsequent release his films build more anticipation and more hype.
Kudos to him, kudos for all those who enjoy this movie and will continue to enjoy this film, but Makoto Shinkai needs to go back to the drawing board. It seems with every release he gets closer and closer to perfecting
                  his formula and style, and Kimi No Na Wa (your name), sadly was the exception to that trend. Although Shinkai is tweaking and refining all of the elements of his craft, It just left me asking the question ""for what purpose? "" The plot was more drawn out, and more convoluted, and even more crammed into a running time that it could not fit than any of his previous films.
The movie was not bad by any means. Shinkai has come to a point in his career where making a bad film for him would be a challenge. But, this movie has no focus, no direction, and barely any thematic cohesion. 
For the sake of brevity I will leave you with this. Miyazaki, Oshii, Takahata,Shinichiro Watanabe, Satoshi Kon, while all of there movies had flaws, these guys knew how to craft a compelling story! Which is what made their films so memorable in the first place. 
Do yourself a favor and watch one of Shinkai's stronger installments like 5 cm per second or The Place Promised in Our Early Days( if you haven't already) to fully understand my perspective.",5,fastghosthunter

                 Your Name is the new Makoto Shinkai film that everyone has been hyping up for a few months now. I watched it and thought it was alright. Unfortunately, Makoto Shinkai decided to be a bit more experimental with the whole supernatural genre and created a movie that has time travel in it. I swear, I feel like the only things I've reviewed this year are all about time traveling. It's the new thing to get to the top 50 on MAL. Speaking about MAL, why the fuck is it sitting on the #1 spot? 
The first half of the movie is a very cute
                  relationship of these two characters that can somehow body swap during dreams. It's cute, inoffensive and entertaining to watch. I really enjoyed our main characters, even though they're nothing too special. The main guy is alright, I guess. He's the one that I cared the least about, but I was very into the girl. I'm trying very hard to remember their names right now, and I would search it up, but I think this fits the title of the movie. 
Unfortunately, this pretty solid start is dragged down by the weird second half of the movie. I can look pass them not explaining the body swap, especially because it can be interpreted as a metaphor, but then they start time traveling, and nothing really makes much sense after that. And that's my biggest problem with this film; the plot. It's the weakest point. It's alright at first, but then it just drops the ball and never picks it up again.
The best thing about the film is that Makoto Shinkai is one of, if not, the best visual story teller in the anime industry working today. That's always been the beauty of most of his films. Little details are given through visuals that can clear a lot of things up. Not to mention that the film looks amazing. The animation and art is one of the best I've ever seen in anime ever. The soundtrack isn't as memorable as I thought it was going to be. Actually, the song that plays at the end of 5 centimeters per second is a lot more memorable than like, 3 songs in this movie, which I believe are all sang by the same guy.
My expectations weren't high going into the movie, but I still felt a bit disappointed. I don't think Shinkai is the type to work very well with supernatural stories, or even stories in general. His films are usually praised because of the feels and how pretty it looks. Does this film have that? Yes. Does it make the movie better? Yes. Does it make the movie great? No, it really doesn't, especially when the story really drags it down, the characters and soundtrack are simply passable and nothing more.
I would've liked the movie more if it was a tv show focused on the first half, which was rather entertaining and felt warm. That could've been its own thing, but it's rushed and barely explored to get into the whole, ""I have to go find this place that I didn't know that exploded with a meteor to find my girl"". It's just annoying and disappointing to see a film like this fail in different elements.
Surely one of the most annoying things is how convenient everything is. It reminded me of Wolf Children in a lot of ways thanks to this. No, that's not a compliment. They conveniently meet each other during many points in the movie, which is just too unbelievable. Sure, I can let it slide once, but it happens more than once. That's the problem. Also, spoiler alert for the ending, which is honestly just a huge stupid twist to make to make you cry. It's feels convenience. If you don't know what I'm talking about, it's when they meet at the end again. It just comes out of nowhere and they remember themselves for literally no reason. They also conveniently meet each other as spirits (or something) at some point. 
You can say that I missed the entire point, I'm retarded and whatever else because [insert dreams make no sense so the movie doesn't have to either argument], but I just don't think it makes any sense in the second half. Sure, the Shinkai's direction is pretty great, but he's not enough to carry everything in the film. They need a better writer. That's why this film is lacking so much.
Anyways, yes I do think that this a step down for Makoto Shinkai, and I don't think I'll ever see this again unless a friend buys the blu ray, then I'll watch it just for the amazing visuals. If I had to give this film a rating it would be a 6/10. If you want to watch it, then watch it. You'll like it and think it's emotional or whatever. Sorry for thinking differently from you. I'm objectively wrong and everything Makoto Shinkai makes is a 10/10 automatically because it makes you feel like crying. Elfen Lied made me feel like crying for all the wrong reasons, which is why it's also a 10.",6,jumpy
32281,"
                I had the privilege to sit in the front row of the world premiere, and I can only describe this movie as utterly phenomenal. Makoto Shinkai has created a masterpiece. If you remember his Garden of Words, then imagine something that in my opinion is five times better (hyperbole, this will obviously vary from person to person). The movie is not simply an hour-thirty of pretty landscapes and slow burn drama-romance, like in the past. It's a masterpiece.
I never tired of the characters. They are well-developed and Shinkai does an amazing job on slowly and subtly revealing what kind of people the two main characters
                  are. Voice actors also did an amazing job.
Something else I found enjoyable was the comedy. Which Shinkai's works usually lack. I was laughing right at the beginning and even during the parts where I thought were supposed to be serious. It is definitely his most light-hearted, feel-good work but still managed to get me crying shamefully.
The plot is quite fast-paced, something I found fresh considering how calm and quiet Shinkai's movies usually are. There were moments in the movie that felt like actually music videos, and once you watch, you will understand why. Plus, you can't really go wrong with the RADWIMPS, who created songs per Shinkai's request.
Makoto Shinkai has leaped over the successes of his previous films. He has shown us something new, and I would gladly say it's one of the best movies I have ever watched.
To those of you who skipped out on the premiere, what a tremendous shame. To those of you who are eagerly waiting, you won't be disappointed.",10,washinwithwaves

                Mod Edit: this review may contain spoilers.
I have adjectives galore for this movie. For those experienced in Makoto Shinkai filmography, the art and animation are par for the course, but heads and shoulders above what is the next most visually beautiful animated movie you’ve seen.
Had I watched Kimi no na Wa for the scenery, I’d likely have considered it a passable film by Shinkai’s standards (because frankly, Garden of Words was just so much more aesthetically pleasing). However, like Garden of Words, Kimi no na Wa’s characterization and plot range from potently bad to practically non existent.
5 Centimeters per second had a particular air of
                  nostalgia and loss to it that was palpable and painfully relatable. Kimi no na Wa tries to build up on the same premise, but with more of a linear plot, only to fail miserably.
First half was actually tolerable, it worked out just like your typical body switch romcom, which is sad considering the kind of budget and effort that must have went into making the beautiful backdrops come to life. Second half. Oh, the second half!
Whatever semblance of logic that the movie had up until that point was mercilessly crushed and flushed out of the toilet. And then the movie decided to shove a typical sci fi time travel cum disaster prevention plot down our throat, when I thought it couldn’t get any worse.
Sooo, the final product was a body switch slash time travel slash romance slash metaphysical slash philosophical plot that gets zero explanations throughout the movie. Actually, it does; body switch, time goes out of sync, weird dreams, disaster, kids save the day, turns out this has been in the family because comet.
TL;DR, ridiculously overrated pretentious hogwash. Crap like nothing ever was.  Don’t waste your time if you’re looking for a movie that makes sense, but by all means watch it if you’ve seen Shinkai’s drop dead gorgeous art and want more of it.",5,Deiger

                Kimi no na wa, or in english, ""Your name"", is one of the greatest pieces of Japanese works since the creation of sushi.
Before you read this review, I highly recommend you watch the preview and/or read the synopsis for this movie.
Kimi no na wa is a beautiful and incredible movie that seems to be successful in all categories; a movie which would interest even those who don't find the genre interesting. And while the plot idea may not excite some, the setting, characters, and the fantastic work of the director, Makoto Shinka, will cause you to experience a multitude of emotions.
Bittersweet, fascinating, humorous; there are
                  too many words in the dictionary that can describe this movie for me to fit in this one review. Even if you haven't seen the works of  Makoto Shinka, you will come to adore this director for his ability to bring his characters and story to life. 
Whether or not you are watching the movie for enjoyment, or you find yourself more critical of the movie, this work will satisfy both. The characters are enjoyable to watch and they are charming in their own unique way, and while the supporting characters may not in the spotlight, their personalities shine as well.
As a weeab elitist, many ask me what I would pick as my one Japanese work to share or recommend to others, but many that pop into my head fall short in some kind of way. Kimi no na wa, however, is a work of art to remember and will have a lasting effect on the viewer indefinitely. This movie will be sure to stimulate your emotions, cause you to shed a tear or two, and, without a doubt, you will find yourself wearing a dumb smile while watching.
I give Kimi no Na wa a 9/10.",9,dumburro
32281,"
                Kimi No Na Wa is basically visual and audible chocolate to anybody interested in the elements of directing. 
However like chocolate, it doesn't satisfy you at all and only gives you an amazing taste in your mouth for a brief period of time before eventually realize that you're still hungry, and you need something to satisfy you or you'll go hungry.
Kimi no Na Wa fails to give me a good reason to keep my suspension of disbelief because of the fact the plot was just so dreadful and dumb in my eyes, and not because of the fact they're switching bodies it's the reason why
                  they switch bodies that just utterly baffles me because its just full of plot convenience and plot holes that makes me believe that the story was just an afterthought and not necessarily the core of the movie. And I don't want to discuss any more of my frustrations because that would mean I'd have to go into spoiler territory. 
Now the only thing I thought was ok was the characters, Makoto Shinkai always does a great job establishing the atmosphere of each of the characters and does an amazing of contrasting the Urban and Rural lifestyles of the 2 character Taki and Mitsuha. And the way they react once they switch bodies was very charming and funny. 
Overall the movie is impressive visually and musically however the failure for me to understand the emotional distraught that each of the characters faced because of the unbelievable plot conveniences and not to mention the very anti climatic ending was the reason I give this a 6/10",6,Gurrengarterbelt

                Ok, so while I'm writing this review, this son of a gun is at a freaking 9.30 mean score and the new number one anime. Hello??? What??? It's another one of those temporary GOD OF MAL moments, kinda like Erased. Except, this one is actually good!
Kimi no Na wa is my first Shinkai film, so don't expect any comparisons to his other works, like his very popular ""magnum opus"" known as 5cm/s. Thus, expect the mindset of a noob.
Kimi no Na wa is like plate of gourmet french cheese. While still cheesy, it's also got that fanciness that separates it from other plates of cheese.
                  Does that make any sense? Probably not...
In other words, Kimi no Na wa takes the usual stuff that all melodramas have, with the usual side characters, school setting, main characters that are unhappy with their situation, and the wish to have something more. This theme of wanting more is actually one of the few things that was somewhat disappointing for me, as it could have been expanded on to create more emotional attachment to the characters. For example, the main heroine Mitsuha has always wanted to live in the city. Upon transferring to Taki's body for the first time and seeing the city she always dreamed about, yeah it tells us that she's enjoying Tokyo, but it doesn't SHOW us. It's addressed with some simple dialogue, like ""Oh I was overwhelmed by how festive Tokyo is."" I wish it showed us Mitsuha exploring Tokyo, to cement the fact that she loves the city, as well as giving her a reason to look forward to switching with Taki. They probably didn't do this cause time restraints, but honestly, this movie could have been an hour longer and I would have been perfectly fine. Could have helped with the development of the romance more.
That's another aspect that could have been better. The romance. It seemed to just blossom almost out of nowhere. While the romance was expected and understandable, it would have been even more impactful if they showed more interactions between the two main characters. Especially on the guy's side, cause we see all of the development Mitsuha sets up for Taki, but the only thing we really see Taki do (besides the later half of the show) is make Mitsuha seem cooler or something. However, despite all of the possibilities that could have made the romance greater, it was still great nonetheless and extremely emotional.
However, those were really the only qualms I had with the movie, and here is where we get to the fancy part of the french plate of cheese. Unlike other melodramas, who usually hint towards something tragic over a period of time (in a not so subtle), like a deadly illness or something, Kimi no Na wa simply hits you with gut wrenching plot twists that I honestly didn't see coming at all! And the thing is, all of these plot twists WERE foreshadowed, albeit extremely subtly. For example, stuff like the two characters being unable to call each other, or how Taki can't see the comet. All of these things just brush by our brains, because the movie is focusing on all of the character interactions.
The drama may be dealt with beautifully, but even if the drama was subpar, I would still give this show a high score because of the comedy and character interactions. While very simple, the characters in this show are just straight up likable. They are characterized to the point where they are somewhat relatable, but they are by no means deep. Also, I laughed multiple times throughout this movie, especially during the first half an hour or so. The reactions of the main characters after body switching make me chuckle every time, but I also loved how the side characters either just rolled with it, or had very amusing reactions of their own (Mitsuha's little sister was especially hilarious). These comedic moments had a very relaxing vibe and allowed you to just sink into the movie's world, as well as making you none the wiser when all the feelsy parts start happening.
And of course, as with all supernatural-based movies that focus more on the drama rather than the supernatural phenomenon itself, the reason why the body switch happens isn't explained (or just completely flew over my head. I was focusing on the drama, damnit!). But hey, I don't really care.
Hmm, there seems to be something important that I haven't talked about yet. Ah, of course! The cinematography! While I can't compare this film's cinematography to 5cm/s and others, I can still tell that this film's cinematography is legendary. Absolutely beautiful animation that just sucks you into its world, fantastic use of lighting, and of course, some of the best sound in anime. Using nostalgic and soothing rock music, Kimi no Na wa has an atmosphere that will mesmerize you immediately. The cinematography and the sound is probably enough to make some people tear up. Combine that with the well executed drama, and you get this tear jerker.
Unfortunately, Kimi no Na wa suffers from the ""one shot drama"" effect, and by that I mean it relies on unexpected plot twists to drive the drama home. Upon rewatching the show, or god bless your soul you watch it completely spoiled, you'll notice that the drama doesn't feel nearly as impactful. Despite this glaring flaw, the fact that it was able to pull off such a twist and genuinely shock me and so many other viewers during their first watch of this movie is still something to be commended. 
In short, Kimi no Na wa is one of the funniest movies I've seen, while also being one of the saddest, and even one of the most thrilling. It's a bundle of pure emotions, wrapped up in suspense, awe, and bittersweet nostalgia. It's a 2 Volume package, the first half being one of the most chill and entertaining watches in the medium, and the second being a dramatic and satisfying, albeit clusterfucky ride. It's also got some god damn pretty colors.",8,Yuni

                Visually stunning, masterfully written, and amazing performances in animation, sound, and voice acting, ""Kimi no Na wa."" (""Your Name."" in English) is an absolute masterpiece. Makoto Shinkai has once again delivered a piece so beautiful, so heartwarming, so tear-inducing, and in no way less than what you can expect from him. As for those unfamiliar with the name Shinkai, this would be the movie I'd recommend first to watch from him.
I'll be honest that as I walked into the hall at AX to watch the world premier of the movie, my expectations of the film were different. Prior to watching, the supernatural element of the
                  movie never really clicked to me, as I knew Shinkai more for his art of capturing the essence and beauty of a single moment in a slice-of-life setting. When you add supernatural elements in a story, an argument comes up where ""mysticism"" can become favored over ""logic"", and as a result you can make an audience lost over these eccentricities. However, Shinkai made it work. He used the supernatural as a way to amaze the audience and his art further created that mystifying feeling. I found myself so heavily invested in the movie, shaking in my seat as I and many others watched.
Makoto Shinkai is known as being incredibly talented at many things, one being his artwork. The production quality of his work is unparalleled, and as we've seen in the past his art alone is the most visually appealing in the industry. There is a reason why most of us have some sort of desktop wallpaper of Shinkai's works and it is because it truly is that breath-taking. ""Your Name."" may be less focused on art than his previous work ""The Garden of Words"", but that doesn't make it less fascinating than any other piece he created.
Big mentions have to go out to the other names that played a huge role in this movie's production. Masayoshi Tanaka (Toradora, Anohana, Anthem of the Heart) is the character designer of the film. His characters are all visually appealing. Prior to the premier I had no idea he was the character designer, but very quickly I recognized the aesthetics as something familiar. Tanaka's characters are beautiful and full of personality, a definite present for sore eyes no matter which series you watch. The two have collaborated in the past in ""Cross Road"" and I was hoping when I would see that combination again.
Masashi Andou (multiple Ghibli films) is the animation director for the film, and while it is difficult to find distinct characteristics of an animator, you can still see elements of Ghibli-esque animation in ""Your Name."". The most notable would be when you notice a character open their mouth a lot wider than normal, something noticeable in Ghibli films. Aside from that there are some scenes where the animation quality is simply extraordinary: scenes where the use of panning or a hand-drawn 3D camera rotation are used in impressive fashion. It is truly captivating and engaging for the audience.
Radwimps did the music for the film, and while I'm not all too familiar with their music, their songs were exceptional in the movie. During the panel Shinkai mentioned he worked with them for about 2 years to produce the music in a back and forth exchange to fit the mood of the scenes in the movie. That shows massive dedication, and it definitely shows in the film. While you may recognize Tenmon's music direction in ""5 Centimeters Per Second"" best for being as emotionally engaging as it is, Radwimps provide their own craft in ""Your Name."", and it fits the film well for its genre. If I were to give an example, think of Galileo Galilei's OP in ""Anohana"" and how it fits the theme of that series.
Overall, this is a must watch movie from Shinkai. And for anyone relatively new to his films it would be this that I would recommend first. It is incredibly beautiful, and a true masterpiece which is what you can expect from films with a name like Makoto Shinkai. You will find yourself laughing at its humor, mystified by its remarkable art, knees shaking at its high tension scenes, and most notably you will yell 2 particular directional words at the characters as your eyes water during the climax of romance scenes. I can only give the highest recommendation for this film as it is truly Makoto Shinkai's best yet.
As of the time of this review, this film here, ""Your Name."", is Shinkai's magum opus.",10,xNixillis

                While the movie wasn't terrible, I was disappointed because I had high expectations for it. Most of the reviews seem to be overwhelming positive and it is ranked first so I guess most people enjoyed it. However for me, the story lacked alot while the art was outstanding (which is my opinion on most Makoto Shinkai's works). 
STORY
I found the first half of the movie to be enjoyable and after the plot-twist, it kind of went downhill. The sci-fi element wasn't executed very well, alot of the times it felt as if happened all for plot convenience. The time travel and constant body-switching felt too
                  much to me. I admit I was bored in the second half (which was pretty predictable). Also there is alot of inconsistencies which led to confusion. 
ART AND SOUND
Art was amazing and sound was average (left no impression). 
CHARACTERS
The two main characters aren't anything special. They are just your typical female and male lead who want to save everybody. There isn't too much to comment on them because there is nothing beyond them to analyse than what the show directly shows to you. 
The female lead does get a little character development when she becomes more assertive to her father towards the end but honestly that's almost nothing. The minor characters were entertaining but also nothing special.
OVERALL
I think this movie is overrated. Yes, the art is amazing but in terms of plot is is average. For me, it left no impact or anything to think about or feel.",6,dbdasm

                TLDR: Wow.  Everyone is toting this as some masterpiece that could stand up to the giant that is Ghibli when the truth is:  It can't stand up to Ghibli, or even Makoto Shinkai's previous works, or even shows that are coming out yearly. It's not bad, but it's not really good either.
Ok, so I actually drove my ass all the way to Los Angeles to see this for its Oscar screening. The first part of the review will be spoiler free.  One thing that informs my review is that I enjoyed Makoto Shinkai's Garden of Words, and I think anyone who has
                  seen this will have a more informed perspective in which to the watcher.
Skip to the spoiler section if you want to see me be disappointed.
The only part of this movie I consider 10/10 is the music/sound.  The Japanese VA's were nothing special but they didn't detract from anything.  I also didn't notice any sound effects being off.  What really deserves praise here is the musical score. Whenever appropriate, there is a backing track that fits the tone whether it is light or heavy.  I also think being in the movie theater made me appreciate the sound much more, although the cinematic experience of the theater doesn't save this film in other categories.
The art/visuals were not what I was expecting from a Makoto Shinkai work.  You get the beautiful backgrounds and stunning rain effects that are his trademark, but a lot is missing in Kimi no na wa.  The characters and their motions aren't even up to par with shows like Hibike! Euphonium.  It all just screams to me ""standard.""  Noticeable mention goes to a beautiful scene full of spoilers that stands out in its use of color and abstract animation.  Minus points for noticeable and off-putting CG sprinkled throughout the film.
Characters!!!!!  Now here is were the word standard really sets in.  The female gets a lot of screen time but she doesn't come off as anything more than shallow.  The male is a lot more interesting, we even get some subtle characterization. He comes off as standard as the female lead, but doesn't get nearly enough characterization.  All minor characters are truly forgettable, only possible exceptions being the little sister.  The worst part is, after you get acquainted with the characters it is too easy to predict what they are going to do.  Too many times I said ""Oh, because it's the guy in the girl's body this is going to happen.""  I guess it could be praiseworthy to have realistic characters, but I've seen these archetypes before and done better.
Story!!!!!!!!!!  As the story is moved by the characters and vice versa, nothing much else should be said.  The story is predictable.  It tries to jerk your tears, but falls short of other Shinkai works.  There are also a few plotholes that I have detailed in the spoiler section.
SPOILERS/FUN SHIT  I feel like I'm stopping myself of saying anything substantial by avoiding spoilers so here it goes!
OK!! So the theater was filled with dirty-dirty weebs who, I swear, laughed at every cliche we've seen a million times in anime.  The first half of the movie is filled with the most predictable shit I've seen in anime in awhile.  
Guy in the Girl's body?? >> He gropes himself.   The fact that this is a recurring joke and that it tickled all of the weebs in the audience really kills me.
The Girl in the Guy's body?? >> She spends all his money.     I don't care that this is a cliche, I care that this is dull as shit.
I never really found anything in this movie to be funny, at most I was mildly chuckling every 15 or so minutes while everyone around me was guffawing at the social biting commentary that is a girl groping here own tits.
Now for what made me scratch my head.  I don't think the majority of my fellow patrons questioned what was happening in the movie.  If they had they might ask:
Why wouldn't either of them look to see the year that they were in after they swapped bodies?  It is clearly shown that they are keeping calendars and diaries.  Does anyone only write the day and the month in their diary and not the fucking year????
What are the parameters to this ""magic"" that keeps them swapping bodies?  It shows on screen the guy's phone losing its data in real time, so it knows which data to remove? Why?  
And how about the fact that the last two generations of the girl's family have experienced this phenomenon??  They definitely didn't have cell phone apps to write in, so they probably used paper.  Did the paper disappear??  We see that stuff written on the characters' hands doesn't get erased. WHHHHYYYY????
Also the scene where the girl was running back to the town hall or whatever.  She trips and I swear to god she tumbles like twenty fucking feet.  She was jogging at what seemed to be a leisurely pace with like a slight slope.  I had to put my hands on my head because that was so melodramatic I couldn't believe it.",6,Mr900

                I went into this movie with expectations too high as it is highest grossing,#1 on MAL,but in the end it was nothing but disappointment.
The plot is in a total mess throughout the movie.It is like you have to switch off your brain while watching it otherwise you will be questioning about many things happening in the movie probably ruining the experience which happened with me. Both the Characters were mundane.The animation and soundtrack was amazing no doubt.
In the first half itself it was clear that this thing is overrated but  it looked like it will be atmost an enjoyable slice of life. 
But the
                  second half was so bad that I totally lost interest in the movie and ended up waiting for this movie to finish.
So it was not surprising at this getting snubbed at Oscars and the director of the movie himself saying that movie was incomplete and unbalanced.",5,CoreFinder

                I'm 15 and you can definitely listen to my opinion when I say Kimi No Na Wa is the best anime I have ever legally experienced though 100% legitimate means. No pirating sites at all. 
No bullshit, Kimi no Na Wa is about high school kids who switch bodies and their magic connection is the only way to save the day. One lives in Tokyo and the other lives in a hick town. Outside of the major plot, they commute to school, eat food, and talk with friends. Yet, it is all animated in pretty colors. For instance, one of the kids has an iPhone
                  6 or 5 and the animators draw each of the little apps. It's overkill, but pretty neat stuff. 
The characters are absolutely amazing self inserts. It's not that they fit any cliche. Rather, it is just watching the ups and downs of their life that makes them so relatable and realistic. For instance, if you live in a hick town they show all the religious bullshit you deal with: shrines, festival, arts and crafts.If you live in Tokyo, the film shows you are cog in a giant urban machine: taking the subway, eating in crowded cafe. The big budget backgrounds actually tell a story instead of just being a big budget background. 
The film also avoids every cliche of every romance or blockbuster anime you would expect. No Miyazaki shit children. No Wolf Children. No children. No manic pixie dream girls. No ditzy girlfriend. No childhood friend zones. It's just two equally miserable high school kids gender bending bodies thought their dreams.
This anime definitely deserves to be the best anime of all time.",10,AvatarRevy

TL DR review: Solid all around romance movie. Not Shinkai's best but comes a close second. A Must watch. 
Section wise review: Story: 
Its a Shinkai film, meaning there will be a love story with a twist. 5cm/second had themes of love and effect distance can have over it. Garden of words had love between a student and his teacher while in Place promised, childhood friends took different paths as time progressed but were drawn back by a promise made during their early years. 
Here we have a love story which starts off with body swapping but eventually becomes across different time periods. Its told in a sort of a non-linear way. The closest film I can think of with a similar plot is the Sandra Bullock starring Premonition. 
Art: 
It's a Shinkai film. That really should be certificate enough. The scenes are dripping with detail. Shinkai has a knack of taking everyday, normal stuff and making them seem magical. A simple train ride can be made to appear to be out of a fantasy setting and here it is no different. There is a section in the story called ""Kuchikamizake Trip"" which is hauntingly beautiful. Like ""making of cyborg""/parade scene in GITS/Innocence or the classroom destruction scene from Aku no hana, the scene stays with you long after you have seen the film. 
Sound:
The music was an eye-opener. Music in other Shinkai's works hadnt really impressed me and I always thought of it as a weak link. No more, the songs here are truly breathtaking. Some of these songs, I will add to my playlist. My fav songs are Kuchikamizake Trip and Kataware Doki. 
Character: 
Here is where I feel the movie could have slightly been improved. Bear in mind that these are mostly nitpicks on my side. I feel Mitsuha got a better character arc than Taki. Taki was just some guy in Tokyo who had a crush on his sempai from work. His family status, his friends and other details about him were generally left open for interpretation. Mitsuha got a good character arc but towards the ending the entire confrontation with her father curiosly occurred off-screen. We were just told that Mitsuha's father finally believed her and got the villagers to safety. Kind of a cop-out IMO. It wasnt organic. 
Enjoyment: 
Nothing to complain here. Strangely I even liked the usually jarring j-pop songs Shinkai uses in his films.
Overall: 
It doesnt approach the greatness of subtle storytelling that 5cm/second employed but in terms of Shinkai's works, it is a very, very close second.",8,ndsempai

                It is one of those typical cases of the internet, they are talking very well, it should be great, sure will be great, 2 hours later ... ???????
How so this is greatly overestimatedBeginning of the story very complicated you take to get the essence, only after a few tens of minutes watching you can distinguish between Mitsuha and Taki, the story would have a legal outcome, I thought they could overcome the barrier of time, but I was sure That it would not be like this, had high expectations, I was very distressed watching this movie, I must say because they take so long to
                  meet, it's a movie you have few minutes or hours to give an end to the story, now have an end like The one in which the character meets her and ends at the apex of the ""flag"" I think it was slutty, well I can say I liked the movie, but not that I was satisfied can watch and enjoy the movie, I even recommend however if you have anxiety That would not be a good idea...
I must also emphasize that this is my own opinion, now I must ""take my hat"" to the design of the characters, the art and also the soundtrack that are great
Certainly worth it in aspects ...
Well I did not get much benefit from having high expectations for people's feedback, but I think it was a bit overrated, but if you're looking for something to watch with romance and drama and a good choice, because I'm not much of a fan of romance, but History holds you, makes you accompany every moment in ecstasy and also agunstiar with waiting for the damn encounter!
Story: Only a few tens of minutes for you to understand, and also know who is in the body of who
Art: Just wonderful
Sound: Voices of the actors have been well chosen, the soundtrack is contagious
Character: They do not seem so natural, the co-stars can play a better role than the protagonist. It came to be somewhat forced such changes, without any explanation
There were times when I asked where I was.
*where I am?*
Enjoyment: I watched with a friend who has little knowledge, I had to stop the movie at all times to try to explain what I understood of the scene, there were moments that I was lost.
Also because I did not understand what was happening at the moment *SIGH*

I grade this film a D which is probably the fairest review you'll ever find on this website. If you'll humor me, I'd like to explain why.
I'm under the impression that the popular grading system here is fundamentally flawed; in that Art, Sound and 'Enjoyment' (wtf? this isn't even quantifiable) is equally as important as Story and Acting. Any professional/rational critic will tell you its just silly to allocate 50% of a film's
                  success purely to sound and filmography as shown in this simple though exercise. 
Is it not much easier to think of examples where good acting (characters) or Plot alone have created a film we would remember and love ... despite average music or filmography? But let us be honest now, sensational filmography and sound cannot create a masterpiece from mediocre plot. I think the essence of why quite unoriginal films like this can place #1 is because of this imbalance and dishonest grading system. Anyone who gave this film anything higher than a 7 has done so because 
   1. They don't care for artistic integrity or originality and aren't afraid to vote from emotional relief without justification. The 'Enjoyment' grading perfectly demonstrates how critically flawed grades are. What even the point of rating Story, Art, Sound and Character all of which can be quantified through stimulus ... but 'enjoyment' cannot and appeals only to mood which distorts your ratings accuracy. Enjoyment and Overall make one another redundant, and in this unspecific, but mandatory rating excess ... the entire rating becomes warped.
     2. They haven't seen any one of the many highly identical  films/characters.
Since when did the standard for top #1 fall so low that recycled characters and not too distant plots can win awards. I'd implore you to explore the tag-links within the Genre categorisation. Does a piano/violin and guitar music piece accompanied by above-standard (to TV series) art - really make it a recipient of such a high creative honor?
   3. They think music and a few distracting moments of sweeping art (but mainly impressive editing) is just as/if not more important to plot. 
Even if just one person reads this, I will feel graced. I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for the power of rational and constructive criticism that constantly cleanse me of my stubborn ways.

                With all of the praise this movie has gotten it's no surprise that it is fairly well done movie. Unlike some other movies that are all style and no substance this does have good writing as well as good art, but it isn't exactly a masterpiece either.
The first half of the movie establishes the two main characters and their relationship with each other and because of the way it's set up explaining the second half would have to lead to spoilers. The story is done well and despite the short run time it does manage to tell a complete story. One hindrance the duration does
                  impose is the lack of time to explain the two fantastic phenomena that the plot revolves around. The full story was unexpected given the beginning, but it would have been better as an ecchi comedy otherwise.
As one would expect from a Makoto Shinkai film the art is amazing. The characters look beautiful, the backgrounds are detailed, and generally everything looks amazing. The detail of the scenery actually is important to the plot, but even if it weren't it would be just as spectacular.
The voice actors do a very good job, which is important since the characters will switch roles every so often. The music is nice to listen to, but it isn't always all that fitting with the situation and sometimes it feels like there's a random AMV in the middle of the anime without much reason.
The two main characters are both quite interesting. It's fun to see how they react to the situations they get into while in the other person's shoes. There is a line from one character that brings into question just how common their problem is and why no one else seems to know about it, but unfortunately the anime isn't long enough to give us answer to this.
Although not everything makes complete sense, you don't have to turn your brain off to enjoy this. The second half is rather chaotic so the plot itself gives you enough to think about that you might not even notice the plot holes. This also isn't something that only a niche audience can enjoy so there's a pretty good chance you will like it. The incredible art adds to the enjoyment.
Overall it's a pretty good film. The art was amazing and the rest didn't feel too far behind it. There were some problems, but they are all relatively easy to overlook. With all things considered it was a good watch.",7,zombie_pegasus

                *contains spoilers*
Let’s begin with the positives. The animation is on point, and the dialogues are beautiful. There certainly are touching moments in the anime, which even managed to move a person like me. So I get why people are so hyped about this anime.
Unfortunately, I went in with decent expectations and while the movie certainly was a decent watch, it wasn’t as outstanding as I thought it would be. For starters, I guess the one of the bigger reason the Western world is so impressed with this movie was because of how beautifully it portrayed Japanese tradition and culture, both of which the US lacks
                  (culture and tradition). Second, I come from a country where themes like reincarnation, fate, karma etc are very common and used a lot in our movies, so I guess that was another reason these themes in the movie didn’t impress me as much. 
And also, I guess it didn’t impress me as much because I’m 29 and clearly, the movie was aimed at school children. I’ll bet that if you look up the other reviews of maybe 70% of the reviewers who gave this movie 8+ ratings, you’ll see that they have also given anime like Angel Beats, Yuri on Ice and Re: Zero very good ratings as well. This simply goes on prove that the movie resonated well with its *target* audience – Americans and school children.
Coming to the negatives, there were certain things that just didn’t make sense or I didn’t like about the movie:
# Aren’t animators tired of putting school children in such, well, adult situations?
# The first 30 minutes where all that happens is body switching. Slowed down the pace considerably. Also, Freaky Friday much? The only reason I pushed beyond those 30 minutes was because I wanted to see what was so great about this movie
#And then suddenly within the span of next 2 minutes, the boy and girl have come up with schedules of how to manage their switches, and then the plot starts focusing on other aspects of the movie. Erm, okay. I would have preferred if the confusion about the switching was kept for maybe 10 minutes and the remaining 20 minutes was devoted to how they managed their schedules with each other. Would have paved way for a lot funny/cute scenes.
# The first 40 minutes it's about body switching and the two liking each other, and then BAM. She's dead. I liked that plot twist, but it didn't really flow smoothly with the plot. And after that, of course, the tone of the movie changed and everything became about finding/meeting her. Kinda like two movies mashed into one.
# The Another+Noragami feel when it came to the memory lapses, which by the way were never explained. If those two could remember about each other for 2-3 days at a stretch when in between switching their bodies, then why did they suddenly just forget about the existence of each other when the swapping stops?
# WHY does the body swapping+time travel happen? Never explained. Poor story writing.
# I don’t understand how Mitsuha’s friends just went along with her plan of evacuating the village without any *real* evidence given by her
# Why wasn’t Taki more confused (like Mitsuha was) when he first swapped bodies with her? He seemed too chill with his environment.
# What’s up with Mitsuha’s boob jiggle? Unnecessary+cheapened the movie’s experience for me.
# I don’t know how old these two are – 14 or 18? Your guess is as good as mine.
In conclusion, I have to say that I *might* have enjoyed the movie more if I were 16. But I’m not, so yeah, it’s only a decent watch, according to me. Nothing beyond that, much like Yuri on Ice and Re: Zero.

Kimi no Na wa is Makoto Shinkai's latest work that has been well-received so far to the point of being over-hyped. While I don't see this as a masterpiece, it has a lot of strong points and at the same time has weak points as well. First off, the premise is not that original yet it still tries to grab the viewer's interest. I like how the body-switching gimmick is handled with a sense of realism in it. For example, an individual's natural curiosity towards the opposite sex and also how the voice actors of the protagonists handle the role of a person trapped
                  inside a body of an opposite sex very well. As the story progress the two protagonists know that they must set ways to deal with the problematic situation such as leaving notes before they switch back to normal which I find quite creative. Accompanied with the Shinkai standard visuals and soundtrack, the overall atmosphere of the movie is lighthearted.
On the weaker side of things, the movie takes a blow by the introduction of time-travel elements in the second half of the story. The lighthearted atmosphere gradually grow intensely into an emotional rollercoaster. I like plots that tend to be intense and emotional but the way the movie transitions the atmosphere is kinda off-putting. As the movie absorbs you into its change of atmosphere, there is a noticeable inconsistency in pacing. It's probably because the time-travel makes it sort of convoluting. The flow of time and memory begins to distort. There are plot points that, while emotionally packed, are hard to take seriously. It takes a while for the suspension of disbelief to sink in at the idea of switching not only with bodies but also with timelines. 
Now why the score of 8 out of 10 when I've been addressing quite the heavy complaint? While the second half starts to crumble the strong start the movie has, I still enjoy and love the movie overall. The ending is satisfactory that, despite having traces of forcefulness to it, is a good change of storytelling in comparison to his previous works such as 5 Centimeters Per Second where there is no definite resolution like a happy ending. I do think that the movie deserves credit for trying to do more with its story despite being partly a failure and a success. Unlike Shinkai's previous films that tend to be overwhelmingly melancholic and distant, Kimi no Na wa assimilates the feeling of a passionate youth which I really like and find beautiful. I like the contrast of the two settings albeit I hoped for a better world-building. I kind of blame myself for having a soft spot for these kinds of coming-of-age stories. The production is great from the gorgeous visuals to the heartwarming soundtrack. I believe that Shinkai can still put out better projects given that his story writing ability has more consistency and substance to it. Whatever the consensus is, this movie will definitely leave an impact to the curious viewer.",8,BlueKite

                While it is visually and artistically creative and pleasing, the basic plot is un-enjoyably slow, and the characters are dull and unimaginative. I had high hopes for this after hearing all the hype around it, but unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. Maybe it's just not for me, and I can respect that, but nonetheless it was not an enjoyable watch.
Contrary to many people's opinion, I personally thought much of the plot was senseless and unnecessary. To add to this, the characters introduced are unimaginably dull, and their personality seems to be about as vibrant as a sheet of paper.

                Alright to start this review off, I'm going to be overly critical. This movie has been over-hyped to hell. That said, this is by no means a bad movie. In fact this movie is absolutely incredible, just not the Otaku-culture ending, divine master work that everyone seems to be making it out to be. So I'm going to break things down for you while avoiding as many spoilers as possible.
Story (8):  The story was pretty good. It followed a pretty unique genre that isn't given much attention to in mainstream media. The pacing was quite good throughout the entire movie. However, to those of
                  you looking for a more impact inducing thriller type experience i suggest you look elsewhere as this movie is bound to bore you. This movie is filled with drawn out scenes designed to help you feel the atmosphere of the film and focuses less on huge ground-breaking events. 
I don't count this as a spoiler, as i'm sure you're already aware of this, but this movie is a romance. My main issue with this story is this: The romance seems to bloom out of nowhere, with almost no indication of it occurring. Because of this, the story gives a very forced romance cliche feeling. Because of this it was very difficult to empathize with the characters and their emotions throughout the film. 
Art (10): The art of this anime is absolutely insane. Every aspect about it is breath-taking. From backgrounds to character design the art is flawless. The art shows off the tranquility of the country side and the hectic lifestyle of the busy city perfectly.  The animation runs like silk, coupled with brilliant and realistic character design. 
Sound (9): The voice acting is wonderful. The sound effects throughout this movie is perfect. As the movie progresses, you encounter multiple songs coupled by montages that grace the movie perfectly. Some of the most brilliant moments in this movie are coupled along side the emotion filled songs.    
Character (10): Every character is designed realistically and perfectly. This movie happily moves away from the ""useless otaku"" character genre the has permeated anime so deeply. It does this by giving the main character actual skill and a bright future. Throughout the movie, no character is left without development.  You even begin to grow attached to minor characters as the movie progresses. 
Enjoyment (9): I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, i would easily consider this my second favorite anime movie to date. I look forward, to when this movie arrives on the shelves as i will be happily purchasing it.   
Overall, I give this movie a 9.16. Almost everything about this movie was expertly done. From the art to the character development there are very little issues to be found. Again, the biggest issue i feel this movie suffers from is the over-hype surrounding it. The only other issue is the forced romance feeling this movie gives off. While the movie is well paced, despite its drawn-out atmospheric scenes, the movie still feels that it speeds by any chance to show any actual feelings beginning to grow between the main characters. Quickly jumping from ""I just met you"" to ""I love you"" gives the only unrealistic feeling in this whole film.  
All of that said, I highly suggest you watch this great film.",9,coausti
32281,"
                Makoto Shinkai is a director that clearly loves the idea of ""star-crossed lovers"", ""love at first sight"" and the idea that once you fall in love, even as children, that you will be dedicated to that person forever even if circumstances change or the people in love change. In most of his previous films the characters fall in love instantly and we spend the rest of the film watching them pine over the other wishing that they could be together, even if decades have gone by without being in contact with each other. The clearest example of this is in 5cm Per Second where the
                  protagonist simply cannot move on from a crush he had as a child on a close friend. Nevertheless, in The Garden of Words, there was a sense of growth in Shinkai as we get to actually see the main characters develop their relationship on screen. But, it still ends in the same way as the other Shinkai films with the protagonist pining for his lost love. I had hope that Shinkai would build on this growth with Your Name, to give even more depth and understanding of romance and love, however all this film gave me was disappointment.
Before delving into this disappointment, I want to mention the outstanding animation, backgrounds and sound design in Your Name. This is perhaps the cleanest looking film I've seen thus far. It is easy to be absorbed into the world of Your Name due to how well the film is presented. I would argue that Your Name is even better than 5cm Per Second in terms of visuals.
Now, while I could go on about the visuals, at the end of the day the purpose of these visuals is to tell a story, and here the story fails. On the surface, the initial plot to Your Name seems like it could work. The trailers covered the first half of the story, where the characters have to overcome their predicament of switching bodies every so often. Then comes the plot twist and from there, everything falls apart. 
SPOILERS FROM HERE
Somehow, these characters are not only switching bodies, but they are also traveling through time. Yet, somehow they never realise they are traveling through time. This makes no sense at all. The characters would have picked up on this almost immediately through simply looking at their phones. But no, we're meant to believe that these characters are that stupid that they didn't realise what the date was every time they switched bodies. Both characters are then surprised when they try to find the other and notice the time difference. Mitsuha doesn't even question the idea that Taki is a few years younger in her timeline. This leads to the crisis where they need to change the past to save Mitsuha's town. 
The rest of the film dealing with the evacuation of the town is ridiculous. At the very least they could have had a scene where Mitsuha opens up to her friends about the whole time travel thing to make things feel a bit more grounded, but instead they jump straight in to blowing up the power plant. The main conversation that is meant to convince the mayor to evacuate the town is done off screen, so we don't even get to see how Mitsuha has grown as a character in standing up to her father. Nevertheless, this is not as poorly handled as the main story of the film; the romance between our protagonists.
The biggest question I have for this film is this; at what point do these characters fall in love? During the first half of Your Name they are casually dealing with the body switching problem, then during the second half of the film they're in love. At no point do we get to see them doing anything that would lead to any romantic feelings developing. The only explanation we have is the usual for Shinkai; that they were destined to be in love even if they barely know each other. The worst part of this portrayal of romance is that when they finally get to have a discussion with each other, Taki just writes ""I love you"" on Mitsuha's hand instead of his god damn name so she can't even remember who he is. Then we're meant to assume that many years later, even after forgetting all the events that happened, that these two characters were waiting for each other to fall in love again. These people barely know each other, have almost no chemistry, and what they did learn about each other they forgot due to amnesia. It seems like Shinkai read Romeo and Juliet and assumed that's how a successful romantic relationship works and completely missed the point that its a tragedy about stupid teenagers making terrible decisions because they decided they are in love after barely knowing each other. 
It seems that Shinkai still has no idea how relationships work. Your Name falls in to the same category as the rest of his films where the main characters are in love forever and we're meant to feel sad when they long for each other for years/decades. This view is simply too naive to be taken seriously. I can't recommend this to anyone unless you view love like Shinkai does.",4,myronator

                I, like countless others, have been hearing a fairly constant stream of praise and hype for Makoto Shinkai's supposed be-all-end-all of anime. I was never a huge Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood fan, but seeing a movie about teenage romance (at least, so far as I was aware at the time) surpass it handily for the #1 spot on MAL was still a bit of a shock. After that, it was record and awards out the gates for months without so much as a glimmer of the actual product.
Now, finally, I've had the chance to watch it. I went into it obviously expecting it to not be
                  the be-all-end-all of anime, half because I find the concept ridiculous and half because anything that appeals so well to such a wide audience is unlikely to strike a very specific chord with me in particular. It's just hard to be universal and personal at the same time, and that's just dandy. Kimi no Na wa is a blockbuster and a family movie first and foremost, which is a tricky enough task in and of itself. Getting an emotional reaction out of millions of people is no easy task! So, here I am, both to try to halt the hype train a little bit and to give the movie the recognition that it very much does deserve.
Let's start with the hard truth. This isn't the greatest anime, movie, or anime movie ever made. The hype surrounding this work is borderline poisonous, and anyone who actually believes it is bound to be disappointed. Even from a technical standpoint, it isn't perfect. I appreciated the pacing of its individual scenes, but it could've afforded to add up to 20 minutes of content to the first half to better establish the status quo and a few of the characters. Almost all of the animation is creative and immersive, with spinning shots and dynamic scenes, but because of this the few deadpan scrolls present felt woefully out of place, like they belonged to a Pokemon showdown. The main characters are fundamentally likable but not especially complex, and most of the side characters feel like they exist primarily to support the movie's thematic objectives. This movie might change your life, but it definitely isn't going to change everyone's life and it isn't going to go down in the halls of film history as a masterpiece. I know many people who haven't seen it probably already suspect as much, but here's confirmation: Kimi no Na wa is remarkable, but it isn't mind-blowing. The anime community has a tendency to overreact. It happens.
There, that's out of the way. Let's move on to the positive part.
Kimi no Na wa is, I believe, an extremely important film in this day and age. In a world where the only internationally and even domestically respected anime comes from Studio Ghibli, a studio who's iconic creator Hayao Myazaki is in his twilight years no matter how many times he comes out of retirement, having a new, widely-successful film made by a new studio and a new director is fantastic. Sure, those of us deep in the rabbit hole have seen the wonderful works of Masaaki Yuasa or Satoshi Kon, but none of those ever made big enough waves worldwide to cement their creators as household names. Beyond this though, all of the aforementioned directors work(ed) in ways that oftentimes seem to differentiate themselves from what many anime viewers would consider ""anime"". Outside of a love for fantasy and sci-fi, few of the tropes and traits that in many ways help to define anime as a genre are found in Myazaki's films, much less Yuasa or Kon. Which brings us to my central point, and what I believe to be Kimi no Na wa's greatest triumph:
Kimi no Na wa is anime.
It's the anime you know and love (or hate with a burning passion). It's got the tropes, the character types, the insert songs, the OP, the fantasy elements, the tried-and-true rom-com elements and sex jokes and blushing and high school and little sisters and tender emotional moments. It has all the usual, but it presents them in a way that is tasteful and cohesive and well-executed, taking so much of the stuff you'd find in your 20-a-season grab-bag of anime goodies and turning it into something that you can actually sit down to watch with your family. As I briefly mentioned already, Shinkai has a sense of pacing and comedic timing that most anime either lack or sacrifice for the sake of filling an episode, and it shows. Purely on a scene-to-scene basis the movie is enjoyable to watch, because it's fast and snappy and it never points at its own jokes. Kimi no Na wa also has all the bizarre-ness of an anime storyline. What starts out as a pretty simple Freaky Friday premise evolves into something much grander and unexpected. I've always strongly believed that a great way to keep a movie engaging is for it to have two parts: the premise, or what gives the audience something to hold onto, and the turn, a half-way shift that draws a new conflict out of the original set-up and puts what's already happened into perspective. For example Howl's Moving Castle begins with Sophie getting transformed into an old lady and embarking on a journey to reverse her curse, but as the movie goes on the focus turns to the horrific war that Sophie learns is destroying her country. Kimi no Na wa does an impeccable job at implementing this technique--just when I was beginning to fall into a rhythm and started subconsciously solving the rest of the events of the movie, it pulled on a new face and kept me on my toes until the very end. It's a film that, despite its Hollywood structure and execution, isn't afraid to get its nose out of the books when it comes to the actual content. It's not just what the story is, either: the presentation is delightful, jumping forward when it chooses and filling in the details of events later for impact, a tactic that is so very anime.
Shinkai's directing also does something important: we've all heard that the movie is drop-dead gorgeous, and it is, but even more important than that Shinkai demonstrates why this specific story should be an anime, and not live action. His repeated emphasis on closing doors, for example, is impactful due to the extreme exaggeration of the perspective. And his use of thought bubbles above character's heads, as if in a cartoon, is a choice afforded him only because of the medium. Shinkai also maximizes his use of human expressions, something that live footage cannot replicate due to the limitations of the human face. Because we often envision ourselves hyperbolically, watching characters make faces or strike poses that are legitimately impossible actually makes sense to us. Even the music is discernibly anime; a tag-team of touching instrumentals and empowering rock songs complement all the movie's significant moments, pulling on that fundamental hunger for fantastic animation set to catchy music that drives so many anime fans. And, as I mentioned earlier, there's even an OP, a la Rebellion style. Who doesn't love a good OP? There's nothing like vague plot-hints sowed together into a colorful two-minute music video to get me excited about what I'm about to watch, and I mean that with complete sincerity. And, if you weren't convinced by all of this, the movie even has the audacity to open with a boob gag. I haven't seen a move that bold since Bakemonogatari. Fortunately it actually managed to fit right into what the story was doing and not feel remotely voyeuristic, but the fact of the matter stands: only pure, unfiltered anime would open with a girl freaking out over her chest.
So why is it so important that Kimi no Na wa is anime? Well, regardless of its actual merits, I firmly believe that this movie marks a new era for the medium. Shinkai has shown that pure, well-crafted anime can turn heads internationally, and people across the world are seeing that perhaps anime has more to offer than just Disney-dubbed Myazaki movies. I see the film as a sort of bridge, a piece of work that enamors anime fans and average people alike without sacrificing any of the things that make anime what it is. I think it's also helping to remind a lot of people why they got into anime in the first place. In an era where people keep insisting that anime is dying, seeing the fundamentals executed so well in a brand-new way has to mean something. We may not get another End of Evangelion or Ghost in the Shell for a little while, but for me at least getting to watch two hours of the medium I fell in love with prove that it can produce something that is thoroughly and completely competent and enjoyable made me quite glad, and considering Shinkai's dismissal of his own work I find myself excited to see what he'll create next. An artist who's never content with that they create can go great places.
So yeah, at the end of it all, I'd say it's well-worth the watch. The movie is a spectacle, and you're unlikely to find yourself bored even if you don't find yourself particularly emotionally impacted (like myself.) I predict it will have a significant impact on the future of anime, I give it a hearty recommendation, and I hope that because of this review at least a few more people will go into with enough sensibility to fully enjoy it.",7,ChrissyKay

                Since this movie is currently sitting at the number 1 spot for all time top rated anime on this website, I assumed a large portion of you had already seen this movie, so this review will contain spoilers. 
Now that I got that out of the way, let’s just jump right into it.
Kimi no na wa is Makoto Shinkai’s latest movie, the story follows a guy named Taki and a girl named Mitsuha begins to switch bodies because, well, reasons. The first half of the movie is just your typical Slice of Life comedy that involves characters switching bodies. For the most part, it was
                  harmless, until they tries to be something else in the second half.
The huge plot twist of this movie is that apparently Taki is not just switching bodies with mitsuha, but he’s apparently went 3 years back in time before Itomori (the village that mitsuha’s living in) got destroyed by a comet. 
Now now now, where do I even begin with all of this nonsense. So, apparently Taki was time travelling back in time the whole time yet, he didn’t realize that he was actually sent back to 3 years before the present? Hello? Am I the only one who noticed how stupid it was? 
How could Taki didn’t notice that he was time travelling back in time despite the fact that he was using mitsuha’s phone to write a diary? Uhm, I’m sorry but as far as I know every fucking phone in this entire goddamn planet tells you the current date and time AT THE TOP ON ITS FUCKING SCREEN, HOW DOES TAKI AND MITSUHA DIDN’T EVEN NOTICE THE SIMPLEST THING SUCH AS THAT?
Oh yeah I get it, because if they actually realized it right away the whole thing where Taki goes to meet mitsuha in person and found that she was actually dead long time ago wouldn’t be as dramatic as it would be if they didn’t realize it. Once again, anime is treating its viewers like some kind of retard, not so suprising eh? 
I don’t really mind about how they didn’t explain the whole body switching works. But to completely ignore logic just for the sake of being dramatic is beyond unforgivable. 
Well aside from the incoherent plot this movie excels at the presentation. Its really gorgeous and the colours are vivid. The show composition were great but that doesn’t hide the fact that the story was a complete mess.  If I'd to rate this movie solely because of the Presentation alone, it would be 8 or higher, sadly, the plot is a huge turn off for me that not even pretty colours could change my opinion about the movie.
As for the characters they’re completely forgettable and there’s nothing really stand out about them. The one thing that I don’t get is Taki and Mitsuha’s relationship. Just because you swapped bodies doesn’t mean that you have to fall in love with each other, their relationship has literally no chemistry whatsoever, even Taki and his coworker relationship makes more sense than him being with Mitsuha. 
There are more things to cover about this movie but I think this would be enough. 
In short, Kimi no na wa is far from what you can call a “Masterpiece”. But if you can ignore everything and just literally “turn your brain off” I can see why someone would like it. But as for me, I could not just overlook how stupid this movie is.",4,FarrelSal
32281,"
                Okay, I'm pretty sure anyone seeing this score would be shocked. To be honest, I was shocked first, by how popular this movie is. Today, everyone knows about Your Name. It was such a huge hit, even outside Japan. But really, aside from the visuals, there is literally nothing worth mentioning.
STORY
Everyone had this thought once : ""I wish I had a chance to change my life!"". This movie plays on that, by showing the story of two young people (a boy and a girl) who somehow switch with one another and live the other's life. First confused, they then get a hold of the situation
                  and even manage to communicate through written messages, thus organizing their weird life.
Then, the story takes a dramatic turn when we learn that a comet is coming and may erase an entire town from the surface of the Earth (and as it happens, this is the village of one of the MCs).
So, what's wrong with that?
- First, I hate it when a story has two different plots but these aren't really linked with each other. Whenever the two stories can be taken separately, it means it failed to merge together. If you have to make several stories into one, make sure they converge in a coherent way.
- Then, I know it's just a story and I may be overthinking it, but the story as it is told is just full of plot holes, which make it totally unbelievable. Long story short : THERE IS NO ANSWER TO ANY MYSTERY. Why are these two people switching places? What exactly is this comet? Why does any of this happen? Basically, everything happens because DESTINY. And that's all. Everything is bound to happen, so it happens, end of story.
- Finally, worst of all : the love story is not believable at all. I mean, those two characters wind up falling in love, but they haven't even met!
ART
On that point, there isn't anything to blame. Well, I do have one thing to say : the animation wasn't as smooth as people pretend it is. It was globally clean, but there were several times where I found the motions quite unnatural. The same for the light effects : they were beautiful, but I didn't find them natural enough.
SOUND
I literally remember NOTHING, not even one track.
CHARACTER
As it is just a short movie, there is simply no time to introduce or develop the characters. As a result, we can't really blame the secondary characters for being one-dimensional and not interesting.
What I do blame is the fact that even the MCs are average. They have literally no particular trait. This was probably intended, so I guess that is not really a problem. The real problem is : since they have nothing particular, why would this story happen to THEM specifically? There's gotta be a reason for destiny to choose them, right?
ENJOYMENT
I did enjoy the visuals, but aside from that, I retain literally nothing from Your Name. A lot of it is way too ordinary to be interesting, and the parts which are unusual are full of plot holes, as the main mysteries are answered only by the typical answer ""sh*t up, it's destiny"".
That said, Your Name can be an emotional ride if you get in. I guess this is why it's so popular, and I (kinda) get it. I personally can't enjoy a story if it makes no sense.",3,Dante012
32281,"
                A disappointment. Shinkai has never failed to not impress me. With characters as flat as cardboard and a story that could have been mastered by a five year old, Your name has positive ratings and that fact has baffled me to no end. I shall now proceed with my review, but I advise you to be cautious as my thoughts might offend you greatly. 
Story: 
An absolutely wonderful story (sarcasm) filled with so many plotholes and contradictions you might feel your head burst, not to mention the constant avoidance of explaining even the most bizarre occurances, leaving many to just say, ""Well, it's magic!"" Where
                  shall I begin?
1) A huge meteorite is going past earth. A chunk of it breaks and hurtles towards Earth. If one takes basic science into consideration, this comet ought to have disintegrated upon entering the Earth's atmosphere, but it didn't and the movie left us cursing the japanese government merely because of the fact that it wont take a genius to at least be AWARE of a giant meteorite that can't be burned down (We're in the twenty first century. Are you implying that you have no sorts of telescopes to at least observe a comets size and determine whether it's gonna burn up or not?) can be a huge threat. Apparently, this comet can cause a body switching to occur. We have no explanation to why this happens, it's just because of magic.
2. Two people switch bodies with eachother and have not at least attempted to check their surroundings (Because body switching is not suspicious.) They continue disrupting eachothers lives while ignoring the possibilities and danger, as shown by the mere fact the boy does not even know where the girl lives for fucks sake (He needed to use his scetches to determine where she lived). No one tries to bother checking the year and none of them even notice the year by newspapers, articles, calenders or even fucking cellphones.
3. After the timetravel happens, we have a brief flash of Mitsuha remembering the comet that hit her. We have no explanation as to why she remembered all of a sudden but it just happened. Magic! ! ! 
4. How can Taki and Mitsuha not even remember their names after they've met eachother before twilight? (the part where Mitsuha has to evacuate everybody and has gone to the ruins to find Taki.) I posted this on reddit a few hours ago and many comments refuted me and claimed that they were in a dreamlike state (I have realised never to share opinions on reddit, but that's another story.) However, we can clearly see that Taki has a perfect and detailed memory of Itomori, as shown in his drawings. Was remembering Mitsuha's name such a difficulty for him? Why? And why did he forget it on that exact moment? 
5) When Mitsuha goes to the train at 2013, why hadn't she noticed the fact that Taki was younger? Considering that both had vivid memories (as displayed by Taki's art), why can't she at least not see that he's different? She was able to find him familiar at the end of the movie, despite having nearly all of her memories about him lost (She could not even remember his fucking name). For someone her age it would not be a huge feat to realise that something is wrong with her boyfriend. Speaking of boyfriends....
Characters 
So far the only things I can say about Mitsuha and Taki is that Taki is boyish and full of anger (I needed to know this by the waitress' remarks) while Mitsuha is girly and cares for everyone. You might argue that the movie had a limited screentime but that theory was refuted many times as displayed by Disney's Lion King, Mulan, Frozen and Miyazaki's Howl Moving castle (Though the only characters who I thought deserved the title of well round and interesting was the Witch and Calcifer.) The romance between them is quite forced as shown by the mere fact that none of them even know where they live. A body switching is not sufficient enough to cause such a deep attraction, and while the attraction would be understandable if both characters had amazing qualities that would make anyone love them, having a normal and boring past is not going to do much.
Animation
The art style was wonderful. The animation? Not so much. It starts of smooth and compelling and ends up so rigid in a matter of seconds that one would feel cheated just by looking at it. I appreciate the part where Mitsuha's mother is looking at her newborn but other than that not a single moment deserved a shoutout. The animation was average at best.
Music:
The music was not that great either. A generic soudtrack to be honest. I found it quite annoying that they placed a song in several crucial moments, like when Mitsuha is trying to evacuate everyone and a generic love songs pops up. Your character is on the verge of dying and the fate of everyone is in her hands, everyone in the movie theater is holding their breaths, what do you do? Pop a singer here.
Atmosphere
The moments between Taki and Mitsuha were awkward, and a bunch of unnecessary moments were stuffed in here and there. An example could include the part where Taki in Mitsuha's body is racing towards the cliff and the camera shows the back view of Mitsuha's skin as the skirt flies up and down. Not the best moment when you're trying to save everyone. Not to mention the sudden tantrum Taki had just because he forgot Mitsuha's name, or Mitsuha falling down while running towards her father's office (Note, this is the part where the meteorite is hurtling toward Earth) only to stare at her hand and sob as she forgets Takis name. I was extremely pissed when they build a lot of suspense for the final confrontation between Mitsuha and her father only to cut it off and forget about it.
Enjoyment:
It's quite a feat for such a simple movie to crush people's attention and cause such misconception. The explanation of what is going on is tossed here and there, leaving the viewer confused and baffled. It might be due to the contradiction, as shown above (Having vivid memories at one moment but then forgetting names at the other) or merely the language barrier but nevertheless I was not compelled to rewatch this monstrosity. I would have rated this movie a bit lower had I not been entertained for the 20 minutes after the first hour but the ending made me check my watch due to how slow it was. Speaking of slow, the movie has a habit of dragging on and on and when something does happen it feels so rushed one can bearly make out what they're saying.

HELL YEAH IT CAN",5,antohachan
32281,"
                By no means is this a bad anime, however it is far from worthy of the number one spot on MAL. The story is well-written and one of the most well-structured anime I have seen in a while, however the story itself is quite lacking in that it doesn't show enough character development. The concepts that the director have instilled in the characters are very pronounced and admirable, however it is belief that others see this as true character development. Even at the end of this show, it felt that the characters themselves were rushed and were easily predictable, making them quite cheesy (though that
                  seems to not be something the director focused on). All in all, it IS a movie; this does not, however, mean that it is better than anime series just because it can compact many ideas.
Although the main concept of alternating lives is an intriguing one I haven't come across before, it does not make up for the rest of the story, which lacks in depth. It is good to watch as a simple, well-constructed movie, but it does not have all the characteristics required for the most astonishing and creative anime.
Verdict sentence: Over-hype.",7,Dar-Krusos
32281,"
                I was recently in Japan and did a theater marathon of this film and Koe no Katachi (the latter of which I really enjoyed).
I would say that leaving Kimi no Na wa gave me the same feeling I had when I left the theater for Avatar in 2009.  ""That was ok. Really pretty but the writing is kind of bad.""  Meanwhile everyone jumps on it as the greatest achievement in filmmaking and it's forgotten a few years later.  
While I'm being pretty harsh, I actually do think Kimi no Na wa has a lot of cultural value.  Its style, tone, music
                  choice and story feels distinctly 2016.  I feel like we will look at this movie thirty years from now in the same way that we look back on Back to The Future feeling like an 80s film. So it's not to say that this movie wasn't enjoyable or has no cultural importance, it's that the writing and characters are bad.  And to me, that's the defining characteristic of what makes great film. 
Story and Characters -  I have tagged the beginning and end of the spoiler sections. 
The story in Kimi no Na Wa is not at all straightforward.  The plot is needlessly convoluted.  The main character is a girl who lives in Lake Suwa, Japan (which I recently stayed at and recommend visiting!) and wishes she lived in the city instead of the country. Her family owns a shrine, and she is stuck doing these ancient traditions.
  The main guy is a guy who lives in Tokyo.  He is painfully average and has almost zero character development.  We know only of what his social life is, and not really anything significant about him.
  One day out of the blue, the main characters switch bodies, and realize that they switch back and forth every other day. They begin to alter each other's lives.  The boy starts acting feminine and vice versa. 
 The direction is VERY fast during these scenes, as it's all treated like a music video.  However the visual storytelling is effective at relaying what's going on.  They have a lot of fun making these scenes, the boy gropes himself every morning as the girl and acts the opposite of the girl, and the girl makes an older co-worker fall in love with him.  
The movie then enters its second half, which is where the mess comes in.  It's hard to be critical of this movie without explaining spoilers, but let me throw out a warning here.
--SPOILERS BEGIN--
A comet comes down and destroys lake Suwa three years before the timeline event where the girl switches body with the guy.  For some reason she jumps ahead three years and spends two weeks swapping bodies without thinking of checking the year on a calendar, or finding his contact information so she can meet him when she gets her body back every other day.  Honestly, the first thing that I would do in this situation is find out who's life I'm invading, but whatever, it's fun I guess.  
The main guy goes on a quest after two weeks to find her and learns that all his body switching happpened three years ago, and that a meteor wiped out the town.  He has to go on a long road trip journey in order to discover the crater took everything out.  You would think that if a small town's inhabitants got slaughtered by a meteorite a mere three hour train ride away from Tokyo, that it would be a widely known national tragedy for years to come.  But the main character has to figure it out by going to the country and asking about a town that people tell him doesn't exist, because it was blown up. He doesn't figure it out until he sees the damn crater.  How does this make any sense?
Then he goes and finds some magic sake that the girls placed in a shrine cave, and he drinks the sake, which makes him learn her backstory as a child. Which isn't exactly character development, but at least we learn more about the girl character.
Then they have a phantom conversation that makes no sense and is only there for plot convenience.  Lots of crying, music videos, and epic camera spinning occurs.  This scene is a melodramatic headache for me.
Finally the main character's decide to go back and spend their last day saving the town in the girl's body. She convinces her friends to help evacuate the town because ""a meteor will kill us all, I saw it in a dream, trust me guys.""  So they trust her.
Her guy friend steals his dad's dynamite and blows up a power station to get the town to evacuate.  I wish I had that much faith in my friend's dreams. Maybe I don't actually.
The meteor falls and the town's people are saved.  Yay. 
--SPOILERS END--
I'm not really sure what the theme is, but what bothers me is that the film throws plot convenience in with supernatural occurrences with no explanation other than that it will push the story where they want it to go.  These things happen in plenty of movies, however, we are not given proper time to connect with the supernatural happenings.  It's already ridiculous that a meteor takes out a town, let alone the part where people are switching bodies every other day.  Why every other day? Why two whole weeks before the meteor happens? Why the main character? Why is his timeline three years later? Why three years specifically?  What does all of this have to do with the big picture of the movie? What is the theme of the film?  Like all of Shinkai's works, thematics, poetics and symbolism are thrown all over the place, but if the overall theme is as weak as ""Save the people in the town and fall in love."", I don't really see what the point is. 
If you boil Kimi no Na Wa down to its core, it's an incredibly simple movie.  The town is in trouble, a guy from the future tries to save it and a girl.  So why is it dowsing me in artistry and theme?  Koe no Katachi had thematics that I could write a massive analysis on.  There was a strong purpose to everything, and it was an excellent film documenting the human condition, which is the objective of most good film.  Kimi no Na Wa tries to be deep but in the end it's just masking its shallowness.  It's fun to watch, but boy is it flawed.
Story - 5
Character - Strong 6
Art/Sound - 
The art is breathtaking, as always with Shinkai's films.  The animation is fluid and the visual direction is always interesting.  Attention to detail is all throughout the film, and atmosphere is HEAVY in each scene.  Quiet scenes are very tranquil, and loud scenes are booming with color and brightness.  The only complaint I have is the damn 3D spinning shots around the crater.  That was just way too over the top dramatic, to the point where it was corny.
The music is well scored, and a big draw for the Japanese audience is the many songs by the band RADWIMPS.  This movie may as well have been a visual album for RADWIMPS, because they released so many hits.  I was in Japan for a month and was hearing all five or so songs they did for this movie EVERYWHERE. Rural cafes, and big cities.  Everywhere was playing the music. It's a memorable soundtrack, and they place the songs like music videos during the film.  There is an opening that plays, and a credits track, but there are actual music video like breaks during the drama of the film.  It's interesting to say the least, but certainly a strength of the movie. 
Art - Strong 9  
Sound - Strong 9
Overall - I rate the film with a strong 6 or a light 7. In many ways it's above average, but in the writing department I would say it is full of holes and below average.  There's nothing worse to me than a super dramatic story where I don't connect with the characters and don't feel the emotions they're trying to throw at me.  I'm glad other people are enjoying it, but it is very flawed in many areas.",6,ovoon7

                what went wrong? everything is what i'd like to say.
i never wanted to write a 'review' here, congrats ''your name'' for being that disappointing.
it seems like all the effort went into making the movie as visually appealing as possible. other than that? you get nothing. tbh, the 'gorgeous' animation effect was only good in the first quarter or so. 
a summary would be; a bunch of hopeless clips put together in hopes of moving the audience with some arguably nice backgrounds and decent music which, unfortunately, failed in every aspect.
there was nothing memorable from this except my frustration and the need to just get to
                  the ending. the story could've been explained properly instead of forcing so many disastrous plot holes. their meeting, connection and love made no sense at all. honestly, they themselves made no sense, were they even real? they were created in such a way that they looked like cardboard cut outs to me. their nonexistence dialogue was boring and their interaction? lacking depth and emotions.

                ---- No Spoilers ----
When I was in middle school and high school, I was the boy that sat in the back corner of the classroom and observed everyone. I liked and hated everyone almost equally. Sure, I had a few crushes, but I didn't talk much and just dismissed them as a fantasy. A waste of my time. So when I watched 5 Centimeters per Second, it pissed me off. I hated the characters. I hated the story. I hated the lack of fluidity. When I read that the director, for what I then thought was a  piece of trash, was named Makato Shinkai,
                  I made it a point to never watch anything by him. 
Then I saw Garden of Words.
As much as I hated 5 Centimeters per Second, I still acknowledged the insane attention to detail in the animation. Garden of Words was no exception, but the story completely caught me off guard. I wondered if such a work was by the same director. It was only later that I understood, and appreciated, the intention to the emotional ambiguity that is so prevalent in his early works. For those of you who watched Garden of Words, you will know that there is an emotional stance that is made. I think that was the scene where Makato Shinkai truly found his rhythm. 
Kimi no na Wa (Your Name) is a story that shouldn’t be relatable. Yet, it resounds deeply in all of us. It shouldn't make sense, yet the scene placements couldn't have been clearer. The characters should be despised, yet I find myself fascinated by them. When I  finished watching, I just sat there dumbfounded. Needless to say, it was beautiful. Not a lot of movies or anime do that to me. In fact, the feelings I had were very similar to what I felt when I watched Spirited Away for the first time 10 years ago. 
Makato Shinkai was very deliberate in what scene he placed where in the story. Every dialogue, every frame, every detail has a meaning. There was not a single second that can be deleted from this movie without losing the meaning. EVERYTHING is calculated flawlessly. This reminds me of the scene in Bakuman when Shujin and Saiko decide to switch gears and do mainstream manga instead of cult manga. Mattorai said something very interesting, mangakas can make manga in two ways: at random - coming straight from the pen to paper in order to keep everything fresh and unpredictable, or calculated to such a high degree that every plot line seems to be unpredictable when it really isn't. As you can imagine, being calculated is unprecedentedly difficult, leaving a majority of the famous mangakas to write randomly without too much thought. If such is truly the case, then there is no way that Kimi no na Wa could be written without thinking it through and through - which leads to question how much of a genius Makato Shinkai truly is. 
It's been roughly 500 words and I haven't analyzed a single element of the movie yet, and in truth, I don't think I will. This movie is rare… unimaginably rare. Nothing like it will ever exist. I don't see any justice in reviewing something like that so early. There shouldn't be a debate on whether you should watch this movie or not. History will undoubtedly look at this as a classic. 
It's pretty apparent that I gave this review, if you can call it that, to much of a biased praise. I can write an analysis on the symbolism, the plot structure, the character duality, and so on and so forth, but I don't see the point in it. Giving such a winded explanation isn't proper at this time. 20 years from now, when people criticize future anime, they will most definitely quote scenes from this movie. An analysis to this movie will come, and without a second thought by some. But, I think that, for now, watching and appreciating is the best we can do.",10,Goldsofa

                Taking ‘put yourself in someone else’s shoes’ to a whole new level, the latest film from director Makoto Shinkai (5cm per Second, Garden of Words) is a heartfelt exploration of empathy, love and loss. Kimi no Na wa (otherwise known as “Your Name”) revolves around two characters, Mitsuha and Taki, who are caught up in a strange phenomenon that allows them to see into each other’s lives. Mitsuha lives out in the countryside while Taki is a Tokyo resident, which means the pair have a window into places they’ve never seen or experienced before. The strange moments they both go through naturally lead to conflicts
                  but eventually their situation evolves into something much more profound. It’s funny, sad, horrifying, uplifting and mesmerising all in equal doses. Kimi no Na wa will reward you the more blind you go into the film. It’s a fairly simple story, filled with common themes, but elevated into something very memorable.
Shinkai has progressed beyond simply exploring concepts of love to actually writing interesting characters to express those ideas. By creating lead characters who have personalities that are actually integral to the story (Mitsuha especially so) Shinkai has managed to make something truly engaging, something that rewards you as a viewer. As a director he’s searched for ways to explore the boundaries around love but with Kimi no Na wa he’s infused enough life into the cast to make every emotional punch really hit home. There’s enough meaningful time dedicated to building thriving landscapes around both Mitsuha and Taki that Shinkai’s film doesn’t just look pretty, it is filled with wonder. Because of this he has delivered characters who manage to be equally captivating as the jaw dropping scenery they’re within – something I’m not accustomed to seeing from his films. 
The story of Kimi no Na wa certainly has its predictable moments but I’m happy to overlook them because the narrative is executed so well. There’s enough new complications added to the tale as it progresses to keep it interesting and there’s sufficient foreshadowing to make reveals incredibly satisfying. Shinkai manages to make full use of both Taki and Mitsuha’s social circles to develop their characters and make their plight something worth our time. That’s something many anime TV series struggle to do, even with plenty more runtime up their sleeve to work with. 
One of the most insufferable things watching any high school anime drama is how painfully overwrought things can get when it comes to characters expressing their feelings. While Kimi no Na wa comes close at times to overstepping the mark thankfully it manages to maintain a level of sensibility. The comedy and drama is balanced refreshingly well. There’s enough light hearted moments injected in patches throughout the movie to prevent it from becoming an over-emotional burden to sit through. It would be wrong to go so far as to call the handling of the drama ‘realistic’, but it’s wonderful to sit through something that doesn’t require the characters to inundate us constantly with how they’re feeling. Shinkai’s art, character actions and expressions all do that for us.
Speaking of that art, you know it’s going to be good. You don’t need me to tell you that. There’s endless details to be found in the background art and the animation is fluid. The score is gorgeous and it feels like no expense was spared in the sound design. Now that Shinkai has crafted some memorable characters to be a part of all this lush and vivid scenery these art and sound assets don’t feel wasted. For once I feel like I’m watching one of his films where the characters and art have been treated with equal importance, instead of being unbalanced in favour of the latter.
I was initially hesitant to the idea of people calling Makoto Shinkai the next Miyazaki but if he manages to continually craft wondrous adventures like Kimi no Na wa then I can get behind the notion. However, this will be hard to top. Some would, understandably, find Kimi no Na wa a little emotionally cumbersome and easy to predict where it may be going story-wise, but the film just clicked for me. Shinkai’s spin on young love is oozing with artistic flair and packed with stirring set pieces. It is an immensely satisfying watch from start to finish.",9,Tozzy

                Once in a while, there's a movie that can catch you attention right off the bat. This one wasn't one of them. I was, regrettably, playing Fire Emblem Fates (the shipping game be too strong). But what really caught my attention within maybe 10 minutes was the eerie atmosphere. Bear in mind that I had actually forgotten the synopsis and I was being nagged to watch this movie. Maybe I'm imagining things but even with the first few scenes, my impression was that this story can't be a slice of life story. There's an ethereal force that would move it and I was not wrong.
                  
**SPOILER ALERT - SOME ELEMENTS OF THE PLOT ARE DISCUSSED**
Story - 8
The story opened with an incredible vibe for slice of life, but something is off. We can tell from the character interactions that something is out of place. In fact, this supernatural force drives our two main characters, Taki and Mitsuha through the story. I should note that what I really enjoyed was that the force wasn't some explicit magic. It was definitely supernatural, but never fully explained nor was it required to be explained. Instead, a metaphor was used to give feeling and connection to this force.
The narrative quickly establishes the norms in each of their lives through each others' perspectives (no further spoilers) and from that point on, they begin to change. With a large emphasis on character interaction, the plot suffers slightly with a few changes in pacing later on. Nearly all scenes transition smoothly from one to another; only a few stand out and do not fit with the overall tone. 
The weaker aspect of the narrative was an imbalanced shift in character roles. One main character would take over the narrative more than the other. Maybe this is just my nitpicking (or fanboying) but I preferred a more balanced character narrative.
In all honesty, I was disappointed by (what I consider) the climax. It threw me off course relative to the events that led up to the climax in the first place. From that point on, the plot got a bit muddled for me. The single reason: there was one loophole that the plot never addressed again. I probably was too fixated on it to fully pay attention. The saving grace was the ending, which instantly gave me PADS. 
If you don't know what PADS is, urbandictionary it.
Art - 9
For the entirety of the movie, I have to say the art remained consistent. The style suited the mood and definitely complemented the atmosphere. It wasn't overly vibrant but used more dull tones to suit the down-to-earth atmosphere of the movie. There were no shounen-esque characters that screamed out ""I am the hero;"" all characters fit into a realm of reality. 
Sound - 9
The. Sound. Was. AWESOME. Not only was it awesome, it was scored by RADWIMPS, which is a japanese rock band. The soundtrack stands out on its own because of the musical tone; its not outright melodious but juxtaposes melancholy in its melodies. Some tracks are happy, some are not; most have a balance of emotions laced in between.
Character - 8
So this is another part where I get to nitpick at some things in the movie. Some side characters have absolutely no impact in the plot despite them being (slightly) more prominent later on. Now for my real nitpicking. Taki, bless him, goes through quite a bit. He learns a lot and is mentally strained at some points. Earlier on, I said that the characters go through change. But that's the extent of it; there is no actual lasting development that I can see in their character. And so in the end, both Taki and Mitsuha revert to their normal character from the beginning of the movie. Or maybe there wasn't enough to show an actual change.
Enjoyment - 10
Now the nitpicking is over. My criticism only comes from sitting down and actually thinking about the movie as a work of art. While I watched, I was completely enthralled (after I put down my3DS). The story, art, and sound are so strong when put together. It made such a lasting impression that I almost want to compare it to my favourite Ghibli movie, Spirited Away.
Overall - 9
I would give this movie a 9.3 overall if I could put decimals. My enjoyment on the 10 scale is at, like, 12. I highly recommend that anyone should watch this but especially if you are into more atmospheric movies. There aren't many other movies like Kimi no Na wa that will build an atmosphere and then drive it through (that I know of) the way it was executed. I even recommend listening to the entire OST before watching. Then watch the movie, and listen again. Overall, Kimi no Na wa is definitely one of my favourite anime movies out there and I highly recommend to watch it.",9,macklez

                **SPOILERS AHEAD**
Story: 6
Easily the weakest part of an amazing movie. Suspension of disbelief is mandatory:
>Some characters could actually be removed and the story wouldn't change very much (Like, say, Tsutomu, Okudera, and Mitsuha's father). Taki and Mitsuha as characters were never developed enough to require so many characters anyway.
>The concept of body swapping is never explained, and the rice wine scene not only complicates things, but also feels even more contrived. And we haven't gotten to the scene where they meet up. So much time wasted trying to figure that out. 
>How did they not check the date differences while in each other's bodies? It
                  was very clear they still remembered who they really were, even if they didn't remember spending time in each other's bodies. The part where the messages delete themselves is even more ridiculous, and why does Taki keep a cord that a stranger throws out for him?
>There's one part where Taki doesn't write his name in Mitsuha's hand, letting her forget him and nearly walk away from him at the ending.  Honestly felt like a forced attempt at making the audience question if Shinkai was going to pull another 5 Centimeters. Wouldn't have worked perfectly either way (Still would've enjoyed it though).
Art: 9.5
Not much to say, other than praise. Absolutely amazing art. The comet and the lake were honestly some of the most surreal and incredible things I've seen in anime. The only gripe I have is the character designs. 
It's difficult to describe how I feel, but to put it briefly, the characters do not feel endemic to the movie. If one were to take the characters and place them in a forgettable slice of life romcom, they wouldn't really be that out of place.
Sound: 8
Music in this movie is not that memorable. However, some parts where the music played was absolutely spot on. The use of rock music doesn't take away from the movie at all. The voice acting was also spot on. Mitsuha's voice is strangely pleasant to listen to, and I hope she does more anime roles in the future.
Characters: 7
Many characters that were in the film itself were almost completely unnecessary. Taki and Mitsuha's lives are glossed over, and the film had characters that led almost nowhere. Mitsuha is shown having problems with her father, but they never get resolved. Okudera and Tsutomu could've been removed from the movie and barely anything would've changed.
Enjoyment: 10
And yet, despite all it's flaws, I greatly enjoyed it. I would still recommend this to people who are bored and looking for something to keep them for a while. Still, I can't help but feel as though this movie should've been an anime series. If they had put more emphasis on Taki and Mitsuha's backgrounds and took the time to explain the body swapping, this could've been a masterpiece.",8,Project_Pems

                This is my first review, so bear with me as I try to flesh out how I feel about this movie in simple terms.
To start off, I went into this movie with very high expectations. Perhaps it is because I heard so many great reviews about it. Everyone I knew, even friends who generally don't watch anime, ranted and raved about how this was one of the best films they'd ever seen. This exact same thing happened to me when I listened to everyone's reviews of Frozen-- I finished the movie feeling disappointed. Your Name did not fail to leave a bitter taste in my
                  mouth by the end. I think it has taught me to take opinions with a grain of salt. It's always better to go in with low expectations and leave satisfied than the other way around.
STORY: The story was, to put it frankly, boring. It wasn't anything special, and I honestly expected it to be amazing with the way everyone was going on about it. Substance is one of the most important parts of a story, and Your Name truly lacked in that department. Maybe it's just the cynic in me that is completely tired of all these rehashed love stories, but I cannot be convinced that the plot was anything new or exciting.
ART: I've seen Shinkai's work throughout the years, and the scenery was always the most well done. At least the movie had this much going for it. The animation of the people has improved vastly from some of his earlier works, too. I was pleasantly surprised by this. The art isn't the most impressive I've ever seen, although I do congratulate Shinkai on setting a trend for using a stupid amount of light sources and gradients. You cannot deny that many animations have tried to look like Your Name since its success. 
SOUND: The sound was lovely. I can't argue with RADWIMPS being an obviously good choice for any sort of slice of life setting. Their music fit well with the theme of the movie.
CHARACTER: Haha. This got me even more than the story, in the sense that the poor character writing was a major part of why the story was so bad. I don't have much to say about this other than he was a boy, she was a girl. Can I make it any more obvious?
Enjoyment: I had a really hard time enjoying this film because of the lack of good story line and decent character development. I didn't find it fun, or exciting, or even sad (as hard as they tried to force me to be). I only wished for it to be over soon so I could go do something more productive with my time.
In conclusion, I don't know y'all lol. I'm old and tired of seeing the same 5 heterosexual love stories portrayed in the media as ""compelling"" and ""inspiring."" They're not. They're boring. No amount of gradient laden art could save me from feeling so disconnected from the characters, and the story in general. I can't say I hated it, because I know there are many people who would fight me on that, but I didn't like it either? I suppose I just don't care. It was overrated, and not my cup of tea. If someone were to ask me if I recommended it, I would answer simply with, ""it's worth watching if you go in with no expectations.""",5,copia

                Seeing this movie so high,  at the top ratings,  made me incredibly curious about it, and I watched it with the highest expectations possible. 
So, overall, I can tell that I enjoyed it, and that it was as fun as it was emotional... HOWEVER, Kimi no Na wa, has its flaws:
Let's start by briefly explaining what the plot is:
SPOILERS AHEAD
A boy and a girl,  suddenly ( and I doubt it's ever explained why ),  start switching bodies, each time they go to sleep. They also wake up with amnesia-like symptoms, not remembering what each other's names are. So, they start using
                  diaries to contact each others when they switch, and living with this mysterious phenomenon. 
However, once they stop switching for a good while, the boy finds out that the girl died in a natural disaster ( in this case, a comet crashed onto her village, killing pretty much everyone  ), three years prior to this supernatural phenomenon. The boy then, finds a way to switch bodies with her once again, and tries to change the past by warning everyone about the incoming catastrophe. Unfortunately, he fails, and the girl dies once again. 
The ending is quite odd. Both the protagonists find each others in their adulthood, and there the movie ends. 
So, I honestly can enjoy seeing the interesting experience of two individuals switching bodies, especially when they are both of different gender and live in completely different settings... However, I was not happy about how they simply went along with it, didn't question it, or simply have not figured out that they lived in different timelines. In this regard, I feel like the movie skips very important parts of storytelling, and stretches itself out in useless scenes that do not advance the story at all. The beginning itself is very confusing, and slow.
The animation and effects are beautiful, but when it's about a movie and not an anime series with several episodes, there has to be more than godly animation to impress me. The sound was pretty good, but doesn't quite fit as I wish it would have. 
The main characters, just as the plot, concern themselves too much on romance, and almost never on drama, despite the situation and the circumstances would require them to. And also by the fact that these two haven't even actually spoke to one another. Their personalities are also very difficult to pinpoint. You may say that the side characters are actually written, or interpreted better. 
The ending made no sense, and it's unexplained as well, plus it is also a cliffhanger. 
Honestly, I can say that I enjoyed this movie a lot, but the ratings are absolutely overrating it. This is NOWHERE near the best between every anime series and movies! WAKE UP, PEOPLE!
Anyway, despite its flaws, it was a really fun and kinda unique movie to watch.
A good 7/10. I would give it an 8 if at least a few things would have been handled in a better way.",7,JThePervSummoner

                Kimi no Nawa is up there with the quality of work Studio Ghibli makes. It’s a journey in a world breathing with atmosphere, mystery, and visual wonder. A journey about growth and resilience in the face of overwhelming odds. A journey about human emotion that transcends space and time, as we watch our two protagonists struggle relentlessly against fate. A journey that might just be one of the most captivating anime movie experiences I've had in years. 
Director Makoto Shinkai’s artistry is something people tend to love or hate, but this film is solid proof to all of his disdainful critics that his movies were
                  never  “just eye candy”. They explore the nature of life and relationships in quiet ways rarely seen or discussed, which is why most of them are not fast-paced or action packed...and why they are so beautiful. But even if you’re not a fan of this kind of style with its major use of metaphorical imagery and mixture of subtle and explosive emotions, definitely give Kimi no Nawa a chance. This is by far his most ambitious, original movie in many ways. For instance, there’s an actual mystical element to the story apart from his previous films that are set purely on realism. The pacing is a lot faster and intense. There’s a surprising amount of humor in the script, making the chemistry between the characters more light-hearted and comically entertaining than expected. All of this is done through a narrative vision so emotional, so brilliantly realized, that I’m pretty sure everyone at the Anime Expo world premiere screening was tearing up, including me. 
Without spoiling, what mainly drives this film's story is the dynamics of our main characters’ relationship. The way these two interact is just so unique and lovable. The premise itself allows them to bond on a more personal level, far more intriguing than the usual teenage love story where boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy gets girl. Eventually, you become so invested in their strange relationship, that when all the action goes down, it's no longer just suspenseful - it's almost heartbreaking. 
 Editing and sound design play a HUGE role in this immersion. There’s rarely a single dull moment because of how gripping and emotionally driven the timing of every cut is. The sound design combined with a beautiful music score is outstanding - subtle and moving when creating atmosphere, powerful at times of dramatic conflict. In fact, the same can be said for pretty much all of the visual aesthetics - which if I haven't already mentioned, are amazing. This is a prime example of astonishingly jaw-dropping animation combined with powerful storytelling.
Kimi no Nawa is not just any anime movie. It has the potential to be viewed and studied as art cinema. It’s so beautifully crafted and meticulously detailed,  I feel like I didn’t even cover 80% of its greatness in this review. To do that, I would have to make a spoiler analysis review, and to do that, I would probably have to see the movie again, maybe a couple more times before I can fully appreciate this nearly flawless masterpiece. 
I know I sound like I’m fanboying, but I’m being fully honest here - if Director Makoto Shinkai keeps this kind of quality up, he is going to be an even bigger name in the anime industry for years to come. Remember Your Name long enough until it's available in your country, if you're not seeing it in Japan theaters. Because trust me, you're not going to forget it. 10/10",10,CCshinobi

                Now before you say anything the show itself was stunning, the animation, the drawing it was beautiful. But when we are talking about the story it's just bad. The story is very confusing and it's missing something it just feels incomplete. While the story is very original but it could be much better if it had more explanation or a longer movie. The ending really felt incomplete and empty, most of the story is just useless to the ending. I think the way the story was made is way too complicated and and too complex if the studio stuck to something simpler the movie could

                How do I describe the greatest piece of media to ever grace my lowly existence? Well, let’s start with what’s immediately obvious about Kimi no Na wa, because just the surface layer of this masterpiece is enough to impress even the most cynical of critics. 
Without getting into spoilers, I’ll sum up the plot as convoluted and poorly paced. The sloppiness in storytelling really touched me and added an immeasurable amount of weight to the gorgeous animation. That’s right, the rumors were correct. This movie is beautiful. The sheer amount of lens flares present during the runtime shone brightly on my soul and illuminated what
                  life really is about. If I had a body pillow for every time the rays of the sun were enhanced to unsightly levels in the post-production of this movie, I’d have my own cotton harem.
Besides the presentation being obviously exceptional, the writing takes spotlight at the same time and plays like a symphony to accompany the art on screen. Both protagonists are incredibly complex and distinctive, as is typical of Makoto Shinkai’s films. In fact, I was so dazzled by the natural characterization that I can’t even remember the personalities or features of either the girl or the boy! How incredible is it that the title of the film, ‘Your Name’, would tie in so seamlessly with how I can’t remember their names? It’s like I’m constantly finding new masterful brushstrokes in this Mona Lisa of an anime.
In the end, this movie’s message poignantly shaped how I think. Previous to my first viewing (of dozens), I would have thought that if I got switched into the body of a random person consistently over weeks, I should probably figure out her location relative to mine or at least try to call my number. But now that I’ve watched Kimi no Na wa, I know that in order to advance the suspense in the plot I should just partake in such classic antics as living her life for her and groping her boobies! How else would the movie sell well to the widest audience possible? All I can say is, thank you Makoto Shinkai. You’ve given meaning to my life, and I’ll forever cherish this gift of enlightenment.
Overall 10/10, but actually 7/10 because on my eleventh rewatch I realized that it was supposed to be a romance.",7,PicklePride

                *Reading this review will make you notice bad things about the movie. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't read this.
Your Name is like that one SpongeBob episode where he's wearing inflatable muscles that look impressive, but when he tries to actually lift weights his arms pop off his shoulders. Your Name looks great visually, but as far as plot goes, its arms pop off.
It's also a good-hearted Film with wonderful art. 
If you're looking to zone out to something on a rainy Sunday afternoon and can easily emotionally connect with movies, Your Name may be a good pick. It has some really great
                  background art to take in, a few funny scenes, and has sincerity to it.
However, I did score this a 4/10. Being fairly boring aside, its main problem is that it does not make sense. Its leaps of logic took me out of the movie, including: confusing scene order, a peabrained ""romance"" storyline, and contradictory/unexplained plot devices. Makoto Shinkai is clearly skilled in art and cinematography, but here, the storytelling is not very much that. I feel like the movie rides on its charm and visuals, hoping that's enough for you to not notice its poor writing. To be fair, the strategy worked for most of its audience.
The characters are likable (I liked Mitsuha the most), but you don't get to know them well. Not enough for them to be of much impact. My favorite stories are character-driven, and this isn't. But Miyazaki characters are the same way, yet those movies are pretty good. I did feel a tinge of emotion for these characters, but I hardly knew them and their story wasn't told well, so it wasn't much.
I can see why people like Your Name, it has its moments and is visually outstanding. Most people like the movie, maybe you do as well. Maybe I'll like it more someday when I'm less critical, since I did like parts of it. 
Still, the more I think about the movie, the more I believe that its plot was only  about 70% properly finished. What it tried to deliver needed another 45 minutes of character and plot development, because much of it makes no sense and feels cut off from itself, like an incomplete sentence. Maybe Shinkai knows this more than anyone and ran out of time by a large measure.
A good-spirited movie with fantastic visuals, enjoyable humor, and a disjointed narrative. 
Might I add this: when you encounter someone who dislikes something popular that you enjoyed yourself, you can see them as someone to resent and oppose, or you can see them as someone who wasn't allowed to enjoy something everyone else did. A boat you may be in sooner or later.

So I finally got around to watching Your Name and it was a pleasantly surprising movie. It didn't intrigue me much from the trailer. While the idea seemed at least sort of interesting, these kinds of teen romances haven't ever been an object of enthusiasm from me. They often feel overly naive and  cloying. I can't control my own cynicism, can I? 
Your Name surprised me in two ways. One, it provided a fairly hefty twist midway through which thankfully wasn't spoiled in the trailer. Two, its focus on romance was less abrasive than I expected. I was pleased with how little the focus
                  got in the way with the story that was actually interesting to me, which both serves as a criticism and a compliment. The objective of Shinkai was to create a romance, but the romance he was creating wasn't that interesting. Ethereal connections rarely peak my interest. 
That being said, the story around the romance was much tighter. A refreshing dose of like-able secondary characters, at least from one side, provided an added bonus. Inject some beautiful animation and serviceable voice acting and you get a product that feels both easily like-able but also oddly detached from any emotional core. Regardless, it was a good, yet somewhat unremarkable movie. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
[Chemistry Class]
The story of Mitsuha, a seventeen year old girl born in the countryside; who's sick of the countryside, wishes to be an attractive boy living in Tokyo. Enter Taki, an attractive seventeen year old boy living in Tokyo. Her wish gets granted, inexplicably, and she switches bodies with this boy for a day. Obvious hi-jinx ensues and they keep switching bodies until one day they don't. 
This entire concept takes place within around forty minutes and while it is nice, compact, and tidy. It never actually resonated with me. There were a few visual gags here and there, mostly played towards the girls expense, but they really didn't craft a solid, cosmic relationship between the two. Don't get me wrong, it is very difficult to create chemistry between two characters that never met. However, that is what Shinkai set out to do and unfortunately, he didn't succeed. This tight summary and introduction to these characters was decently interesting but, as I said, it lacked any emotional attachment. I never felt as though they were bonding with one another through stepping into each others shoes. 
Perhaps this served to bring the story into its more dramatic second act, however, the total lack of dramatic storytelling felt at ends with the romance that the viewer needs to believe in. What i'm trying to say is that they learned nothing about one another. I suppose that's the point. To create a cosmic connection. However, I don't believe it. Maybe i'm just a victim of my own bias and interest in different kinds of stories, but the whole ""fate brought us together"" is such a unbearable cliche to me. This is my cynicism talking, but you can't just form a connection through vague metaphors about time. 
The story itself, though, was very well structured. While the connection between characters was never intriguingly romantic, the connection they had to their environments and the narrative that weaved through them was most definitely interesting. Especially come the second act where your notions about the story are completely derailed in the best way possible. Suddenly I cared, not about the two protagonists, but about the concept of the story. 
While Mitsuha's side of the narrative was better, as she had more developed secondary characters that played a significantly more important role in the story.  Taki's side felt extremely barren in comparison. The secondaries never felt lively or engaging and hardly had any fun interactions with one another. This even permeates to Taki himself. A character is only as good as the characters he or she bounce off of, if that is what the writing requires. So the lack of decently realized secondaries really drags his character down as well. 
Since Mitsuha's side was more prominent, the story never felt meandering. When Taki eventually dominated the scene by himself, it was more compelling since he wasn't in need of bouncing off the lifeless corpses that were the side characters in his story. I'll speak about the concept of scenery later.

[Sound and Visuals]
What can I say. This film is beautifully animated. Was there ever a doubt? The designs are slick, the landscapes are gorgeous, and everything is perfect and easy on the eyes. Apart from one moment towards the second half of the second arc where you are taken through some pretty surreal and awesome imagery, the movie never really flexes the animated muscles. It's a beautiful film to look at, but it never makes a statement about that. 
If I had to point out a minor complaint it's that there was a lot of noticeable CGI utilized in various scenes. Particularly the vehicles moving around the highway. Especially in shots that are closer, it becomes a bit too clear that they are totally computer generated. In other words, the compositing could've used some work. However, other moments where blatant CG was composited within the image were smooth and easy on the eyes.
What a lot of viewers don't realize is just how much CG is being used in animation now a-days. Even this kind of cell-shaded animation utilizes fully rendered CG landscapes with some well-placed cell-shading to make it look like what you'd expect from two dimensions. This allows the director, in this case Shinkai, to do more complicated shots without the need of painstakingly redrawing certain frames and images. For example, there is a panorama early on in the movie and it was completely rendered, thankfully, very well made and virtually unnoticeable. 
Great compositing mixed with slightly below-average compositing occasionally detracts from a few of these more atmospheric scenes. However, it never makes a big enough impact to ruin any of them. In fact, you don't even see many cars on the highway. It's fine. The directing, as well, is serviceable. A few dazzling and creative segments intertwined with less-inspired imagery dominated the film. Some moments I can't help but admire the shot composition, other moments are kind of boring. I wish directors played around with dialogue a bit more in general, since a lot of the dialogue here rarely actually looks interesting apart from maybe the scenery in the background elevating it. 
The sound is good. Again, some great sound effects mixed in with music that I personally don't really care for. I think there was one moment later on in the film that felt completely dissonant in terms of the song being played and the events happening. The people are in a panic but there is this up-beat pop-song in the background. It was jarring and completely unnecessary. Your Name also included a series-like opening introduction which felt unnatural and baffling. Even the montage, while the smallest offender here, still didn't work that well. 
Sonically, it wasn't bad, it just had a hard time fitting in. The sound effects themselves, such as the rain pouring down and Shinkai's fetish for opening (and closing) doors all sound great. The music itself could use some work. It felt as though the producers got a few people to write this music and they just had to shoehorn it into the film somehow. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
[Place Over People]
Towards the third act of the movie, I began realizing something kind of strange happening. I started to realize that I care more about the land than I do the people inhabiting it. I personally can't tell if this was intentional or not, but the countryside that Mitsuha inhabits is so detailed and gorgeous and has such a alluring whimsical appeal that I couldn't help but fall in love with it. The focus on this little town was abundant, but it never felt as if it was the purpose. It was written in as a story point, rather than a character in and of itself. Yet I had a better connection with this town than I did any of the characters. 
Once again, I'm not sure if it was intentional or not but in art I always love giving the benefit of the doubt. Even as our two protagonists forget each others names and that's the emotional string being snapped, Taki, an aspiring architect, remembers the town Mitsuha inhabits. The fact that he forgets her name, yet remembers this world she lives in creates this wonderful connection that was never elaborated on. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Would that connection lose its value if Shinkai elaborated on it? 
What's even stranger is that Mitsuha wants to desperately leave this place. She thinks it is boring, lame, and totally not what she wants. She waxes on about how much she rather live in a bustling city like Tokyo, with cafes and people surrounding her being. Yet Tokyo, while pretty, never has even remotely the kind of life and vibrancy that this town has. Yet this is never addressed. She never talks about this again. If this is subtle storytelling it comes from a completely unexpected place since, for the most part, everything is explained pretty well within the world. Of course they don't touch the ""time"" and technical aspects of the body-swapping. But I never expected them to. With stories like these, stories which aim to tell an ethereal experience with a celestial connection, there is no need to bog it down with a technical side of the whole ordeal. 
Regardless, this fascinating location helped elevate the stakes of the story for reasons I dare not spoil. I will say, however, this connection I drew added so much more than the romance these two characters are explained to have. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
[Conclusion]
Your Name is a good movie. I can definitely recommend it to just about anyone, anime fan or otherwise. I can even see why it is so highly rated. It is an infinitely accessible story with just enough nuance to become a narrative people feel is original and making a statement without ever becoming something esoteric or avant garde. 
There are a few issues here and there that often detract from certain scenes that I won't harp on. For example, the amount of out-loud monologuing that happens is just unacceptable. It feels as though it is there simply to explain, bluntly, to the viewer what these characters are thinking. Visual storytelling is never really utilized, which is unfortunate since the movie itself is so beautifully drawn. There are also a few logical lapses that cause character motivations and decisions to be extremely questionable and occasionally stupid. However, it is almost wholly a positive, albeit somewhat unremarkable experience. 
Your Name brings gorgeous animation, decently realized characters, just enough charm, and a surprisingly interesting premise. What it lacks is heart. Apart from the little town that I drew a connection to, I felt almost completely detached from everything in this movie. It never felt like a passion project. Which unfortunately caused me not to become invested in a lot of the scenes being created. Thankfully, Your Name's restraint on overly-cloying and obnoxiously dramatic romance deserves praise. Anime, often rightfully so, is criticized for presenting emotions way too bluntly. Romance is often overly-saccharine, anger is often overly-angsty, and so on. While Your Name isn't devoid of sappy sentimentality, it doesn't indulge in it.
Which speaks for the movie as whole. It has this extraordinarily talented group of animators with all the budget and time in the world working on it, yet it never feels the need to show off. The story is surprisingly understated, albeit for an absurdly huge blockbuster that it is, and was meant to be. The romantic themes may not be fully realized, but the film itself feels like a whole. I appreciate that.",7,Artrill

                Kimi no Na wa, or Your Name, is a film directed by Shinkai Makoto who is often called the “next Miyazaki”. The movie itself is about destiny and fate, focusing on Mitsuha, a girl living in a small town, and Taki, a boy living in Tokyo. The two begin swapping bodies and the movie continues with, bringing in themes of time travel and love along with a large amount of tacky plot conveniences. Despite its obvious and many shortcomings, I believe that Kimi no Na wa is an anime everyone should consider watching at least once. 
Story (4/10)
Kimi no Na wa is 1 hour
                  46 minutes long and I feel it was, in the first half, unnecessarily prolonged. The introduction of Kimi no Na wa, though it introduces vital components that become important later on, drags on for an extended period of time making this anime feel like a slice of life akin to the likes of K-On. This movie continues with its snail-like pacing until after the climax end and then suddenly the film feels very rushed as the pace rapidly picks up and leads to a less than satisfying conclusion (though it is a conclusion nonetheless). The beginning of the show is very disconnected from the actual plot of the show and, despite a few moments of foreshadowing, really avoids giving any hints as to what will happen later on in the movie when everything really goes downhill. 
In the second half of Kimi no Na wa, the movie feels a lot different in both theme and pacing when compared to the first half as the actual meat of the story is fed to the audience at a much more rapid pace. Even though certain points in the second half are just as slow as they were in the first half, the second half begins throwing large amounts of information at the audience that is all relevant to the plot. I began to feel that the first half of the film was meant to do nothing except introduce the simple characters that populated the world along with a few key things that you will miss as they feel irrelevant to the actual plot. The one thing I will commend Kimi no Na wa for doing is making it so the information is easily understood despite being thrown at the audience in large portions, allowing everyone to continue to understand most of what is occurring.
In the second half of Kimi no Na wa, the movie also begins to throw new, plot convenient devices at the audience, such as time travel, and forces them to swallow these plot devices, making the story feel more and more forced. I don’t want to say to much on this topic as I’d like too refrain from spoiling as much of the show as possible, but I really do feel there were a lot of unnecessary and complicated themes thrown into the film for plot convenience that do nothing but hinder its value. 
The final thing I’d like to cover in this section of my review is how well the movie evokes numerous emotions from you. Though some might argue that these heart wrenching scenes are forced and pointless, I do feel they serve a purpose as they are successful at pulling the intended emotions from within you. I’ve heard that, while directing this film, Makoto had a board on which he would write what he wanted the audience to be feeling at certain points and I feel he nailed it. The presentation of these countless emotional scenes along with the stunning visuals and soundtrack evoke the intended emotions out of a majority of the audience and are able to continue doing so no matter how many times you watch the movie. 
Art/Animation (10/10)
I feel that visually, Kimi no Na wa is one of the best anime I’ve seen to date. Its wonderful animations paired with its vivid colors and it's beautifully detailed backgrounds make it very aesthetically pleasing to the viewer and there’s really nothing negative I feel I can say about this aspect of the movie. 
Sounds (9/10) 
Though it’s not the best soundtrack I’ve ever heard, Kimi no Na wa’s music was still above that of the average animated movie. Almost any song can become extremely effective when placed at the right moment in the right anime and I feel this is something that Kimi no Na wa accomplished almost perfectly. Each song was perfectly inserted at the right moment and is heavily involved in the emotions you feel during the movie. Most of the major songs are also enjoyable to listen to outside of the movie and, in some cases, without any prior knowledge on it.
Characters (3/10)
The two main characters, Taki and Mitsuha act as most of us most likely would if we switched bodies. At first they believed it was a dream and once they realized it was reality they freaked out and began demanding the other not do certain things. Though these characters are written at a lower level than they should be considering the production value, they are still passable (even if barely) and I believe that, though their motives are weak, being a mostly distant feeling of love, they are still somewhat acceptable to the current teen population that this movie was trying to reach. 
However, aside from the passable main characters, the audience is also introduced to a vast array of side characters who are poorly written. Despite their friendship with the characters, they never seem to worry or recognize the vast difference in personality the two have and never question obvious actions that the character, had they been themselves, never would have done. These side characters are never really explored and almost nothing is learned about them except the fact they’re friends with the main protagonists. The motives for their actions are left to our imagination and they do some of these actions on a whim despite the substantial consequences that come with said actions. 
These side characters did, however, have plenty of opportunity to be developed. This includes Mitsuha’s father, the mayor, who has a poor relationship with his daughter and Katsuhiko Teshigawara (or Tessie) who makes a comment about how hard his life is in the movie. As I said before, Kimi no Na wa seems to want to focus on what seems like irrelevant information and never really develops the side characters, barred the audience from properly connecting with them. I will say, however, that the audience can connect to the main characters and said characters are able to elicit empathy from the audience.
Enjoyment (10/10)
Kimi no Na wa is something that I had the pleasure to see in theaters 3 times and it’s something I didn’t regret. Despite being boring and slow at points, the show manages to draw you in with its amazing music and visuals, making each moment memorable. It’s an anime that I have taken several different people to see in theaters and something I plan to show many more on my TV. This anime was very enjoyable despite obviously lacking in many departments and was something I was able to sit through multiple times despite not being able to sit through other movies that are, in a critical sense, better than this one. This movie keeps me coming back and it continues to make me feel what it wants me to feel like a puppet and that’s something I feel is much more important than any critical review of a show. 
Overall (7/10) 
Though critically I know and agree it’s not the best anime, Kimi no Na wa kept me coming back and kept me entertained. I understand why people might give it a 10/10 but unfortunately I just can’t while looking at this show critically without bias.",7,Aidan

                Overall - 10/10 
Kimi no Na wa is an aesthetically stunning and musically breathtaking masterpiece by director Makoto Shinkai which builds upon his previous works to deliver a film which is both fulfilling and thoroughly enjoyable. Watch it if you have not done so already.
What Kimi no Na wa presents to the audience is the maturation of director Makoto Shinkai's work. Those familiar with Shinkai's previous works (for example Byousoku 5 Centimeter and Kotonoha no Niwa) should be accustomed to his tendencies of creating bittersweet and unresolved endings; love him or loathe him, Shinkai's latest work demonstrates a slight deviation from this usual style. While
                  the finale of the film remains relatively open-ended, there are many more reasons to be optimistic for what comes after than compared to his previous works. 
MOVIE SPOILERS BELOW
Story - 8/10
The premise of Taki and Mitsuha alternate days switching bodies is simple enough - that is until Makoto Shinkai throws in time travelling and alternate timelines. While the movie actually maintains a reasonably easy to follow timeline, however, digging deeper into the nitty-gritty reveals a couple of major plot holes which cannot be ignored while covering the film. The biggest plot hole being that once you consider that both Taki and Mitsuha were keeping diaries for their counterpart, even with suspension of belief, it becomes quite difficult to believe that the pair would not notice dates aligning, especially considering the 3 year gap. Beyond this major issue in the writing, the film is able to strike a balance between lighthearted and dramatic scenes, maximizing the impact upon the audience. What the movie succeeds incredibly well at is building up tension and engaging the audience. Themes of distance, time, inevitability return from Shinkai's previous works but are applied in a much more positive light which is a welcome change. On the whole, the plot of Kimi no Na wa is cohesive if a little cliched but represents a more optimistic outlook of the future from director Makoto Shinkai. 
Art - 10/10
Makoto Shinkai's art style has always been unique and in Kimi no Na wa, he has continued to refine and hone his technique from his previous works. The end result being a film that is absolutely incredible from a visual standpoint. Going as far as to say that this film represents the pinnacle of animation would not be too much of an overstatement. It is perhaps as photo realistic as an anime can get; many of the locations in the movie were directly replicated from real life with the utmost attention to detail. A meteorite has never looked so beautiful and deadly at the same time, the sense of scale of the meteorite's destruction stands out amongst the peaceful surroundings of the countryside and it is equally as awe-inspiring as it is bone-chilling. The contrast between the country-side and city as emphasized by the two montages that play during both Yumetourou and Zenzenzense definitely stands out with both sceneries being beautiful in its own way. When talking about Makoto Shinkai's art, the colour palate employed can never be overlooked. While depicting Tokyo, the skycrapers of glass and steel are punctuated in-between by more brighter colours, resulting in an electrifying and bustling atmosphere. The lush colours used for the countryside reflects it's more easy-going nature. During kataware doki, the orange glow unites the main protagonists in a heartwarming fashion before slowly fading to dark - reestablishing a sense of isolation and enforcing the loneliness of separation. All in all, absolutely top notch animation of the utmost quality.
Music - 10/10
If this site would allow users to rate sections with scores exceeding 10/10, there would be nothing more deserving than the soundtrack Kimi no Na wa. After watching the movie, what remains with the audience above the story and visuals is the audio aspect and only by experiencing the full effect of the music in the cinema does this film justice. A masterpiece of a soundtrack crafted by Radwimps, while many point to Zenzenzense and Sparkle as the standout tracks (of which both of them are deserving of), the hidden gem Yumetourou goes unnoticed. Being the first track of the film, Yumetourou does an exemplary job at establishing the tone for the rest of the film, beginning from its quiet verses sung over the muted strumming of a guitar which builds into a cacophony of sound for the climax is what initially hooks the audience into the film. Futari no Ihen (Unusual Changes of Two) flows almost seamlessly into Zenzenzense, another highlight of the soundtrack with its unrelenting drum beat coupled with a catchy guitar riff makes the song into a hit. The climax of the film where Mitsuha runs to inform her father about the impending disaster is set to Sparkle, which opens with a simplistic piano figure sets a quaint backdrop against the looming danger of the meteorite. Progressively, more instruments join in, starting with percussion and eventually a full string section resulting in a piece that is befitting of the climax of such a stunning film. Even more impressively, what stands out from these fantastic tracks is the usage of silence in the film, most notably once Sparkle concludes; right before the meteorite crashes into the town, there is a brief moment of absolute silence, followed by the blast and rumble from the collision, the silence builds tension to a palpable level and is as important as the rest of the soundtrack. The character tracks are very befitting of their namesakes and accurately reflect the personalities and behaviors of the characters they are named after. The overall cohesiveness of the tracks alongside the handful of standout ones are reminiscent of concepts albums which is very fitting considering the soundtrack's role in the movie.  
Character - 7/10
Where the movie perhaps falls a little short lies in it's character development. Whether be it due to constraints in time or simply poor writing, there seems to be a distinct lack of any significant character development over the course of the film, that is not to say that development is always necessary. What Kimi no Na wa offers is a bunch of vibrant personalities who remain true to their initial image to the end. Beyond that however, there seems to be little reason for the audience to empathize with this cast of characters. While Taki serves as an acceptable main protagonist with Mitsuha being his counterpart, the film makes it difficult to truly relate to them and oftentimes, their actions seem to be counterproductive, and it is this friction between the pair that makes it so difficult for the audience to grow attached to them. At points, it is almost as if Shinkai had shoe-horned in the romance aspect just to appease a certain group of fans as at no point in the movie, did it truly feel that the Taki and Mitsuha were really growing closer as individuals. Of course Taki's decision to write ""suki da"" on Mitsuha's hand is bemusing and out of place given his actions so far but it is equally if not more frustrating to find out that Mitsuha was going to do a similar thing. Many conflicts in the film could have been resolved easily if the characters were just able to rationally consider their options at any given point. With suspension of belief, it is possible to imagine that perhaps those around them had forgotten about the events around the time Taki and Mitsuha switched bodies, but it is goes beyond suspension of belief to imagine that all traces and impacts of the body switch has disappeared. The lack of character progression and slightly questionable decision making on behalf of the main cast results in an average score for this section.
Enjoyment - 10/10
Even with it's fair share of plot holes and head-scratching moments, I definitely thoroughly enjoyed watching Kimi no Na wa. Given the chance to watch it in the cinema again, I would pounce on that opportunity without hesitation. Watching this film in the cinema is the best way to fully appreciate how absolutely gorgeous the visuals and soundtrack are. I implore those who have the means to view it in the cinema to do so. 
Final Words: Kimi no Na wa is nothing short of an absolute masterpiece, with it's captivating visuals and emphatic soundtrack. While the film has it's fair share of flaws, even those can be overlooked to an extent given the overall strength of the film. As it stands, Kimi no Na wa is an anime that will no doubt stand the test of time and it will be quite some time before any other anime film will touch it's records. An anime unparalleled in global impact.",10,tehnoobcakez

                This review may contain mild spoilers as argumental points.
Kimi No Na Wa is easily one of the most overrated anime movies of our time. In fact , I don't have a doubt in my mind that Kimi No Na Wa has its #1 ranking on MAL simply due to the sheer number of people from a western theater release. 
I jokingly call it the Naruto of anime movies because of its overwhelming popularity and high praise from people who don't watch much anime in general. In fact , if Kimi No Na Wa at the time had been replaced with say , ""Sakasama no Patema""
                  , it would have had the same effect Kimi No Na Wa had.
Well that's enough rambling , without further ado.
---Art :
Easily the strongest point in the series , done to a very high standard. I'd love to get more into it but it really doesn't need any more explaining.
2/2
---Sound:
There was one track that I really liked during the series but that's about it. The voice acting was just 'okay' , most likely due to the blandness of most characters as I will mention in a moment . Most of the sound from the series quite honestly , felt uninspired. 
1/2
---Story:
How people can give the Story a 10 is beyond me.
The amount of crap that is not explained (everything) , use of Deus Ex Machina and laughable ""romance"" in air quotes is appalling. 
I'm well aware of the time constraints a movie has but that's no excuse for an underdeveloped story. NOTHING is explained. Sorry , but random supernatural occurrences that occur because magic is not good enough. That goes for soul switching and time traveling. It would have been SO easy to explain any of these things in a brief moment (instead we get , yay , filler characters). For example , lets say the meteor is of a material not found on earth and has a property that makes it exist in two timelines at once (which could be shown by having a meteor rock change and move between the two timelines in a split screen where one character does something to one half and it changes the one in the other timeline). I just pulled that out of my ass in 5 seconds and it still would have been better than nothing.
Cliches and Deus Ex Machina , techniques that impress only the most casual of viewers , were of course present. For example in the diner RIGHT before our protagonist gave up , where the owner just happened to be from there , happened to pay attention to the drawing done by an amateur artist mind you and also happened to be so impressed that he would take him there in his care (in a one way ride to the middle of nowhere , he didn't even question that maybe the kid wanted to go there to kill himself since it was so isolated). Disgusting.
To call this a romance is laughable at best. A romance between two characters that never even met, and only communicated through pre-written notes. Granted the supernatural nature of the anime , 'of course' they fell in love. But when you think about it logically , for people to fall in love in that situation it would require a special type of desperate , which wasn't shown for either character.
Story 0/2 , if my system allowed it I would be rating this lower.
---Characters:
Kimi No Na Wa obviously focuses on the two main protagonists and does manage to develop them somewhat. Unfortunately , for all other characters development and emotion is pretty much non-existent. This really wouldn't be a problem in some cases but Kimi No Na Wa has a notable amount of screen time for filler characters.
For example , the manager lady was completely bland and would have no notable features if it wasn't for her sex appeal to her coworkers , the schoolkid who planned a terrorist attack without a second thought ( actually has some personality , but no explanation for his knowledge and actions ). And last but not least the demented old man , whom anyone with half a brain would question to take a worried young man on a one way trip to a wasteland.
The two protagonists being somewhat relatable is what saves this.
Characters 1/2
---Enjoyment:
Honestly a very mediocre movie. Comparing it to say Sakasama no Patema it feels like a strictly inferior movie and Sakasama was not rated super highly by me regardless.
It feels just like when The Dark Knight came out , where people were making accounts just to rate The Dark Knight a 10 and The Godfather a 1.
If we were to receive more anime movies in theaters I'm sure this wouldn't happen often.
Regardless of all my criticisms , its not terrible.

Weak plot, weak characters, beautiful art, and amazing musical score. Plot and ""romance"" between our characters were far too contrived for me. I mean, so it starts out with our protagonists switching bodies
                  AND time traveling (as we later find out) which is cool and all, but the movie doesn't even try to explain it; or how it started or what made it stopped... The plot just sort of moves along and tells you ""well, just cuz bro"".
Time travel and body switching are both cool concepts that deserve to be a bit more than simple plot devices. So many unanswered questions that the writing didn't even attempt to explain. Why did both characters have the ability to travel through time and switch bodies? Why did they both have relapsing amnesia throughout the film? Was it so we could have that silly ending? What the hell was the purpose of that cafe chick? She was just kind of there and the scenes just added in for a longer runtime.
Why do these characters fall in love with each other when they barely speak throughout the movie? Speaking of which, I never really cared for either, both were very flat paper dolls, especially Taki. Then we have the whole ""save the town"" thing; so why does this guy get to travel back in time, inhibit this girls body and save the town; was it initially Mitsuha that initiated the switch when she randomly yelled about wanting to be a Tokyo boy? And it seemed pretty lazy that the entire climax happened OFF screen (as the female protagonist perfectly remembers everything that is about to happen but not the dude's name) and one second later everyone is saved, killing any suspense that could have been built upon. There are so many disconnects in the story with no clear direction or logical progression; the music was amazing, but not enough to cover the weak, underlying writing for me personally.
I love anime as a medium and it can be a beautiful way to tell a story, but I feel it gets abused sometimes where style is often the focus over substance. I just could not find myself connecting with the story or the characters, which unfortunately made the beautiful soundtrack often feel out of place.",6,incarnate1

                Let me start off by saying this is a movie that is heavily ""supernatural"" driven. While other shows may contain supernatural elements, they fail to lay out the foundation of those very elements until it is convenient; in other words, they usually wait to explain until the very end. However, with Your Name, it was laid out from the very beginning. By doing so, it marks a consistency and gives itself time to explore its world while not leaving you in the dark about the paranormal that is at play. This was one of the movie's essential strong points. 
From the starting point, a comet
                  was able to be seen by people from many places - two in particular. While the heavily populated city life brings up this sense of individuality and independence, the more community-based counterpart has a motif of connectivity and unity. Understandably, the contrasts of living in an exciting city or serene countryside - reinforced by the undeniably attractive visuals - is enticing to any eye. One could argue that anime, a form of art, is intended to make you feel, or make you think, or simply to be enjoyed. Although, one should also ask themselves what the perspective really is when viewing someone's story. Every good story should have a purpose, and every purpose should be supported by its story. Makoto Shinkai's works are similar in the sense that they are on an emotional spectrum with a sensitive side rather than a philosophical one more grounded to reality. You could debate about whether an anime is ""realistic"" or not, but then you would lose sight of the point. Kimi no Na wa ends up fabricating an interesting spin on the theory of time travel by implementing a supernatural twist of body switching along with it. However, by creating a reason that triggers these two elements, it manages to combine them both. 
The body switching aspect playfully reveals the lives of our two main characters, the adventurous Mitsuha Miyamizu and the diligent Taki Tachibana. Mitsuha lives a more traditional and spiritual life while Taki lives a more modern and covetous lifestyle. While being in each other's bodies, they learn the little details about each other and grow to understand or respect one another's viewpoint. They, quite noticeably, influence and grow as individuals despite the unconventional role of communication or interaction. The prevalent theme of being connected is both shown from a direct and indirect position; from a straightforward supernatural approach to a much more broader concept of the ""universe"" in an intangible, spiritual sense. This theme is particularly supported by the comet itself that is present from start to finish. While the themes were certainly consistent, Kimi no Na wa's message is made evident by the ""divide"" in time and polarity of differences. 
Overall, Your Name has an unyielding story right down to the title. Although it may not be on the realistic side, it is certainly an interesting and engaging experience that manages to deliver its overarching message of looking at the bigger picture.",8,Zelev

                If you are well-acquainted with anime history, film, television, art, or any sort of creative thought, then I would advise you not watch this movie. At the most, I only recommend watching this after watching Ghost in The Shell, Redline, or any Miyazaki movie just so you can realize that this movie is a plague to the anime community.
The best thing that can be said about Kimi no Na wa (which if you don't immediately already think is a stupid name, I promise you will by the end of this movie) is that the animation is obviously very good. I don't think that's a great
                  reason to watch an anime, or else we would actually just watch Pacific Rim and Transformers instead of Neon Genesis Evangelion. 
The story is fine, essentially a mixture of Freaky Friday and the Notebook. I think the anime community should pay more attention to things outside of anime, and maybe movies like this wouldn't be so successful. But truthfully the story is occasionally touching and interesting. The characters are likeable, but by no means are they interesting.
The TRUE TRAGEDY of this movie is that it epitomizes what the masses criticize about anime: it's a bunch of cutesy fantastical romance to attract 13 year old girls, and if you don't wanna watch some starry-eyed J-pop montage then anime isn't for you. NO!!! If you are reading this I pray that you are here for reasons other than having your first period, and you see something special in anime that can't be found elsewhere. I don't want anime-haters (i.e. most of the entire world) to think THIS is what anime is. Yet here we are, allowing this movie to outrank 30+ years worth of incredible cinema. C'mon guys. This movie's ranking is outright disrespectful.
If despite my advice you just desperately need something that caters to the desires of anime-loving teenage girls, watch this movie. Go ahead.",5,Sakkeru

                Probably my first review. I might have written one before, but I'm not a pro at this but I'll do my best to convince you to watch this movie because you share good things that make you feel warm inside to other people so they may feel warm inside.
I was able to watch the World Premiere of this movie at Anime Expo July 3, 2016. I have to say it was truly an amazing movie.
There might be some spoilers-but not intentional-in this so read at your own risk.
I'm rating this a 9 because I tend to suspend my disbelief to the fullest due to my
                  personal bias for Shinkai films. There are unanswered questions and whatnot, but I don't care about that. Just know that it isn't perfect and that there are kinks but for the somewhat realistic review of this movie, I will not be giving it a perfect score across the board as much as I'd love to.
Story:
This movie is probably at the top of my list, if not very close to the top, of my favorite movies. The story was nothing like I personally had ever seen but still had Shinkai's generic boy-meet-girl plot. A city boy and country girl are connected through time because of this comet that comes every 1000 years or so and they end up trying to meet. They one day wake up in each others bodies, without knowing anything about the other and end up exploring and falling in love(?). 
Art: 
If any regular tv anime was able to produce at this quality, I'd be watching everything just for the art. Shinkai sets a whole new standard in animation and cinematography. I'm a fan of scenery and with Shinkai's creations, it's impossible for me to rate it anything under 10.
As with any Shinkai movie, he adds another depth to his art. His well-crafted CG animations are so high-quality and well thought out so that everything just looks as breathtaking as possible. It's almost as if he has broken through the dimension of animation and entered reality-just an exaggeration but you get the point. Even if you have your eyes fixated on the focal point of each screen you can't help but notice the details he puts in the background. I was able to purchase Shinkai's art book regarding '5cm per second' at AX also, and it truly was one purchase i won't regret. Each scene is just so wonderfully crafted to capture the emotions and keep it flowing through the scenes to come.
Sound: 
Shinkai employs one of his favorite bands-RADWIMPS-to create a soundtrack for him. They had the script I believe about a year and a half ( not really sure) beforehand to be able to create the compliment to his masterpiece. The soundtrack was wonderful. I had no complaints about anything other than the fact that I have to wait for it to come out. RADWIMPS definitely delivered a high-quality score that is able to capture the feelings of the moments and put it out. The score also was able to flow with the direction of the plot and characters that it felt so natural for a song to come out.
The voice acting in this was also amazing. The actors did a wonderful job, especially the voice of Mitsuha, Mone Kamishiraishi. Her voice was beautiful and I definitely felt the emotions behind her voice in particular scenes which I grew more attached to after finding out that she's still new to voice acting. The male lead's voice actor Ryunosuke Kamiki is more experience and therefore was also able to fulfill the role fully. Their voices were wonderful and fit the characters to which they were assigned.
Character: ( I suck at this so you can skip this part. then again I'm a noob when it comes to writing reviews.)
Given that this is a movie, their developments early on aren't too complex. It becomes established they are simple teenagers in their respective niches in the population, but somehow as the story progresses we are given more and more complexity to their character but not the depth you'd see in a television series. The story definitely played a big role in developing them. The side characters just are there, the typical discovery-help protagonist-gone type of deal. Not too much on the side characters, a few moments here and there which helps the side characters feel like a natural part of the characterization of the two leads.
Enjoyment:
I have to say I was not bored a single moment of this movie. Maybe it's because I'm such a fan for Makoto Shinkai films or that I was able to attend the world premiere at my first Anime Expo, but this movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I was interested in the movie and there were some cringe worthy moments but not without a few gags here and there. It was a well-crafted movie to keep you entertained but isn't enough you make you watch this over and over and over again. It's one of those gems you watch again every blue moon. You watch it when it's nearly faded in your memory so that you may experience a wonderful movie once more. It's also a romance genre film, and I'm a fan for romance so this also allowed me to stay interested.
Overall:
If you like HD pictures, scenery, romance, science and anime, this movie is worth watching. Some may not agree with the ratings and that's totally fine- to each his own. 
But as for my 2cents, this is a well crafted movie filled with stunning graphics and scenes driven by a romance plot centered around two teenagers from different worlds connected by some cosmic event filled with a wonderful soundtrack. 
I would recommend this to you if you like any of the aforementioned categories above.  I've already been bugging my friends to go watch this as soon as it becomes available.",9,rikimaaru

                I went into watching this movie expecting a masterpiece but I was left kind of underwhelmed at the end. My review will focus more on the flaws of this movie because this movie has been praised many different ways and nothing can be said that hasn't been said before.
Don't get me wrong this movie was really enjoyable. Animation, visuals and soundtrack are amazing and top notch.
Story was good as well.
But there are some issues with the execution of the story. In the beginning there is a problem with story-telling like some events critical to the plot occurring off-screen then being told about in third person
                  the next day. Its always better to show, not tell. Because of this for the first 30-40 minutes, at times, there were some pacing issues where the plot seemed to drag. The plot seemed unfocused at times where important plot points are put aside in favor of side stories. This kind of story-telling would have been fine if it were a 12-episode anime but for a 106 min movie every second counts especially when you are dealing with 2 stories that could have been 2 separate movies.
The main characters' relationship was somewhat under-developed. First there is  some body swapping with accompanying comedy and then there is some hint of mutual appreciation and care. Then a montage happens and then we are literally told ""they like each other, so root for them"". For a movie that relies heavily on romance to drive its plot there needed to be some significant development of romance early on. So it could act as an effective catalyst for the last half of film.
There were also some major tonal shifts at times from standard rom-com to straight up tragedy but this was somewhat necessary to keep the movie enjoyable without being too heavy handed.
Before watching it I was kind of pissed about this movie not being nominated for an Oscar. But after watching it I get why it didn't get nominated. 
Overall this movie is really good and enjoyable but don't expect it to be a masterpiece.",8,LazyPanther

                TL;DR: If you’re watching for the plot, wait for one of your friends to pick this up on blu-ray. If you’re here for the overall experience, it’s totally worth your twelve bucks to see this at the theater. In fact, it’s worth it to go twice.
STORY (5/10) 
One of my favorite authors is Ray Bradbury. If you’ve read any of his stories, especially “Night Meeting,” it’s difficult not to compare Kimi no Na wa. to his work. The mix of heartfelt slice-of-life and compelling, almost breathtaking science-fiction is what initially made me love his writing so much, and it is exactly this that is the
                  strong point of Kimi no Na wa. We are introduced to our main characters as they find themselves inhabiting each other’s bodies, and, instead of delving into the (probably boring and obnoxious) science behind this, the story simply plays out in a very enjoyable and easily digestible way, showing how they cope with each other’s everyday life. About halfway through, a very well-foreshadowed plot twist hits, which was what really sold me initially on this movie. In truly Bradbury-esque fashion, we watch as the bonds built up between these characters are slowly broken down by a cosmic force beyond their control.
If you’re determined enough to find plot holes in something, you will find them. Obviously, Kimi no Na wa. is no exception. This is especially true because of the inherently convoluted nature of its premise - it explores understandably confusing topics like dreams, soul-swapping, time travel, unconditional love, and hallucinations. The fact that all of these intriguing ideas are blended together does make the plot at times difficult to understand, but luckily, thanks to Shinkai’s great directing, the viewer can always tell what emotion they are supposed to be feeling and what details are important at any given time. However, if you choose to dig a bit deeper into the concepts presented, you can find some plot holes (I can't describe them without delving into spoiler territory). Of course, because of how little is known scientifically about all of the topics explored in this movie, it's also equally easy to find justifiable explanations and cover-ups for these plot holes.
What really bothered me about the story, though, was not the presence of plot holes, nor its confusing nature. After the plot twist halfway through, the movie starts to pile on more and more plot twists, which range from clever to goofy. Shinkai is known for making his viewers cry during his movies, but it felt as though this movie was trying a bit too hard to affect its audience near the end by piling on new ideas that neither meshed with the overall message and themes of the film nor made logical sense with the rest of the plot. There's a time about a half hour before the end where it feels like the movie is going to be over soon, but it keeps going on for a while, trying out all of these new ideas that almost feel like alternate endings. It's as though this movie has planned out ten possible endings but can't decide which to use, so it tries its best to use all of them at once, using time travel as a cheap excuse for the inherent convolution which follows. Naturally, it feels sloppy, and the scenes which focus on romance actually subtract from the movie’s effectiveness by straying from its focus on fate and supernatural forces in favor of throwing in desperate attempts at making the audience cry, which feel wholly unnecessary. Emotional appeal does not necessarily equate to a good story. Just look at Scum’s Wish - it felt uncomfortable to watch, but that didn't make it good, did it?
ANIMATION (10/10)
Breathtakingly beautiful. Some of the opening shots are of a comet streaking through the sky, and it only gets better from there. At one point, it even turns multimedia, with colored pencils and a different drawing style… There's really not much to say here other than GO WATCH THIS F***ING MOVIE.
SOUND (8/10) 
There were three tracks that really stood out to me here. The opening theme, the ending theme, and the song that plays during a montage about halfway through were all great. Besides being a bit generic (teen romance movies always need rock music, right?), they are certainly good. When I went to see this with my friends, we were rocking out to the soundtrack during both car rides. I’ll probably be listening to that montage song for the next couple years.
Of course, because there is rock music used in this anime, it is impossible not to make jokes about Naruto.
CHARACTERS (4/10) 
This was by far the weakest part of the film. I find it ironic that I couldn't even remember their names after the film was over. Both the male lead and the female lead were the most generic possible teenager characters, with neither characterized by anything other than where they worked. Their reactions to being in each other’s bodies were quite well handled, with an emphasis on initial surprise and confusion, and this helped to demonstrate their personalities. However, because we were given minimal background on these characters and therefore no reason to believe that they would act any other way, it is worth noting that these were the most generic reactions possible.
Even worse are the side characters. If the motivations of the main characters were foggy, these characters have no motivations at all. We are told about their relationships with one another, but these relationships never end up being explored. Some are simply forgotten about. The best example of this is near the beginning, when characters complain about how the mayor’s daughter gets along with the son of someone the mayor is working with, and it is hinted that nobody likes the mayor. Following that scene, the topic is never revisited. This seems like a genuinely interesting side plot that could really lead us to understand our characters better, but it is absolutely dropped for no reason.
Perhaps it would have been interesting to see how the side characters reacted to our heroes switching bodies. In a few cases, we do see how the body switches have impacted their lives. But we never see the side characters legitimately concerned about the sudden changes in personality that they see the main characters undergo. They mention the characters acting strange, and leave it at that. Never do they actually grow suspicious, even when it is hinted that other characters have experienced the same phenomenon. This becomes especially problematic after the main plot twist, when one side character just accepts a seemingly impossible story told by his friend because the plot requires him to provide the exact materials needed by the main character.
Near the end we have one of our leads going in for a job interview in a hilariously blatant show of forced character development. The main idea of character development is that it is supposed to help the hero grow out of a flaw that they somehow developed for themselves long ago. This scene does not connect to any problems the main character had had earlier. 
Another thing that you will notice is that the only possible ending that the writers decided not to visit in the final half hour would have offered an opportunity for much more coherent character progression. However, it was left untouched.
ENJOYMENT (7/10) 
I said it before, and I’ll say it again: If you're seeing this at a theater, you're going for the visuals, not the plot. And, as a Bradbury fan, I even found the plot to be pretty enjoyable. I knew most of the storyline going in, so I could see that there was a fair amount of rewatch value included in the movie as well. I’m a stickler for Chekhov’s Guns and plot holes, though, so I was a bit more bothered than most by the film’s storytelling problems.
Also, I found it difficult to be emotionally affected by the movie because I felt no attachment to the characters. As explained previously, if the ending had handled itself differently or if we had seen some more background to these characters, especially the male lead, I would have cared about them much more. 
Nonetheless, this was still a treat to see in the theater.
OVERALL (7/10) 
The car ride home from the theater was spent with my three friends (all who gave the movie a 10/10) trying to convince me to raise my rating. I don't see that happening, but I completely understand why they enjoyed it as much as they did.
It's not hard to see why this is ranked number one on this website. It may not be the best anime, but I'm certainly comfortable with Kimi no Na wa. remaining as the face of MAL for quite some time.",7,Stacys__Mom

                this really has 9.32 MAL Score wtf? i feel like doing a review just to express and let out the disappointment. THIS HAS MAJOR SPOILERS .
 this made no sense at all the more i was thinking the less sense the movie made, the visuals are great sure, and there were fun moments but the plot just made no fucking sense, basically the meteor was predicted to fall, so that family could dream and exchange bodies with others just so that one day they could use that to save the town people, those 2 kids did it in 3 year time difference, time traveling their
                  minds just to stop it, and maybe this was all possible thanks to a God? who then makes them forget it just so they can obsess over it and as adults find each other but still no memories?
And how do anyone justifies the plot holes like:
  At no point did either of them see the date and realize they were living 3 years in the past and future
  They never tried to text or call each other to discuss what was happening and were happy with just leaving notes in each others diary. 
  How do you expect me to believe the boy never even took the time to find out what town he was living while using the girl's body?  the school he spends most of his time in is literally called ""Itomori High School"" and he still couldn't make this connection.
I think that was all the movie had in it, i still don't get it why is it so popular, why do people like it? guess i will never know, same with Frozen, Twilight etc... somethings just have no explanation and so this movie to me it was average at best sorry.",6,MadLane
32281,"
                ""Your name"", nostalgic isn't it? 
Two powerful words used in the conversation between two people who have just meet, thinking that bond will last forever, yet as years go by and ""your hair eventually turns gray"" we tend to forget who we are and who we were.
Who you loved, who cared about you, who helped you, who...was always there for you when you were younger. We cant go against this law of nature, this flow of time, this forever lasting curse that is called memory. For we humans are the peak of evolution who have a built in instinct to survive,adapt and overcome any obstacle
                  that is in our way including human emotion and memory.
Yet this movie gives you the impression that there is still hope, that there is still that one shinning star in a gloomy sky who illuminates the way in front of us.
I do not write reviews, so bare with me my brothers and sisters for this movie is such a masterpiece that you cannot just write this review with minimal effort.
Note that i will try NOT SPOIL this movie for you in any way, if you think that i have in any way overstepped my boundaries feel free to inform me and i shall remove/edit it asap.
Now without further ado let me begin.
Story: 10/10
The plot is simple and unusual, and yes i have already watched 5 Centimeters Per Second, i mean who hasn't?
So  maybe i am giving it a 10/10 for the plot simply because i can somewhat relate to the movie +  i am a sucker for romance, overall its just my opinion.
Art: 10/10
Nothing to say here, if you watched the trailer for this movie you already know that these people put in a lot of effort into making it thus it would be unfair to give it anything less than a 10, heck i would rate it even 11 if i could.
The animation is breathtaking and flawless, simply said : Omigoto *claps*
Sound: 9/10
Well if you watched the movie you should have noticed that some scenes are just ""Wow the feels"", what i mean by that is some soundtracks are perfectly selected for some scenes,for example scene 1 and soundtrack 1 are in perfect harmony which equals to perfection, while some are like scene 2 +  soundtrack 5 equals to just ""meh"", there is no harmony in that, if you catch my drift? 
If you don't understand what i mean ( cant blame you tho, i am a complicated individual) then just watch the whole thing and you will hopefully notice these little details.
But overall i gave it a 9/10 because they almost did it flawlessly, note that this little thing is not going to affect my overall opinion.
But like they say ""You watch it, you rate it. ""
Characters: 6/10
I am always rough on the whole character thing to be honest, but to keep it plain and simple.
I am a sucker for romance, the emotions are there, the voice actors did their part yet why am i giving it only a 6 out of 10?
Cliche friends, cliche. 
You can notice all these traits almost in every genre/tag in the Romance section.
The two MC are nothing new in this department, clumsy, likable and did i mention clumsy. If you find this sentence to be a spoiler then my man/girl you probably forgot to do your homework. I know its harsh, i know i am a baka but please do not hate on me for this one people.. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
Nothing to say except Shinkai Makoto, you the man.
If you watched 5 Centimeters Per Second you know what i am talking about.
This man know his stuff, he knows how to punch and always saves his best punches to finish you off.
Just watch it and you will know what i am talking about.
Overall: 10/10
Really enjoyed this work of art, haven't boarded the feels train in like a week, you know the rest.
Moral of this story is quite simple and quite the hard hitter.
I won't give you the details but know this.
Enjoy your life, never forget the bonds you already have, try to keep and cherish them for as long as possible.
Value your opinion and of course respect yourself and your family.
Keep moving forward without looking back because you never know what the future hold in store for you, maybe just maybe you get one more chance from life to try something with someone you love and cherish.
Keep it real you beautiful people and i hope you have a nice day.

                Before i start talking about what i liked and disliked about this movie, i just want to point out that this movie is the highest rated anime movie on this website. I did not know this before watching this movie, and if somebody asked me if it deserves that title i would say no.
Now that't not to say there isn't good in this movie, Kimi no Na wa (your name) has some incredible art, some very good music, and it honestly kept me wondering how it would end and wrap up what happened.
That being said ... some of these character moments often prioritise melodrama which
                  in turn makes them look completely idiotic because of the situation they are in. (i will explain later)
Story: 5/10 (Mediocre) (Spoilers)
This is probably my lowest part of the movie, it loses all logic for drama multiple times, a love story that is much too fast and forced. It honestly hit me like a wrecking ball how they instantly fall in love ... they haven't met at this point, they have their own lives, their own goal and she even sets him up on a date but instantly flips to interest and romantic attraction.
But even if you ignore the forced love story ... how does the ending make sense? Taki acted like a complete moron for dramatic tension and instead of writing a message to himself or even the girls name who he ""loves"" at this point, he decided it was a higher priority to repeatedly shout her name for dramatic effect when he  knows he is going to forget who she is in literal seconds... what do you know, moments later he remembers ""oh yeah ... i will forget the girl i love time to write her name! wait ... who is she again?"" 
I honestly rolled my eyes. This moment along with her ""forced comedy"" reactions to meeting him the first time. Joking about how he touched her boobs when they swapped bodies and how hes ""just a pervert!"" really destroyed this anime for me. In my opinion it wasn't ""cute and awkward flirtatious jokes"" it was silly anime trope nonsense. 
(Spoilers) Now ... i have multiple other things that don't make sense, like how she somehow convinced her dad to listen to her when he is the mayor and knows there isn't a forest fire. But he somehow listened to her advice and evacuated everyone to the school after rejecting her advice for the whole movie and outright stopped their attempt to earlier evacuate everyone.
Or maybe how they are three years apart but when he dated her school papers nobody questioned the wrong dates? There would be discrepancies between dates, maybe it was Wednesday for her but years later it would be Friday for him.
But the biggest issue is the ending, they lose their memories and pass each other on public transport. But have a ""feeling"" they know each other. They then tease walking away again only to stop and declare to each other ""i think i know you!"" yes the ending to this movie is ""love conquers all"" even complete loss of memory due to time travel.  
(spoilers over)
Art: 9/10 Great
Really really great art, there is even a scene where the style swaps to something more painterly and it looks incredible. Vivid, colourful and eye-catching!
Sound: 8/10 Very good. Apart from a little lacklustre voice acting, the soundtrack was great and has multiple ""anime style opening songs"" which honestly were also very good.
Character: 6/10 Fair. 
This one was tough, i debated between mediocre and fair for a while, but i settled on fair. I think the word ""fair"" sums the character development and motivations perfectly. It does just enough, and yes they often act absent minded for the purpose of drama and yes it forced a rushed love interest in a girl and guy they have never actually met. But for most of the movie they are fine, that being said some of the side characters are quite likeable, like the girl who works in the restaurant with Taki.
Enjoyment: 4/10 Decent.
It's decent, and i can say that if you just want a cute movie with decent drama, great art and fantastic music. This could easily be an 8 maybe 9/10 for you. As long as you don't expect the creators to focus on logic and reason over drama. But for me this wasn't so enjoyable, i found myself rolling my eyes too much and jumping on characters stupidity in the moment.
Overall Kimi No Na Wa (your name) is a 5/10 for me. (Mediocre) I do understand how this movie is rated so highly, but does it deserve that high rating? Honestly, no.",5,jzombee
32281,"
                I’ll be honest when I say that I never really wanted to watch Kimi no Na wa. There was always too much hype around it and it wasn’t until about a year later that I finally decided that I should pick it up. In particular, I was feeling bitter and sore about how this anime managed to jump to 1st place on MAL in scores, besting my favorite anime, FMA:B, for several months when it was first released. I thought to myself, “How could there be ANY anime that could even compare to FMA:B?”
In fact, I was appalled by the fact that this wasn’t even
                  a TV series anime - Kimi no Na wa is just a single movie. I had my doubts. Can there really be sufficient character and plot development in a mere 1 hour and 46 minutes of screen time? Can a story which is centered around the cheesiest anime trope - a high school romance - really be any good?
I am glad to say however, that I was pleasantly surprised at how Makoto Shinkai managed to deliver so much, so succinctly, in this anime. The plot is surprisingly delightful - it wasn’t perfect, for sure, but it was interesting enough to keep you sitting through that without feeling one bit bored. The characters were really as rich as they could be for an anime movie and I would gladly welcome spin-offs to grant deeper insight into their backstories. But this anime impressed me the most with its jaw-dropping, stunning visuals and of course an amazing, beautiful musical score to go along with it. 
To put it in the voice of the main cast, Kimi no Na Wa was absolutely…

Art: 10/10
I have to start with the BEST thing about this anime, which is the entire aesthetic that Makoto Shinkai has impressively weaved into this anime. If I had to use one word to describe the type of aesthetic you see, it is “photorealism.” By this, I don’t mean that the images look real, I mean that the images you see are more real than reality, they are in a sense, hyper-real. So real that you basically feel like you are dreaming as you are watching the movie. The colors used in the anime are excessively vibrant, as if an amateur photographer adjusted the vibrance meter in Adobe Lightroom up a notch too high. Everything is way too beautiful, so much so that it feels like a fantasy, which fits exactly with the entire plot of the anime.
As a photographer myself, I want to call attention to the enormous amount of frame-by-frame detail that Shinkai has put into his animated timelapse sequences of real-life Tokyo and (not-so) real-life Itomori which is based on Hida prefecture. Those shots were simply mind-blowing, and it looked exactly like how it would have felt like shooting those timelapses in person, on site, in the real world. It takes a ton of effort to draw each timelapse frame by hand and it was very obvious that Shinkai based his animation out of an actual timelapse that was taken onsite, down to the movement of the cloud shadows across the scene and the little jittering caused by the wind when it sways leaves and other elements in the scene.
Although the lens flares throughout the anime could be seen as distracting, I thought they were placed perfectly. They completely added to the entire dream-like vibe that you get from the anime and really honed in on what the Comet Tiamat represented - a shooting star - something that makes wishes come true. The art was just mesmerizing as if a dream.
In fact, I would go so far as to say that if you removed every character from the anime and screen ONLY the background shots for an entire 1 hour 46 minutes, I would still be so encapsulated by the scenes and would still have to stay to watch all of it. There are so many scenes where you see tiny characters enveloped in a huge, beautiful landscape, whether it is the mountains, or the landscape or the cityscapes. It is as if Shinkai were telling us that the anime is really not so much about the characters but so much more about the places that we visit that brings us, and the characters, to life.
Sound: 10/10
Of course, if I talk about the visuals, I definitely can’t forget the amazing music that is playing in the background as all of this is going on. RADWIMPS really did an amazing job on the rock music scores and those songs (Dream Lantern, Nandemonaiya, Sparkle and Zenzenzense) are still stuck in my head an entire month after a first watched the anime. All of those songs are amazing and are seriously fighting for a spot on my anime playlist.
Aside from RADWIMPS though, the rest of the background music was also top-notch. I recently had a listen to the entire soundtrack of the anime again on their own, without any visuals, and I could still feel all of the scenes and emotions come back to me even though I was merely listening to the backing tracks. That is pure testament to the emotive power that the musical scores of Kimi no Na wa bring to the table and is something that you really do not want to miss out on.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Comedy
Most the entirety of the first half of the anime were full of funny parts that naturally occur as the result of the male-female body switching phenomenon. There were some obvious tropes in the anime, such as Taki constantly touching Mitsuha’s boobs and Mitsuha getting embarrassed about having to use the bathroom as a male, but there were also moments of ingenuity and creativity. Although most international fans might not catch it, there was a scene when Mitsuha (in Taki’s body) was using the wrong “I” pronouns (“watashi”, “watakushi”, “boku” before finally saying “ore”), much to discomfort of Tsukasa and Shinta. Mitsuha also had these little thought bubbles that popped up to show her inner thoughts, which I thought was really entertaining to see. I also really enjoyed Taki and Mitsuha’s little quarreling with each other through their diary entries as they complained about each other’s inappropriate behavior. (+3 for comedy)
Drama
The second half of the anime was basically full of drama and emotion, beginning with the moment of the plot twist. The music played a huge role in this and the anime really hit hard when it needed to. Taki’s sense of despair, Mitsuha’s frantic running, an impending comet that would spell doom for the both of them, and yet the little glimmer of hope that seems to always rest on the horizon like the setting sun during twilight (or Kataware-doki) - all of these were played up really well and very believably, so much that I was really taken for a ride with unexpected turns of the story. (+3 for drama)
Pacing
The pacing for this anime was incredibly smooth. There were no parts were I was overly bored and no parts where I felt was overly rushed. Everything was executed perfectly - from the little moments where the camera lingered on Taki to emphasize the depth of emotion, to the points where the anime really skips chunks of the plot that was really not necessary to show and could be easily inferred. I felt like Shinkai had a really clear sense and direction of what he wanted to show and what he wanted to omit, and I felt like he hit home all the right spots where it mattered and managed to trim all the parts that didn’t. (+3 for pacing)
I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it! (+1 for no filler episodes, duh)
Story: 9/10
Thematically, the story is excellent. It really doesn’t have much of that romance bit that it looks like it should have, but it has a lot to say about remembering the past and preserving the present. From the threads of Itomori to the architecture of modern Tokyo, we see both Taki and Mitsuha struggling to preserve what is left of their identity, especially in terms of the places they are rooted in.
The meteor that splits from the comet of course, represents any catastrophic disaster that is capable of mass destruction of such memorable places. The Japanese are not strangers to such events. Earthquakes are common, and the memories of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster are still there, albeit perhaps forgotten, as Shinkai seems to suggest through the film. You would think that people remember these catastrophic events, but Shinkai suggests, through Taki’s forgetfulness amongst other means, that people actually don’t. In this light, the film can actually be read in parallel to Isao Takahata’s “Grave of the Fireflies.”
Shinkai thus encourages us, through the show, to revitalize our continual commitment to historical preservation, because in it lies a valuable part of our identity that should not be lost - just as in the so-called “Great Fire of Mayugoro.”
My only contention with the story is the fact that there are some minor plot holes such as the fact that the plot twist might not work as well if you actually think about it a little more. (-1/2 a point)
Also, the resolution, while nice, just seemed a little too forced and something that was meant to appease the fans. Sure, it was still beautifully done and all, but I think more could have been done to leave open questions about the anime that many fans would have really enjoyed debating about. (-1/2 a point)
Character: 10/10
All of the characters are just absolutely great. Although it is certain that you can’t get much backstory from any of the side characters, they are still realistically written and creatively designed so that they interact very well with the mains.
Miki Okudera
She comes across as a playful person at first, constantly teasing Taki, winking and so on. But at some point in the middle of the anime, you can see hints of a deeper side of her, especially in the scene where she talks to Tsukasa and whips out a cigarette saying, ""I quit recently, but..."" This is never followed up on in the anime of course, because it wouldn't be vital to the story, but I loved this small addition to really bring out the deeper nature of the character. (+1 for multifaceted)
Toshiki Miyamizu
For most of the anime, Toshiki is portrayed as a bad father. He is a missing father figure in the Miyamizu family and Mitsuha treats him with much contempt. Since we see the anime from Mitsuha's point of view, it is unsurprising that we come to hate Toshiki's character as well, especially when he gets in the way of Mitsuha's plan in the later part of the anime. However, we do see a bit of a backstory in Mitsuha's flashback to the past to the time when her mother died. Toshiki, in particular, blamed himself for his wife's death, and for an undisclosed reason, began to spite the shrine god of the Miyamizu family from that point on. Even when Mitsuha goes to see her father for the last time, we actually see both Hitoha and Yotsuha there in the office with Toshiki, which indicates that perhaps Toshiki still cares for the Miyamizu. In that scene, we see behind Toshiki a rock with the Chinese character for ""heart"" on it, suggesting that even though Toshiki seems to have a hardened exterior, we are reminded that he still has a heart within. (+1 for depth, +1 for backstory)
Yotsuha Miyamizu
Mitsuha's younger sister, even though she is naive about certain things, really added a lot especially to the comic element of the story. Suffice to say, the scene where Yotsuha finally had enough of Mitsuha's weird actions and says, ""Yabai yabai yabai!"" over and over again was absolutely hilarious. (+1 for lovable)
Mitsuha and Taki
Both Mitsuha and Taki show great character growth as they go through the plot. Their interactions with each other are in fact very vital to the plot and they learn something about themselves through this relationship. (+1 for growth, +1 for vital, +1 for interactions)
*If you do want to hear about what I think about the main characters, you can read on after the end of the conclusion, but be spoiler-warned!* (+3 for ???)
Overall: 10/10
Really great movie that stands out from all the others. Honestly, after watching Kimi no Na wa, I could really understand why it managed to top the charts at MAL and displace Spirited Away as the world’s No. 1 highest grossing anime movie. I think Kimi no Na wa certainly deserves this title even if Shinkai himself, in his humility, still reveres the great Hayao Miyazaki. Definitely, a must-watch!

***SPOILERS AHEAD, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK***
Okay, so you are here, and I really hope that if you are still reading this, you have already watched the anime. If you haven’t, please stop and go watch it, and then come back because you would otherwise not understand anything that I am saying from this point on. For those who are inclined, I have also included timestamps in parentheses if you would like to refer back to the specific scenes I talk about in the anime.
The real reason why I am giving the characters a full score is because this a story with only one main character. The two main characters you see on the poster are really just the same person. 
At first glance, Kimi no Na wa appears to tell a story about the intersecting lives of two people through a combination of body-swaps and temporal shifts. However, upon closer inspection, Kimi no Na wa is about a rural girl, Mitsuha, reborn as a urban boy, Taki, who seeks to recover the sparse remnants of their distant past and save it. Initially, one would presume that the mysterious power bestowed upon the Miyamizu family by the shrine god is what allows Mitsuha and Taki to swap places in their sleep (1:05:30). However, no such body-swap is taking place and instead, it is merely Taki who is struggling to piece together his past in pursuit of his lost identity, Mitsuha. This leads to the conclusion that Mitsuha and Taki are actually the same person, with the same “soul” - that is, the invisible, immaterial container of human consciousness, mind and memory. In 2013, Mitsuha lives in Itomori, a rural town. Mitsuha, by masticating rice and spitting it out into a vial, puts half of her soul, henceforth referred to as the “preserved half,” into the Kuchikamizake, which is left in the underworld at the shrine god’s resting place. Mitsuha is then killed by a meteorite and, due to the gravitational distortion of time by the comet’s passing, the remaining half of her soul is reborn as Taki in 1999, henceforth referred to as the “reborn half.” In order to avoid a contradiction where the same “reborn half” meets itself in the same world, Taki only begins to recall fragments of his past in 2016, 3 years after Mitsuha’s death. After Taki finds the shrine crater and consumes Mitsuha’s saliva from the Kuchikamizake, the preserved half goes back in time as Mitsuha in 2013 to avert the disaster. Meanwhile, the shrine god takes away Taki’s memories of Mitsuha as a price for entering the underworld and the reborn half within Taki continues to survive in 2016. With incomplete memories of each other, Taki and Mitsuha finally meet in Tokyo in 2021 after a long search. Thus, Kimi no Na wa is a story of Taki’s journey of reconstructing his lost past.
The overarching concept of reincarnation is commonplace in Japanese society, which has been historically and culturally exposed to the tenets of Zen Buddhism. However, the idea that the same soul can exist in two different bodies simultaneously is novel. Both Taki and Mitsuha have missing mother figures – just as Mitsuha’s mother passed away (1:02:17), Taki’s mother was also absent from the story. Also, both Taki and Mitsuha have two close friends from school – just as Mitsuha hangs out with Teshi and Sayaka (10:58), so does Taki hang out with Tsukasa and Takagi (21:44). Furthermore, both Taki and Mitsuha have the image of water in their names – Miyamizu, which is Mitsuha’s family name, means “shrine water,” while Taki means “waterfall.” These close parallels between the lives of Taki and Mitsuha hint that they share the same reborn half of the soul, even though each of them seem to have a separate consciousness. Early on in the anime, Teshi provides an important clue when he mentions the possibility of Mitsuha’s consciousness existing in an Everett multiverse (10:12). Named after Hugh Everett, the Everett multiverse refers to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics which posits the existence of multiple alternative universes that branch out over time as events occur. In particular, an applicable variation of this theory is called the many-minds interpretation (MMI) which states that instead of the universe branching out into different timelines, it is the observer’s mind that branches out into multiple states of consciousness. Under the MMI, the reborn half can exist in a quantum superposition between both Taki and Mitsuha’s bodies from 1997 to 2013, thus allowing Taki to experience a separate state of consciousness from Mitsuha. In this manner, both Taki and Mitsuha are able to coexist in the same world, at the same time, as the same reborn half.
Although it seems like the body-swap phenomenon is a central element in the anime, Taki and Mitsuha’s body-swap never actually happens. The scenes where Taki seems to experience rural life were merely Taki’s recollections of his past as Mitsuha, while the scenes where Mitsuha seems to experience urban life were actually Taki living his own life. When Taki stumbles upon the remains of Itomori, the diary entries that Mitsuha had supposedly left in his phone start to vanish one by one until none are left (51:08). Since iPhones do not spontaneously delete data, this is actually a sign that Mitsuha’s diary entries on Taki’s phone never actually existed and that Taki was merely imagining them. As such, Mitsuha never actually switched with Taki to make those diary entries on his phone. Additionally, when Taki finds Mitsuha’s name on the records of those who died in the Itomori incident (52:33), he still manages to forget her name very shortly afterward (54:56). Furthermore, although Taki seemed to have Mitsuha’s name written on his hand only a month prior to his visit to Itomori (27:08) and seemed to have her name saved on his phone recently (41:41), he still cannot recall the name Mitsuha. This is peculiar because Taki should be able to recall a name that he has been noticing consistently over the past month. Hence, this suggests that Mitsuha’s name was never written down on Taki’s hand or saved in Taki’s phone in the first place. Since Taki had never encountered the name Mitsuha, he would not be able to remember it either. Thus, Mitsuha never actually lived as Taki, but it was Taki who always had a feminine side to him, having been reborn from half of Mitsuha’s soul. However, since Mitsuha never actually swapped places with Taki, it would have been impossible for her to find her way to Shinjuku to meet him on a train by pure chance. The scene of Mitsuha meeting with Taki in 2013 is animated as a blurry flashback, both voiced by and framed in the perspective of Mitsuha. In particular, the scene is shot with the center of the image in focus but the edges of the image blurred out (1:12:43), thus adding a dream-like quality to the entire sequence of events. Mitsuha wakes up from this exact dream at the beginning of the anime, right after the opening sequence (03:47). This suggests that Mitsuha’s meeting with Taki is a projection of Mitsuha’s desire to become a Tokyo boy, envisioned within a dream. Even in the dream, Mitsuha admits that there is no way for her to meet him and asks “What if we did (1:13:31)?” This indicates that Mitsuha is simply imagining what it would be like to meet a Tokyo boy. Hence, the body-swaps never actually happened and Mitsuha never actually meets Taki in 2013.
The anime explains Mitsuha’s time-travelling rebirth through the idea of the Musubi. The shrine god of the Miyamizu family understands Mitsuha’s resentment of rural life and decides to fulfil her dream of becoming a boy in Tokyo. The first clear indication of this comes when Mitsuha cries out to the stars in the night sky, asking to become a “handsome Tokyo boy in her next life (17:01).” While this line is an obvious reference to Taki, it also suggests that Taki is not merely any Tokyo boy, but specifically a Tokyo boy who is born from the same soul that Mitsuha possesses, thus embodying her next life. Also, this line foreshadows Mitsuha’s impending death a month later when the fragment of a comet destroys Itomori. In this way, Mitsuha’s wish to become a Tokyo boy can be read as a will that she leaves behind. The shrine god, represented by the comet Tiamat (1:00:53), then allows Mitsuha’s soul to go back in time to be reborn as Taki. In this sense, time is not linear. Hitoha, Mitsuha’s maternal grandmother, explains that time itself is like the braided cords – able to “twist, tangle, sometimes unravel, break and connect together again (34:56).” As a matter of fact, physicists have already discovered that time dilation, or time-bending, can be caused by changes in the gravitational potential, a phenomenon first predicted in Einstein’s theory of general relativity and extensively used in the 2014 science fiction film Interstellar. Since Mitsuha dies on the perigee of the comet Tiamat (33:20), the additional gravitational potential introduced by the passing comet thus warped time itself and allowed Mitsuha’s soul to travel from 2013 to 1997 and into Taki’s body. However, Mitsuha’s reincarnation as Taki is not nearly as straightforward as that. 
Mitsuha and Taki are not just the same soul, but more specifically, they share the same “reborn half” of the soul. Before her death, Mitsuha makes the Kuchikamizake out of her own saliva and brings the vial of sake to the shrine god’s resting place. Hitoha tells Mitsuha that the Kuchikamizake is “half of her” before she leaves it at the altar of the shrine god (36:35). The Kuchikamizake thus represents half of Mitsuha’s soul, which is preserved and protected from the meteor strike that later kills Mitsuha. In this manner, only the half of Mitsuha’s soul that was present in her body on the day of the meteor strike could reborn into Taki’s body. The remaining half of Mitsuha’s soul that resides at the shrine god’s altar is still to be found. This sets up the premise for the entire anime – Taki’s quest to regain the preserved half that Mitsuha had left behind prior to her death.  In fact, the anime frequently uses the imagery of the half and full moons to bring out the idea that Taki is essentially half of a soul searching for its other half. When Taki is busy drawing pictures of Itomori, there is a shot of the half moon in the sky (45:42). Also, when Taki visits Takayama-shi in an effort to find clues about his past, he is wearing a half moon shirt (48:53). This is in clear contrast to the scene in the opening sequence where a full moon hangs over Taki and Mitsuha, suggesting that they are two halves of a whole (02:05). In addition, when Taki and Mitsuha meet at twilight at the shrine crater, the full moon of the Akimatsuri hangs over them (1:22:37), indicating that at that brief moment of twilight, the two halves of the person have become one. In this way, the image of the moon represents the state of Taki’s soul throughout the anime. 	
Furthermore, Taki himself also becomes aware of the state of his own soul and the fact that he was reborn from half of Mitsuha’s soul. When Taki rediscovers the shrine crater, Taki himself comes to a realization that he is indeed Mitsuha and decides to save his past. At the shrine god altar, Taki looks at Yotsuha’s sake and then to Mitsuha’s sake, saying, “This is my sisters’ and this is mine (59:50).” This scene is crucial because it is the only time when Taki in the present refers to himself as Mitsuha. This is an important clue that Taki has, at this point, remembered that he once lived as a girl in Itomori in his past life. When Taki finally sees physical evidence of the shrine crater from his dream in the real world (58:48), he realizes that the fragmented memories of his past are real and that he really did live as a person called Mitsuha three years ago in a town that was destroyed. Then, Taki again refers to himself as Mitsuha when he pleads with the shrine god, “If time can be turned back, give me one more chance (1:00:33).” This line is important because Taki recognizes that he has entered the underworld (59:24) and understood that in order to return to the world of the living, he has to leave behind something that is most important to him (36:05). Taki has realized that the cost of regaining the missing half of his soul is exactly the very precious memory of Mitsuha, the past that he came to acquire in the first place. Stuck in this paradoxical position, Taki figures that the only way that he can save the memories of his past is to save Mitsuha, his past life, from the meteor strike. By doing so, he could open up the possibility that somehow, sometime in the future, the two halves of his soul might be able to meet again in the world of the living rather than the world of the dead. Then, when Musubi sends Taki back in time, Taki re-experiences his rebirth first-hand as he travels back in time to save Mitsuha. As Taki slips and falls in the shrine god altar, he experiences a flashback where he is dragged by a meteor that crashes into the earth (1:01:10).  Interestingly, the meteor and its trail resembles a sperm cell swimming toward an egg, fertilizing it and forming a new embryo (1:01:34). In this way, the 2013 meteor strike marks not only the end of Mitsuha’s old life but also the beginning of her new life as Taki. Hence, this association between the meteor strike and the natural birth process further establishes the idea that the meteor allowed Mitsuha to be reborn as Taki.
Kimi no Na wa thus tells the story of a girl who split her soul into two, preserves half of her soul, was reborn as a boy, and then searches, finds and rescues his preserved past self. It is a story that emphasizes the value of history in shaping identity, promotes the revitalization of old, long-established traditions and motivates the ongoing preservation of the images and stories of the present time.

                (I really tried to explain how that ""thing"" feels like.)
I really don't like to see those overrated animes. I don't why but, animes getting better until the score 8. But after the score 8, it goes worse.
I don't usually give low scores to animes. But this one is not an anime. So there is no problem.
Story
Let be honest there is nothing special about the story.
I can't even find the sentences to describe how basic it is.
Also, there are many questions about how those things are happening. The mystery... But I don't really care about those things. Because I generally watch animes for the characters I
                  don't really care about the story part but it was an average.
Story/Characters
This was the kind of story I really don't like. ""The puppets of the writer"". While watching the ""anime"", I really didn't understand why they are doing those things, why they are acting like that... I know, they love each-other but this is the worst part. Why they love each other... Because the writer wants it.
Characters
Most of the characters are the personalities I don't like. But it doesn't matter because they don't really have personalities. They are just puppets. It was like watching some characters that controlling by a child. None of them have feelings. I didn't feel anything while watching them. I couldn't make any connection with myself. They were empty.
Art/Sound
I don't give my art scores for how beautiful they are.
Art
As I said before this is not an anime. This is just a basic love story that has mysteries and drawn in anime(ish) style. The art is really nice to watch but that's all. If this was just an art competition, I would give it a 10. But the art of ""anime"" was absolutely bad. It doesn't even deserve a score.
The art in anime should make you feel the feelings of the characters. This is what makes it special. But It was just like watching people on the street. In real life, you can't know how people feel, but you should be able to see the feelings in an anime. You can see the feelings by using of many styles in an anime. Even with just using of the facial expressions. You may don't look like that in real life. But an anime doesn't care about how its look like in real life, it cares how it feels. But this was just like watching a movie with anime(ish) draw style. So It doesn't even deserve a score.
Sound
The sound was a little bit better but not enough. It was just like the Art.
Enjoyment
I didn't feel anything. I didn't even cry. I couldn't connect to any of characters. It was basic. I really don't understand why the people like this. But watching the ceiling is much better than watching this anime.
What is this?
Supernatural, mystery?
No, this is a love story.
Love story?
I didn't feel anything.
Feeling of the characters?
What characters? I didn't see anything alive.
I really should give this 1 but people worked really hard on it. So I'm going to give it 2.
Honestly, I couldn't even watch the ""Anime"". Because it keeps saying
""Watch me, give me 10. See that thing, it was beautiful right?!?! I am a masterpiece. You should give me 10. Give me 10. I'm a love story. I used everything to make me looks like a masterpiece. I'm not good but it doesn't matter because I'm the describe of a masterpiece.""",2,DeepDoge

                Your Name is the most recent film to have been created and released by acclaimed anime director, Makoto Shinkai. Focused on teenagers Mitsuha and Taki, Your Name is a romantic comedy-drama that sets up a Freaky Friday scenario where the two teens unexpectedly find themselves swapping bodies daily with one another.
Your Name's gimmick is focused on for a good part of the film's first half as it explores Mitsuha and Taki's lives and how the body swapping gets in the way of them. The film has enough time to explore the lives of both characters, showing how they live and what affects them daily with
                  Mitsuha being a rural teen hating her life in the boonies between serving as her town's priestess and considering her father embarrassing as her town's mayor, and Taki being a Tokyo resident with a part-time waiter job and having a crush on an older woman. The comedy also had its moments of effective humor with its body swapping. Outside of the shock of realizing the biological differences from body swapping, Taki and Mitsuha often find themselves meddling in ways the other would not normally behave and those within their lives take notice of the unusual quirks and actions that one of the leads commit while body swapped, lending to the film's humor.
As Your Name enters its second half though, the film's quality does take a hit for me as it takes on a more dramatic direction with its storytelling. Without spoiling too much, it adds a rather convoluted twist concerning the cause surrounding the body swapping between Mitsuha and Taki that stretches suspension of disbelief quite a bit. The movie's attempts to milk drama off this revelation came off feeling quite overboard and because Mitsuha and Taki never have direct interaction with one another for the majority of the film, this made Your Name's attempts to show off their budding attraction to one another come off as unconvincing for me. This is an issue that I have for a number of Makoto Shinkai's films since his attempt to add in some sort of paranormal gimmick for past works like Place Promised in Our Early Days and Children Who Chase Lost Voices stretches things quite a bit due to all his notable works focusing on a common theme of long-distance relationships, while I'm more a fan of his grounded works like 5 Centimeters per Second and Garden of Words.
Like Shinkai's past works, Your Name is a beautifully animated film to see in action with its gorgeous and highly-detailed scenic shots, effective use of lighting and shadow effects to create a convincingly atmospheric effect, and fluid animation depicting lifelike movements from the characters in both the urban and rural settings that Taki and Mitsuha respectively live in. Character designs are not as impressive to see in comparison, though they have a decent amount of visual details and have a plain look to fit in with the anime's mundane settings.
Ultimately, Your Name is yet another film that highlights the flaws of Makoto Shinkai's storytelling style when he chooses to milk any sort of paranormal gimmick with his usual focus on long-distance relationships. While I did get some laughs out of the awkward actions resulting from Taki and Mitsuha's body swapping in the film's first half, things eventually went downhill for me in its second half when the truth surrounding the body swapping was revealed and the attempt at a dramatic twist for the film came off looking overdone as a result. In spite of its hype, I would say my reception to Your Name is lukewarm at best and that the film might be getting more hype for it than deserved.",6,ggultra2764

                This is my first ever review on myanimelist but Kimi no Na wa is honestly one of the best anime movies I have ever seen. The beginning of the film was a bit confusing for me and I nearly fell asleep when I was watching the film but there was a certain scene that woke up, that scene gave me happiness about the true meaning of love and this movie shows every single aspect of that. I really enjoyed watching this film, there was also a bit of funny scenes during the movie but the best part of this film was the music that was
                  used during some scenes and man it got me into the feels train. I love the two protagonists of the film ( Mitsuha and Taki) because through these two it gave me hope about what love is all about, that even when time passes by, your feelings for the person you love will never go away, your incomplete without them. This is a must watch movie before you die, it's so sweet and overall it's a masterpiece that's gonna be in my top 5 for the best animes I've seen. 
I highly recommend that you guys actually give this a chance because this movie for me is a 10/10 and this is a really good movie for all my romance lovers out there. This is my first review and I hope this encourages someone to watch it because its just really good.

                Shinkai Makoto’s last movie, Kotonoha no Niwa (2013), was praised for its gorgeous animation, but criticized for being what many felt was “too short”. I beg to differ, but you all went out and said your piece, so Shinkai is back with Kimi no Na Wa, a movie that’s over ninety minutes long and really should have been a lot shorter. Its length ought to be manageable, but the poor romance plot makes an otherwise cute story a chore to slog through.
The basic gist of the film is that Mitsuha, the main female lead, lives in a small village with her grandmother and sisters. However,
                  she’s not all that content with her boring life, and wishes her reincarnation would be a handsome boy living in Tokyo. The next day she wakes up seemingly in aforementioned handsome Tokyo boy’s body – it seems as if Mitsuha and Taki, the boy, are randomly switching bodies. Time travel shenanigans later ensue. It should be pretty interesting – but unfortunately, it’s not. I’ll attempt to explain why in a bit.
Let’s start with the good parts, though. The animation is, as usual for a Shinkai film, very good. It’s fluid, crisp, clean. There are several nature shots that are so realistic it seems like they might be actual pictures. You get the gist – typical Shinkai fare by now, but we’re amazed every time regardless. I’ll say just one more thing about this: Kotonoha no Niwa’s animation was far more impressive to me.
Okay, I think that’s it. Now to the middling and bad.
The movie’s soundtrack is decent, though not entirely memorable. At least I enjoyed the vocal tracks this time around. The character designs are pretty typical. I personally consider them boring. The characterization is average at best – none of the characters really stick out or display any defining tics or traits. We don’t come to know them very well, apart from maybe Mitsuha. All the characters are pretty normal human beings, but as a result, they’re a little boring to follow.
The movie’s plot is good, if not completely original, but made unpalatable by what is arguably the worst part of the movie: the romance. It is, in a nutshell, terrible. There’s no chemistry between the characters. There’s not even an indication that the two might have a crush on each other. Heck, I’m inclined to say that Kimi no Na Wa’s romance portion is completely and utterly unnecessary. It feels tacked on, as if Shinkai just realized in the last thirty minutes that he really needs to get the two main leads together at the end…because reasons. Sure, you don’t necessarily fall in love because of tangible reasons, but it was difficult for me to believe the characters were in love by the end of the movie.
The blunt truth is that Kimi no Na Wa would have been a lot more interesting – and the romance a bit more relatable – if the movie were about how Mitsuha and Taki adjusted to switching bodies. But the movie isn’t about that: instead, we’re treated to a montage and some narration of how Mitsuha and Taki coped with the situation. There’s no finesse about it. It’s just a half-explored gimmick to make the movie seem cooler, and to make it longer. The last thirty to forty minutes are almost an entirely different film. It would have been a lot better to keep the two concepts in the movie separate, since Shinkai did not succeed in melding them together, in my opinion. In the end, the length of the movie and its unexplored, half-developed concepts really, really hurt the movie.
Kimi no Na Wa is one of the most overrated anime movie films of recent years. It is most certainly not Shinkai Makoto’s greatest work, and does not deserve to be called a magnum opus. People who call it original or breathtaking have clearly never seen the 2006 movie The Lake House – Hollywood, yes, and a remake of a Korean film, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s got a much better and more feasible romance in it. There’s no romance in Kimi no Na Wa, and as such, it fails as a romance movie. It also fails as a drama movie, since I did not feel connected to the characters. Overall, it’s saved from complete mediocrity by a serviceable OST and some pretty animation.",6,cherryjam

                Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one. - Albert Einstein
I really do wonder what was the genius physicist I admired so much on my childhood thinking about when he said that. What would later become a well renowned quote that many just I would cite and presented depending on how fitting it's the occasion. such deep thought and intriguing that begs the question onto what's real.
However it is the one thing that came to mind when I saw this film. Reality, Time, Identity and Romance all circle this very quote. Things that are very present on this film.
""Kimi no Na Wa"" or
                  ""Your Name "" It's a quite a controversial film, As it has climb up the charts at a unprecedented level even if it's MAL we are talking about. It has also taken Japanese theaters by storm and the film itself has outsripped various Ghibli films as globally aclaimed as they are and shove them behind them. It begs the question whether the film deserves all the hype or not after all. Is Makoto Shinkai a genius and is his work a work of art worthy of all the praise?.
FUNimation has acquired rights to it and plans to screen it on 2017. They've even gone as far as to enter the film for a Oscar nomination as strange as that sounds. as this development was happening I was wondering and asking myself, Is it really worth it?.
I'm a sucker for Gender Benders, Romance as long it has comedy and Ecchi. You can call that my guilty pleasure. So when I read the synopsis I was intrigued and honestly I didn't know what to make of it. It even annoyed me at some point because people wouldn't stop talking about. It's mere name irritated me to no end.
Like the obsessed Naruto fans and their Anime Gang Signs they throw out all day (LOL, I know it's Ninja shit). Anyway let's begin.
[SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD]
Plot: 6 / 10
After all I've said, You're probably flipping out. Why did I give this film at least for it's story a 6  / 10. Well the story revolves around two high school students from different places in Japan. Miyamazu Mitsuha a girl with city dreams who abhors the country life. there is nothing interesting going on and lacks absolutely everything that relates to entertainment. 
Kinda like a more grounded version and more humble of Megumi Shimizu from SHIKI. though this isn't as tragic, there is the sense of despair present for a time. regardless of which, she wishes she could escape the country life. Out right declaring on a shrine that she wishes to be a cute boy on the city as she wants to be on Tokyo. Why does she wanna be a guy on Tokyo? Who knows.  what we do know is that she has had recurring dreams on which she is a guy on the city. However while awake, she is told she acted quite bizarrely the previous day and she begins to question whether it was ever truly a dream to begin with or is something supernatural going on.
Her switch partner Tachibana Taki a city young man whom we really aren't told much about. He works multiple part time jobs and has a talent for drawing and subtly has been shown to harbor a slight desire to escape the city life for a bit. The body swapping allows both individuals to experience each other way of life, To gain experience and perhaps learn stuff that you'd normally wouldn't learn. As time goes by they leave each other notes about what they do on each others skin. leaving things written on each other bodies and/or cell phones and give each other tips on how to handle things.
Till one day, the messaging stops and so does the body swapping. Just to find out that Mitsuha the country girl and her town disappeared out of existence 3yrs ago and over 500 people died on a comet crash that erased the town. Now Taki becomes engulfed by the intrigue of how did he talk to the girl and to reach her and perhaps save her and her towns life from a deadly catastrophe.
Now although the plot is now evident. this films biggest issue is it's pacing and shaky focus. it doesn't know where it's heading at all. this anime swallows the world building and the how to of how in the world is soul switching by time travel even being done on the first place. 
Although from experience, Anime shown this way isn't about the plot but it's symbolic nature. Anime such as ""BokuMachi"" or ""Erased"" whole purpose was about dealing with regret and showcasing how it affects your future and can with hold you from achieving your best at your dreams. going as far as to intervene on your love life too. The plot of saving an old classmate was never important plot wise but it's symbolic nature of awareness of your surroundings.
This film constantly jumps around and whatever message it wants to get across gets lost on a white noise. There are traits of what perhaps are a desire to be with the same sex hinted from one of the characters and it's vaguely approached whether the experience is to be missed or was it simple lifestyle that somehow turn into romance as each one of the individuals live on each other skins and get to know each other from within.
one can argue that ""Kimi no Na Wa"" contains a coming of age element to it on which two youth are dealing with their place in the world as well as getting to know their identity better by living on each other skins. however it's execution it's quite poor. throughout the film you can't help but feel potential brimming but this films biggest mistake was to be a film. 
""Kimi no Na Wa"" was a mistake!. A TV show would have made this show stand truly atop as for now I perceive this show being graded on it's potential and what it could have been. Aside of being full of holes on regards to consistency and the set up to create a form of drama but coming out slightly above average.
Art: 8/10
The art is very good and the visuals are astounding. the characters designs are ok and aren't very important as the youths exist solely for whatever purpose the films wants to show you rather than have you get attached to them. basically a means to an end kind of thing.
Characters: 7/10
The characters are good and decently developed. However though bouth Tachibana Taki and Miyamazu Mitsuha hold a somewhat equal relevance you can't help but think ""Convenience"" aat their character dynamics despite their set up on regards to the past with each other.
The characters are designed to just be able to boost each other just enough but not enough to be memorable.
Enjoyment: 7/10
This film was enjoyable at the line of good but it was most certainly not perfect not masterpiece worthy. I was entertained by the first half of the movie and it's showcase on a different approach to body swapping / gender bender was these are quite rare to find as a whole, Trust me I've looked since it is my guilty pleasure.
To jumpy to what it wanted to accomplish and wrong expenditure of time for it's different themes of Gender Bending, Time Travel, Body Swapping, Identity and Romance. As I mentioned earlier, This should have been a TV Show.
Overall: 7/10
I give this Film a 7/10 since it's a most fitting score taking everything into consideration. Would I recommended? perhaps but people who don't care much about details. Meticulous people would be good for this film as they would enjoy it.
If you're here for the gender bending and it's showcasing on dynamics, It will be quite interesting but to be frank, As a enthusiast of this kind of theme. I shedded more tears at Maken-Ki Two Episode 0 approach and their portrayal of it's consequences better than how it is presented here.
If you're looking for fulfilling romance well, ""Ano Natsu de Matteru"" or ""Waiting in the Summer"" it's a hint for that. As per time travel well, It's just used as a means to and end and it will most certainly not be explained as it's just a vehicle to the what is happening in the plot and it requires you to look past it.",7,ChaoticThinker

                If you want to watch a movie, then I advise you to NOT watch this because this show... is a trainwreck. There are others like A Silent Voice or Pancreas.
Your Name is one of the MOST overrated anime movie ever made and I can’t just explain how so many people tend to love this garbage of a movie. 
There were actually people who cried when watching this anime and I have to say something to you if you cried: how? There was not even a single tearjerk moment, only garbage.
If you cried on this anime, there’s something wrong with you.
Now to explain why I hate
                  this movie, we’ll first start of with the:
Story.
Oh my god I can’t even understand a single fucking thing with the story, but here’s what I’ve remembered: 2 people who are students gets their places swapped everyday and comes back to their own bodies after that day and they try to like what, remember what their name is and to not forget about them. At first, it seems painfully average...
BUT when the time travel thing was revealed, the anime was just horrendously ruined. Like bro, that dude is swapping bodies with a girl who’s actually dead like what 3 years ago or something? That doesn’t even make sense in the slightest bit. I can’t even comprehend what the story is about anymore.
Characters:
The main characters are all fucking stupid, every single character is so bland and boring. Are they suffering from short term memory loss because of how easily they forget the name of each other? Come on, if you’re gonna make a character, make them somewhat interesting to the audience.
Art:
Now I’m gonna actually say something nice about this garbage. The art looks visually appealing. It’s nice, it’s cool, it’s like I had an eyegasm but that doesn’t mean the art will carry the score because I praised it. 
Sound:
Now we have one of the most iconic soundtracks ever made. They’re all bangers especially the very well known Zen Zen Zense, like come onnnn I love it.
Enjoyment:
Looking at my opinion on story and characters, do you really think I enjoyed it? Short answer. No. Long answer. There isn’t a single bit of this anime that was enjoyable and you know, the oppai squeezes when Taki’s on Mitsuha’s body is downright disgusting. (Although to be honest if I was on a female body, that would be one of the first things I would do.) I never enjoyed it and it was basically a waste of time. 
Overall: 2/10
This anime was just a huge waste of time. It’s definitely one of the worst ani-movies ever made. If you want a good movie, then don’t pick this one.

                ""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS""
Let's start pointing some details:
Although ""month and day"" + ""time of the day"" is shown on the protagonists mobile phones, full calendars don't exist, this might not seem to important but it IS. I could stop here. But MAL doesn't allow a review that short.
Following the above train of thought, Taki is 3 years older/younger than Mitsuha OR 3 years pass since the body switching stops and Taki going to Mitsuha's town, either way it's weird.
Why Mitsuha phone calling Taki fails?
E-mails don't exist either. It would have been cool if out of nowhere Taki would have received mails from an ""unknown sender""
                  3 years earlier/later
But to be honest my issue with this OVA/Movie/thing are not the plot holes the size of a comet... it's the slow pacing and the changing tone. It starts hinting drama with that opening of the protagonists searching for something/someone, changes to comedy with the body switching, goes back to drama with the reveal of the plot twist and then I don't even... know, the conflict presented in the twist is clear and at  same time the solution is too... mainly because the way it's presented initially nothing can be done, the story should end there, until it's revealed that something can be done, a deus ex machina moment if you will.
I find it jarring that the few ""action"" moments to resolve the plot twist issue are mixed with slow drama? moments that directly have nothing to do with the twist, basically the action moments focus on saving the town, but in between there are slow segments dealing with the protagonists trying to meet with a bit of the prior deus ex machina moment ""explanations"" sprinkled in. And finally the end part, Mitsuha hasn't forgotten about Taki but doesn't do anything about it!? but she decides? or it is just shown? that they walk one across the other several times until HE APPROACHES HER!?, then they say a few lines that bring nothing to the story and the movie ends... again this is a weird movie.
I guess there are several red flags:
It has several opening/ending video musical segments. Not none, not one at the end, or just one at the beginning and one at the end, around 3-4 I think
It has several, not short, segments of flashbacks and parts that repeat events that already happened
Lots of padding showing the ""vistas""",5,jouven

                Kimi no Na wa (Your Name)
Warning: This review may contain some spoilers.
I was so surprised when this movie reach the Top of MAL very quickly. I waited a few months to finally watch it.
The first half of the movie was a schoolar comedy about two teenagers than change bodies some days, we can appreciate the beautiful animation and the good music, also we can watch how is the Japanese life and the differences between the city and the countryside. The first half was very simple and funny. However, it had some errors, like the character's reaction were so unreal, also they don't try to communicate
                  to each other, but we forgive it because at the beggining it wasn't serious.
Then the second half happens and the drama beggins. We know Shinkai is good at direction but such a bad writer. The story has A LOT of plot twist. Like the girl is from the past, but when she was in the future she couldn't see the date? Even if she was using the boy's phone? Ridiculous. Then we talk to each other even if they are in different years because the power of love. We never know how she saves the village. The boy doesn't remember the name of the village even if he was there for almost two weeks. Nad then. we have an open final like that we saw before wasn't that ridiculous. 
Concluding, ""Your Name"" was a bad movie, with such a bad writing and a great production values, but that doesn't make it deserve it's position of ""The Best anime of All time"", you can watch it if you want ""PRETTY COLORS"", but if you want a good story, it doesn't deserve your time. Such an Overrated movie
If you like it, I recommend you any Makoto Shinkai movie.",4,Sasayaklin
32281,"
                So the movie that's made 11.19 million in just 2 weeks, does it deserve that income or is it just a flop. :) Well it's okay definitely an enjoyable movie but a little too fast paced at places. It's not perfect but it gets a message across. 
This film is wonderfully animated of course it's a shinkai film, it's gonna sparkle. This movie tried to build suspense at the end, would they meet and remember everything?? But it felt kinda just like yay at the end without any emotions, maybe because of the pacing. Of course it was emotional when Taki was trying to save
                  Mitsuha. But none of the characters were remarkable they we're just your average students with a scene done from freaky Friday every time they ""dream"". ⠀
So do I recommend it sure just most of the first half felt unnecessary, as it was just saying hey these are the characters. And the plummeting too fast 2nd half. If anything I will take this wonderful soundtrack away from this movie, and hey this started out like a great idea for a movie. But hey everyone has different opinions some of you will enjoy it more than I did.",7,Seasonalanime
32281,"
                Ok, so this is my first review up on MAL, but I think this movie deserves my first.
Makoto Shinkai, you've done it again. A work of beauty and marvellous storytelling. I won't summarise it since almost everyone else has, and plus, there's a synopsis for a reason. I will say, though, that the plot, though initially I thought was pretty generic, twisted its way right to my heart. How Shinkai transformed a seemingly bland story into a heart-wrenching movie that kept me on the edge of my seat was extraordinary. Given, Shinkai has extraordinary talent himself, producing titles like ""The Garden of Words"" and ""5
                  Centimetres per Second"", both on my all-time favourites list, so it's not exactly unexpected that he created this masterpiece.
I rated the story 10/10. Most people will probably disagree and say that the plot was unoriginal and bland, which I did mention above. I can't disagree, but the 10 comes from how Shinkai revamped the traditional plot of ""fantastical circumstance draws a boy and a girl together"". The twists kept me hooked and I almost cried when I learned that...oh wait, no spoilers...sorry. Without giving away too much, I loved how he addressed the issue of the time gap, providing a common ground for both MC's to coexist. I did cry when she dropped the pen, however.
EDIT - Story 9/10
I've watched Kimi no Na Wa close to ten times now - it's my all time favourite movie. However, closer inspection of the story does reveal time-honoured tropes and cliches that I did notice in my first viewing, but my lame excuse the first time was the blend of cliches were refreshing and blah blah blah. Now that I have basically memorized the whole movie, the cliches and scenes found in every movie did reveal a slight lack of imagination on Shinkai's part. Don't get me wrong, he's still a god. But I have noticed similarities in conveyance from other movies, like the ""boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy loses girl, boy finds girl, happy ending"". The ending was unnecessary - don't get me wrong, I also love happy endings - but the way they interacted *after impact* threw me off a bit. Mitsuha is supposed to be strong-willed, playful, and a bit of a tsundere, but her character in the end was so passive I almost didn't recognize her.
Was there any surprise that the art is a 10? Probably not. I don't have to elaborate on this one just because it's a Makoto Shinkai film. Enough said. Beautiful.
The sound was a 7/10, the weakest category, but still good nonetheless. Others have said it, and I'll repeat it. The song choices were good, fit with the mood, and overall enhanced the scenes they were played with. However, after the fact, I'm not humming the tunes of any of them; they're just not that memorable. No offence, but if I heard any of them again, I probably wouldn't recognise them. In the movie, though, they were appreciated and complemented their respective scenes well.
EDIT - Sound 10/10
I lied. They're very memorable. I have bought the whole soundtrack, both original and piano scores :p. I can sing/hum all the main songs - Yumetourou, ZenZenSense, Mitsuha no Theme, Kataware Doki, SPARKLE, and Nandemonaiya - by heart. No further elaboration required.
The characters in the movie are well deserving of an 8/10, nine might be pushing it a little. The characters are a boy and a girl of the same high school age. The boy lives in the city and the girl lives in the countryside. Being of that adolescent age, they are naturally somewhat shy when it comes to feelings and love, but still adventurous enough to climb mountains by themselves. Let me talk about Taki, the boy, first. Only child, single parent who doesn't seem to care a whole lot, works long hours, has a few friends, and is diligent when he sets his mind to something. Voiced by the giant baby from Spirited Away who everyone loves, Taki was voiced well. Ryunosuke did a good job portraying surprise, endearment, and despair. He also did a pretty good job of sounding like a girl with a guy's vocal chords. Taki himself gets a 9 for being a good, solid MC. Now for Mitsuha, the shrine maiden from the country. Her family was estranged, and she lives with her traditional oba-chan (if you don't understand, get off MAL...just kidding). She's a little unorthodox compared to the rest of the community, and has a bit of a wild streak. What makes her a great character is that she's a tsundere...haha. What actually makes her a great character is her headstrong attitude, the seriousness to do what she sets her mind to. Like Taki, she is diligent at what she does, but she just does it better. Ups and downs are not uncommon for Mitsuha, but she will go to great lengths to meet Taki. She's voiced by Mone Kamishiraishi, a relatively new voice actress if MAL's actor/actress information is correct (she's 18!!!). Individually, Mitsuha is a 9.5. You're probably thinking ""ok, if they're a 9 and a 9.5, why is the character rating only an 8?"" The answer is that both these characters are pretty static throughout the movie. The development is just not strong enough. Their attitudes only change superficially according to the mood (ie. comedic relief) and no change internally really happens. The fact that they started off as really strong characters saved their score, but in order for them to be a 10, they should be dynamic, changing their outlook somewhere in the plot line. It just doesn't happen for me, so it's an 8.
EDIT - Character 9/10
I just bumped it up because I realized I wasn't giving enough credit to the seiyuu's for acting like the opposite gender. And, I felt attached to both of them. Mind you, however, Shinkai did mention in a recent interview that he may have emotionally manipulated the audience...
The enjoyment on ""Kimi no Na Wa"" is a 10. If I had a scouter and my name was Vegeta, this would've been over 9000. Hehe. Anyways, back to the point. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for numerous reasons: (1) Makoto Shinkai is a god, (2) I'm a sucker for romance, (3) I'm an even bigger sucker for twists and reveals, (4) The art and animation was outstanding, (5) The characters followed their hearts, and I'm a huge sucker for that, (6) The plot blends really smoothly and has a lot of depth...as you can see, I can go on forever. But I won't. What I will say about my enjoyment of this movie is that it really does hold a spot in my heart now.
Thank you Makoto Shinkai for yet another breathtaking movie, and I look forward anxiously at your next release. I hope you found this review insightful, and you'd better watch the movie.
EDIT
I recently came back from Shinjuku, Japan, and I spent 5 days in that area, not to mention Akihabara, only a 20ish minute train ride. Anyways, aside from immersing myself in Akiba, and shopping my ass off, I went to a theatre that happened to be steps from my hotel. You can only guess what I watched. No English subs? No problem, I have the movie basically memorized. Every aspect of it was enhanced, and I cried three separate times I think. I took a peek at everyone else's face (it was still showing after almost half a year, and THE THEATRE WAS FULL)  they were all wet with tears, or showed the remnants of tears. Man, I love this movie.",10,canyouread

                First things first, calling this movie is an understatement. This movie would be 11/10 if there was that option. This is no joke one of the best anime movies I have seen. HELL! I just made a MAL account just so I could review this gem of a movie. This stunning film is Makoto Shinkai’s best film yet, and that's saying A LOT. 
 It took me on a rollercoaster of feels and tears. The plot, the sound, the art, the characters and the cinematography, they all took my breath away. I had a myriad of feelings from every aspect of this film. I highly
                  recommend just forgetting reading reviews if you haven’t seen it, as this gold deserves not to be spoiled. However, since you are here, I'm going to write one and make sure you damn see it. Don’t worry~ it's spoiler free ;) 
Art: Charming. From just the opening sequences my heart jumped in excitement. The colour Makoto Shinkai brings to his films are unlike any other. You can see how much work went into every aspect of this film, but especially the art. The scenery was mind-blowingly artistic and beautiful, creating a beautiful esthetic. Crisp and utterly beautiful. I especially loved how the scenery and art were used. The cinematography at points was like a drug to me. Such beautiful animation should be illegal. 
BTW: For those who have seen a lot of anime of similar genre, the art may look very familiar. The character designer was Takana Masayoshi also known for the design of AnoHana and Ano Natsu De Matteru. Indeed this only just added to the charm (and also the feelz).
Characters: Somehow Makoto Shinkai made these beautiful loving characters through what seemed to be very little scene time. By about 30 min in I already LOVED the characters and their qualities. Sure, I would have loved to see more but within a movie like this a director doesn’t usually have that much connection time to establish such colourful characters within such a complex plot. Yet Makoto Shinkai managed to do it (claps). Movies like this usually have such rushed character development and I was really worried coming into this movie that this movie would fall under such category, however, this movie delivered way more than asked. 
Plot: I really don’t want to spoil this. Seriously. But what seems to be quite a simple premise is just SO MUCH MORE. Adding to the gold, the plot and story are just magnificent. New and original, quite unpredictable, the plot grabs you and takes you. Literally takes you on a journey. Reading the synopsis you may think that this is a typical romance movie with a slight twist. It really isn’t! its romance but it doesn’t have the sort of cliché you are thinking of. I love seeing such original content such as this, really warms my heart.  
Sound: I feel that a lot of people may not 100% enjoy this aspect of the movie as it actually played quite a large role. However saying that I'm not one of those people. For me, it added to the feels and the enjoyment of the film. It was seriously beautiful and fit perfectly with the aesthetic of the film. There were points within the film where I was like “oh okay… music” as it was quite abrupt however overall it added to the film. 
Overall this movie takes the cake. All the cake. From every aspect, it was just beautiful. Sure you might think this is going to be a typical rom-com however it really isn’t. I full heartedly say: watch this movie! From day one, after seeing the trailers and poster art, I knew this movie was going to be gold (and it was).  Freaking beautiful.",10,Norakoo

                The Story
There was a fairly nice idea behind Kimi no Na wa, an idea unfortunately impossible to realize without shamelessly dumbing down the story and its characters, creating enormous plot holes, and inevitably never addressing them — at least impossible within this movie's setting.
It's not like the plot of this movie is flawed, no. It's that the plot of this movie operates within a fundamentally problematic context. Up until half of its duration, it strictly relies on the characters' ignorance and poor decisions to essentially cheat its way into creating plot twists, which in turn enable the plot to progress. After the first half, the
                  movie begins cheating in different ways, such as resolving the tension off-screen and literally using the exact same plot device used in the first half over... and over... and over again.
Speaking of repetition and plot twists, did I mention how this movie has (I think) 4 separate climaxes? That's right, Kimi no Na wa wasn't satisfied with a conventional format, probably because its concept alone wasn’t able to provide enough substance. The story reaches a climax, and then immediately starts building up tension for the next one. The result, of course, was that I became exhausted due to the movie feeling like it lasted twice as long. Each time it seemed to be coming to a close and I settled into the appropriate mood, it simply reset itself and kept going.
Shinkai Makoto made some basic attempts at implementing metaphors and symbolism to more clearly define the philosophy behind Kimi no Na wa, but again, instead of being subtly scattered throughout the movie, they were aggressively pointed at the audience in a repetitive manner.
Similarly, the final and real climax of the story is unnecessarily dragged out in an attempt to build up more tension, despite the ending being blatantly obvious since the movie entered its third quarter.
The Characters
It'd been suggested to me that the right way to watch this movie is by trying to shut off your brain and ignore the messy, nonsensical parts of the story along with its various plot holes. However, I found this extremely difficult to do, as the two main characters remained completely unexplored, leaving nothing else to focus on.
We learn nothing of Taki's backstory and almost nothing of Mitsuha's backstory. There's no character development, and there isn't any depth or extra dimension added to them. The only thing that develops is their inevitable romantic relationship. They are completely driven by the supernatural phenomenon surrounding them, which also acts as the central plot device for the story to move forward.
That said, despite lacking any sort of depth or complexity, all of the characters' general behavior was surprisingly natural — that is, when they were not falling victims of plot-induced stupidity or amnesia — which gave off a sense of familiarity that was pretty refreshing. In fact, the brightest part of the writing in Kimi no Na wa lies within its supporting characters. Supporting characters, in addition to being distinct enough, were efficiently involved with the main characters and the plot in a very smooth and natural way.
Art & Sound
Perhaps the best known and most agreed upon aspect of Kimi no Na wa is the quality of the art and animation CoMix Wave Films managed to pull through. Although there are certain scenes wherein the effort they put forth felt lesser compared to the rest of the film, it mostly looks amazingly beautiful, and I doubt anyone can have any major complaints in this regard.
The most remarkable part of the movie's sound section, in my opinion, is the great work the voice actors did to demonstrate how Mitsuha would express herself through Taki's voice and vice versa. The soundtrack wasn't the most memorable I've ever heard but, for the most part, it fulfilled its purpose, even though I personally found the vocal parts to be a bit distracting and not really to my liking. 
Conclusion
Overall, I see what Shinkai was trying to do and I like the idea, but it just doesn't work. Kimi no Na wa ends up being a spectacle with little substance, a show that is merely trying to impress (often by tricking its audience in cheap ways). Had Shinkai readjusted the narrative's focus and the story's setting once he faced all these glaring issues, then perhaps he could have turned this concept into something somewhat functional. I feel quite disappointed with the outcome of his film, considering its budget and all the hype it instantly received.

                Kimi no Na Wa.
Another masterpiece, done by Makoto Shinkai.
This is my first ever review I've ever done so go easy on me :3, and also it's my first ever anime I've rated a masterpiece or 10/10
This anime movie had many aspects that were 'perfect'. The background music done by RADWIMPS were well done and the ost's that they have produced are top of the anime ost lists. People may believe this anime was over hyped but I believed that a beautiful anime like this wasn't hyped enough. If you're interested in the states and how well this anime has done, this anime made roughly 1.3
                  billion yen on the first day of the movie coming out.
The story line that was developed was fairly complicated compared to many other romance animes that are out there, The techniques that were used very professionally like for example 'time travel'.
One of the most impressive things about this movie was the visuals, most animes aren't able to afford such animation like Kimi no Na Wa so we are blessed to view such animation. Unfourtnletly I don't live in Japan so I'm not able to view the quality that I wished to and I missed a few amazing 'mise en scenes' due to the lack of quality that I had. Never less I still did view the anime in the quality '720p' which is still amazing. 
The plot was unpredictable, at the start, i thought I was able to predict most of the anime but I was wrong, I should have expected Makoto Shinkai to throw a few curve balls at us.  
Well, that concludes my review I understand that I missed many important and essential details about the movie, but in the end, if you still haven't watched it yet I highly recommend watching the film :3.",10,TheHeckle

                This is my first anime review ever, well ""here we go,"" as Mario yells. Anyway apparently this is hailed by this website and IMDB as the greatest anime ever based on average numerical scores given by users. It is also the highest grossing anime film of all time raking in about $360 million in box office totals. Well I can say I did not find this film amazing, or even that good to be honest, it was merely above average. There are many significant flaws that prevent this film from being considered great in my opinion and or ""magical"" that so many people hype it
                  up to be.
First,  the story. It's pretty simple a boy and a girl are able to switch bodies with each other and the way they handle some situations is rather comical. This was displayed in the beginning and these were the best parts of the movie how the boy and girl adapt to changes in their body switches and environmental changes. Then apparently, the boy and girl want to meet together but the boy finds out through the book of records after he visits the town (itomori) that the town was blown apart by a comet. The big issue I have with the story is there is no sense of conflict or tension at all. SPOILERS AHEAD!! The boy confesses his love to the girl by writing on her hand only the problem is the boy is 3 years behind the girl in the timeline hence he cannot communicate with her (via phone or in person). The part I don't understand is how he is able to actually meet her though at some point if they are ""supposed"" to be three years apart. I bet this made people all teary eyed but all I felt was my butt itching because the movie's story was that forgettable and plain. Honestly I didn't feel any emotional attachment to the story or characters which is another big issue. 
The characters were extremely flat and lifeless. Apparently I'm supposed to feel for them. But they have no interesting qualities; the boy is your regular city high schooler and the girl is just some country side girl. They don't do anything particularly exciting, heroic, dangerous, or even what I would consider funny (accept adapting to some changes in body switching). The side characters aren’t much better either. Oderu was the only somewhat interesting characters but she didn’t have that much screen time. Were there even antagonists in the story? What, is the comet supposed to be the antagonist? The two main characters are the most plain and average people you could ever find on any given day nothing movie worthy about them at all really. I don't want to see a movie about that. I go watch movies and anime to see danger, excitement, fear of the unknown, drama, comedy. But here the characters display none of that. The only good character in this movie was the comet which didn't even have a single line of dialogue. I wished the comet just killed everybody so the movie would end quicker. This movie also had the most anticlimactic and dry ending on the planet like really? Come on now.
An area where this movie truly shines is the art and animation of the movie. Makoto Shinkai paid great attention to detail and the backgrounds are truly beautiful to look at with almost every detail drawn to sublime perfection. Trees and leaves have little droplets of water glistening on them, mountain ranges with proper bumps and curvatures, and characters that actually look like humans instead of freakish caricatures. Also the animation was good as well. Characters show facial changes when speaking and smooth transitions in their movement, and fluid transitions of moving objects. It was very well drawn for the most part of it and high quality art was implemented in the movie.
The music was ok nothing really that great just some basic J-pop by the band Radwimps which sounds like any typical anime OP. The music didn't convey any emotional impact on the viewer either just like the story and bland characters. Anime in which the music conveys an emotional impact on the viewers and builds upon the greatness of the anime is Perfect Blue. Perfect Blue has a very cheery opening with rather deep lyrics reminiscent of 90s J-pop but it sets a somewhat melancholic tone to the movie plus the background music during most of the movies scary parts sends chills down my spine with its ominous ambience. Ninja Scroll directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri would not be as good or great if not for the epic background music attached to the very violent and brutal fight scenes. The music in those films elevates those films to levels of greatness rather than just good or above average. Music in movies can really change the entire mood of how a scene is presented, but here it doesn’t really do anything. The music here just doesn't leave any impact on the viewer and it's as cookie cutter as it comes not bad just plain and boring. The music here cannot hold a finger to any Disney movies in terms of music but that’s a completely different rant for now.
Overall, I didn't outright hate this movie but I didn't like it that much either. The story and pacing weren't good and even though this movie was only an hour and forty six minutes long it felt much longer due to the unconvincing story and dry characters. This movie is like vanilla ice cream it's edible but is it the be-all and end-all of food? Not a chance. What I enjoyed about this movie were the great visuals. Everything looked stunning and was pretty to look at. The issue is though none of it had much substance. Makoto Shinkai basically created a visual movie (maybe drawing tutorial). The visuals are beautiful and nice to look at but is there really any substance behind it? Makoto Shinkai is definitely no Miyazaki, Kawajiri, or Satoshi Kon (RIP). Good artwork but he needs to focus on making interesting characters for a story like this to work which he didn't. Maybe I came in with too high expectations? That is possible but for such a highly rated and acclaimed film I just didn’t think it was all that special or exciting.",6,HarryRambod22

                This was one of the good ones I've watched. Nevertheless, the only unexpected twist was in the moment when Taki realized that what he saw happened 3 years ago. Also the time-line twist is fairly original mixed with switching bodies and the addition of religion was somewhat interesting (not my taste but fairly interesting). 
Characters development was somewhat disregarded and other then being body-switching individuals - the main characters had no personality traits that stand out.
I gave it overall ate because even if the topic of the story was not very original, it was actually interesting to watch and the whole story wasn't monotone and
                  it felt like it has 4 stages:
1. Everyday life and body-switching
2. Meteor disaster
3. Realization and going back in time
4. Present time where they both meet at the same point in time-line
I find this to be very good story development with very little or none loop holes in the story.",8,Lillith_Letrange

“Elegant. Amusing. Moving.” – Ojii-san
Imagine yourself in a dream as another person without knowing it was reality that allows you to do the things you always dreamed of by using another’s life but later to draw affection towards one another. This was the plot line of Kimi no na wa (Your Name). Not much words come to mind when describing a movie like this. It is simply stunning. This movie will trigger many of your emotions from happy to sad. As we follow the main characters, Taki and Mitsuha in an amusing adventure as they are able to switch bodies through sleep and get to know about each other’s friends, family and their lives. It seemed at the beginning it was all fun and games, the mentality as if you were in a dream. However, the story started to escalate after the two knew it was more than just a dream, it was reality. After time passed the two main characters drew feeling for one another and promised to write a note on their next switch. The switch never happened. They weren’t able to confess to one another and at that time on, as every second passes a little more of what you recall is lost, just like a dream. The reason why they were not able to switch bodies anymore is for you to find out. This movie presents the struggle to see, save, remember and be with the one you truly care for one last time.

                The story isn't anything special but the execution of it was good mainly because of how great the character design is. The characters are normal and don't really have anything super crazy so when they start to understand their feelings despite the fictional tone of it it's still pretty easy to relate and feel the same feelings that the main characters are feeling in those scenes. 
I think the romance could have been done better Makoto Shinkai has this strange obsession with waiting until the end for the relationship to develop into something more which is kind of a double edged sword for him. On
                  one end the impact of the development is much stronger on the other hand there isn't much time left in the movie for the viewer to experience the two characters as a couple rather than two people who kinda like eachother. I think he pulled it off better in this film than he does in other films but I still felt pretty unsatisfied with how it turned out and it's definitely something I hope he does differently in the future although I doubt it.
But the main draw to this movie is undoubtedly the animation. Which is absolutely stunning and probably his best so far. The colors change depending on the mood as well as the style of cinematography. When the scene is supposed to be happy and lighthearted there are lots of fast cuts and when it's supposed to be more emotional and sad it will stay on one camera angle for longer periods of time to make it more impactful. Which is nothing super special but I think a lot of animators get lazy with that kind of thing nowadays and I figured it was worth mentioning. 
Overall I think this movie is worth watching it's my favorite Makoto Shinkai film so far and will probably make my top list for 2016. I'm going to give it an 8/10.

                I don't understand how this movie got so high up the ratings. I watched it because it looked popular and had a very high rating but I couldn't even finish it. There were parts that were so dumb I had to skip past them because I felt like shutting it off there and just not watching the rest. 
If you're only going to watch this because of it's popularity, DON'T! I'm starting to think it was a website malfunction that put this at the top of the list because it sure doesn't compare to some of the other stuff that is lower down the rating.

                tl;dr An unoriginal story that runs too long, but somehow pulls it out in the end. I, admittedly and perhaps incorrectly, round up to rate this a 6/10.
Disclaimer: It would be very difficult to write a full review on this without letting go some spoilers. So if I have revealed anything after this point, you have been warned. In order to avoid major spoilers, I've clipped them from this review, and thus generalized the review considerably.
Your Name is an anime movie that swims in very familiar waters. The main themes are all fairly common and the major plot points and twists have all been done
                  before. In every instance of this film, the plot points and themes have been done better elsewhere. One of the main points of the movie is the theme of body swapping between a male and female. Although there are enjoyable moments, this movie adds nothing to its respective genres and leaves no memorable contribution to the primary body swap theme. I liken this to a generic drama movie that's made and quickly forgotten in a market already saturated with better movies.
Like the body swap theme, there are numerous other devices employed in this movie that just do not live up to other examples nor does the movie excel in any category it attempts. 
*Slice of life? subtle way of saying the plot is disjointedly jumping between two people's lives. 
*Comedy? funny moments exist here and there, but nothing to take home. 
*School? guy looking out of window/10.
*Supernatural? one aspect with no explanation, one of the weaker points of the movie.
*Romance? One interchange that abruptly ends, main romance never gets off the ground.
*Drama? There are a handful of ""emotional"" moments that are hardly impacting, akin to being punched by a 4 year old. Mostly due to disjointed storytelling. 
There are more themes, though I will stop here as I want to try and avoid spoilers. Every category falls short of the spark that prompts a ""this is great"" feeling. I found the movie to be rather average on its own, lesser so when compared to similar (read: better) movies. And at the end, the sum is no greater than its mediocre parts. 
For the time length and medium in which this anime is presented (a 1 hour 46 minute long movie), it doesn't do a whole lot to impress. One of my major complaints prompted me to pause the movie when I wondered how long I had been watching without the movie reaching any plot point. The time was just shy of the 35 minute mark. And I don't mean that the main plot point doesn't show up until 40 minutes in, I mean that for 40 straight minutes there is no semblance of a plot. I'm ok with letting a story run on it's own, but the one little note that is dangled in front of you (that she was acting weird yesterday) was not enticing enough to fan interest. 
Often the movie skips around or back and forth between the two body swappers. Sometimes the movie does this successfully, other times it simply does not. The direction frequently brings the viewer back to one scene then carries on with the plot, but then loops back to the one scene. It feels disjointed at times, and for me anyways, takes the viewer out of the role of observer and into the thought of ""how much longer are we going to stretch this scene.."" I won't say that the movie drags, because it keeps going forward, but it feels like the plot is just going through the motions. And when the end finally comes, the movie just ends, instead of showing what it is supposed to show.
Or to put it another way, it's like you are being driven to the store to get some milk, only the driver decides to take the long way around, stopping frequently at other locations, eventually having to get gas because you've traveled so far, then finally getting to the store only to find that the store is now closed and you have to go home, empty handed.
Frankly, this movie is far too long and makes an inappropriate use of time.
The art is good and the cinematography is one of the finer points of the movie. Sound quality is good and the voice acting is believable and professionally done. No complaints there. In fact I'd have to praise the two main characters for a job well done on the body swap scenes. The dialog isn't forced and there are many examples of good conversational exchanges among the various characters. Worth noting that the character designs are good, only they lack any real development or change within the movie (we are only shown the result of change that takes place off camera). There is ample room to focus on a few supporting characters, and the film attempts to do that, but doesn't succeed.
When it comes down to it, the improper use of time and poorly conveyed plot drag considerably on what can be considered an intriguing but unmemorable use of what we Americans would call a ""freaky friday"" trope (the body swap). Weighing the base parts against my overall enjoyment, I would rate this a pretty shaky 5.5 out of 10 and seeing as how we cannot select half scores I have to split hairs. I don't think this movie deserves a 6, but I cannot justify giving it as low of a rating as a 5 for the animation and production (minus story/directing). Admittedly, I might be rating this too high, but I give it a 6/10.
Final thoughts: Had I found this prior to having watched so many titles and examples of the themes employed within this movie, I might feel more passionate as to rate this a solid 6 or even a 7 out of 10. But I cannot rate this that high against other examples. When I rustle up the strongest impression I have from this movie, I remember frequently wondering how much longer the movie had to go before the end. So much so that near a certain point, I found myself rooting for the meteor.
Post review thoughts:
I would recommend instead to watch Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo (Yamada and the 7 witches) If you are looking for a body swap trope with a school life and romance theme, I honestly think they do a better job. And to give context to my recommendation, I rated that show an 8. You might say comparing a movie to a series is apples and oranges; I'd counter that I'm comparing an ok apple to a good orange, respectively.

It has many things as same as the anime 5cm/s has, you can see some familiar backgrounds, blossoms drop, the comet, the childhood's love....Two characters are far from each others, two times the boy turns back, but only once the girl reply to it :(

                For many years a have thought that Spirited Away (千と千尋の神隠し) was the best anime film ever made. We had waited 16 years to change our mind and now I am able to say that Your name (君の名は) is now the best anime film to date, even if this year didn't receive an Anne or an Oscar.
The story argument is simple and clear. Sometimes the simplest story creates a narrative that will entertain all the persons for a couple hours. 
For some sort of the destiny, two persons (Take and Mitsuha) are bound with the lace of the fate and time, they will find themselves in
                  their dreams and in their life, they change their soul and heart and share experiences that will create a bond that at the end will change the past, present, and future. That's the simple argument captured in this film. These changes affect the space and time, they switch their bodies, and from time to time they start to love each other, and if they forget their names the wheel of the time will reunite them one more time. Story 8/10
To create these bonds, it was needed to share an outstanding art. This film has a clever use of lighting, combined with very detailed landscapes that immerse the watcher in the story waiting for a development that takes some time. 
About the sound, it is good. The songs and the whole OST is great and combines the simplicity of the story and the quality of the art creating a film that will stay with us for a long time. 
Finally, the character development isn't the strong part of the film. We need to understand that is a film adapted from a graphic novel for these reasons, maybe some characters aren't that complex as they should be. The story doesn't require a complex character development so adding more complexity and background to the characters would have affected the final narrative.  
In summary, you should watch it to have two hours of enjoyment and to see a great narrative in action. Now we need to wait other 16 years to see a anime film that could be better than this one.",9,Pipe

                Story: IMHO, it was very good. I wished it wasn't centered on supernatural, but overall, I think it's a great movie with a subtle incorporation of romance. I believe that the plot is very straightforward, and that it won't leave you scratching your head. It wasn't the most brilliant (at least the ending wasn't as romantic as I hoped) but it's Makoto Shinkai we are talking about here, famous for 5 cm/s. As always, the ending is up to your interpretation, but unforunately, happy romantic endings and Makoto Shinkai do not go hand in hand. ALL I WANTED WAS 1 KISS SCENE AT THE END,
                  AND I COULD REST IN PEACE.
Art: I mostly watch anime that are realistic. 5 cm/s, Oregairu, Tari Tari, Hyouka, to name a few. I think that it's a lovely depiction of life with the artwork. Hands down, no flying characters and any kicks that send a character flying ten miles. The colors of the comet were also a major bonus in my eyes.
Sound: I usually don't grade much on sound, but Zen Zen Zense by RADWIMPS was simply amazing. When I heard it first in the trailer, that was the main reason for drawing me in. Trailers are usually amazing but a lot don't accurately depict the movie excitement, but you won't be disappointed by Kimi no Na Wa.
Characters: Pretty typical high school characters. Taki is your average day high schooler studying architecture and has a part time job, and Mitsuha is a girl living in a small town raised with traditional practices. Kind of rushed in the description of the characters, but I think they were very simple and to the point with both of them. Developed, but could use a tad bit more IMO.
Enjoyment: Hmm. Once more, I enjoyed it a large extent. I hate ambiguous endings (although this one implies that it's a happy one), I prefer anime that have at least a romance ending. Perhaps it's because I dislike melancholic things, even something like Fruits of Grisaia had an upbeat ending, despite behind psychological-themed. I JUST WANTED A ROMANTIC ENDING, but it's Shinkai running the show. I didn't find out until after I watched it, I was very certain it mirrored 5 cm/s at the end so I had a hunch.
Overall: Definitely would recommend to anybody. If you hate ambiguous endings like me and would bang your head against the wall if you don't get the ending you want, I'd advise caution. I'm glad I saw it, but I'll be melancholic since the anime ended on a amorphous note.",8,iAquaphoria

                Genuinely don't understand the hype. It was very pretty, but the story was the most generic done-to-death romance story in which nothing really happened and continued to not really happen and then it was over after a really cheesy ""Can I ask... your name!?!?"" line.
I honestly couldn't tell you a single thing about any of the characters personalities because they had none, other than teehee boy gropes his own boobies.
The art style was very good and the sound design also was. I didn't really care for the pop songs in OST for the most part though, but that is a personal taste thing. You can

The other anime I have watched has only brought me up to the point where I feel a bit of heartache for a few minutes and that's all. However with this anime my eyes watered up and I was at the edge of my seat for most of the second half of the anime. Its nicely paced it starts out nice and at
                  a slower pace but then gradually builds up momentum in the plot in a way that I feel works for it. This is easily my number one anime movie and my top ten anime it will be a hard one to knock off my lists.

                *Minor Spoilers*
Makoto Shinkai put a lot of effort into crafting a well written, well drawn movie that was sure to pique a lot of interest. And today even 3 years later Your Name is among one of the most talked about and praised anime movies of the decade. In Shinkai's areas of expertise he really excelled at drawing something both well executed and beautiful. But in other areas, his movie loses a lot of the value and artistry it deserves. Though Your Name had a ton of potential to be a lasting and enduring piece, too much of the movie is sacrificed for the feel-good
                  aesthetic the movie attempts to showcase.
Positively, the art and music is Your Name's greatest exhibit. Scenes of the landscapes and in betweens are thoroughly drawn and don't fail to impress. Like Shinkai's previous works, Your Name is gratifyingly well made and nudges the limit to anime as an art medium. The music wasn't too impressive to me I'll admit, but it was enjoyable enough to take note of as well. Some might say his music was more enduring than the movie itself.
Shinkai's center stage is the plot. I'd wager we've all dreamt of a show in our youths as quirky and provoking as what Shinkai had laid out in Your Name. Overall, the premise is interesting enough to learn more about. Despite the NUMEROUS plot holes and questionable moments, it still has some worth. But I'd say by the end I was a little more confused by how strangely the movie took a turn, though it definitely had potential to arrive at something truly satisfying.
What made everything so hard to appreciate, in my opinion, surely has to be the character designs. Taki and Mitsuha are both extremely unoriginal school students. I bet you had forgotten the guy's name before I had mentioned it. The Anime meta has always been to romanticize the life of a typical, normal school teenager because audiences will relate to and sympathize with them more closely. Which is fine, but there is literally no interesting aspect about either main character, so there's nothing to care about in the first place. Shinkai cleverly presents the illusion of some sort of character development by scribbling up some initial love interest and implying that Taki has changed because he's now in love with Mitsuha, but literally nothing has developed within him in the first place. If you were in that bizarre of a situation with someone at least somewhat romantically compatible I'm sure you'd fall in love too, with or without a crush. The glorification of this half baked plot isn't enough to testify why Taki or Mitsuha is any reason to care at all. If this movie featured 2 guys it'd probably lose most of its credence. I'd give Shinkai the benefit of the doubt with how he chose to write the latter half of the movie, but one could argue no matter what path they took, the characters weren't interesting enough anyway to really make a mark. This anime falls short in both plot and characters, and all that's left is really just eye grabbing content.
Overall I'd probably enjoy the movie a lot more had there been less of the plot to really be concerned about and more of the characters to resonate with, but in short Your name has at least done its job of surviving as a mediocre movie with enough points on the checklist to warrant a popular anime.",5,pumpkinboy

                  While this has a nice little unique factor, they travel around to try to find one another again. This is fairly bland and lacks any sophistication or suspense because with generic movies and shows like this, it always ends happily. The predictability of the story and unoriginality of the structure leads me to believe that it is a fair 6.
Art: There is no competition when it comes to this animes artwork it is a masterpiece. 10
Character Growth: Taking into consideration that this is a movie and not a show of decent length I feel that it is fair to be lenient with this section. Taki is the only person in the show who really develops and matures and that is evident throughout the trials that he puts up with. However, the screen time after conclusive events for the other characters are drastically cut short leading for only one character who actually changed out of the 2 who star in the movie. 8 Very Good.
You do not have to agree with me if you watch the show, in fact, I believe that you would benefit from reading this then watching the show. Going into something with a lower expectation and getting something more. It is a good movie, just not masterpiece tier.",7,FeastnFamine

You have been warned. You can visit the summary (OVERALL) at the end to get the spoiler-less review.
Story: 6/10
Kimi No Nawa has a very interesting story. It pulls us in with the plot of a girl and boy switching bodies, basically doing activities in each others' lives, and later adds in a time-traveling ""mini-twist"" to this. It is presented in a very nice way, however, it does have logical flaws: what exactly caused the switch? Why do the characters suddenly get amnesia? These questions caused me to be confused, and partially ruin the story. Nevertheless, the fact that the girl-boy relationship is developed
                  well, in addition to a finally happy ending (remember, this guy usually doesn't have those), satisfy any fan of  Makoto Shinkai.
Art: 10/10
 Makoto Shinkai's art is always excellent. The animation is spot on, absolutely beautiful and astonishing. The trailer showcases the best moments, but even over 1 hour and 45 minutes, this art is consistent, and I have no complaints about it.
Sound: 10/10
The music was fitting and beautiful, each scene tinkling with great accompaniment. Not only so, the characters (more on this later) were quite realistic with good voices that stressed their personalities, especially after the boy and the girl switched bodies. I must applaud the director for excellently manipulating the voices to apply for their situation.
Character: 7/10
Despite the fact that the story, art, and sound are all excellent, the character is where Makoto falls short. He has very limited time to introduce any characters other than our main two, so we don't really know any other character. In addition, even these two characters are difficult to truly pin down. We get that Taki is hard-working, yet can't resist womanly charms ;) (if you know what I mean). We get that Mitsuha is very appealing and nice. Yet it doesn't get too much further than that. There are some moments here and there, but overall I feel like the two aren't too in-depth portrayed. This is sacrificed for the love story, which I feel is okay, but they spend too much time on their recovering from amnesia to really focus on a more human personality.
Enjoyment: 8/10
I really enjoyed this movie, and some scenes (especially the comet scene) practically moved me to tears. Still, I did mention that the time-travel scheme did confuse me, and the fact that it was never explained confused me and dwindled down my interest in the film.
_________________________________________________________
SUMMARY/OVERALL (no spoilers): 8/10
With excellent characters, motivating story, beautiful art, and a finally happy ending, Kimi No Nawa is no doubt a great anime, with the sole flaw being the crucial main plot devices never delved too deeply in detail, leaving some viewers with no doubt scratching their heads in confusion, but nevertheless enjoying the other parts of the movie.",8,9spaceking

                When I watch a movie, I watch it to enjoy not to write a comprehensive review. And because of that, it's hard to write much about this movie because of how forgettable it is. 
The MC is your typical regular dude. What impressive and smart character design... making the character relatable to the general audience in order to entrance the viewers. Except it's not exciting, it's boring, it's been boring the first day the trope existed and it's boring now. It's okay to make a character a little less colorful than the other characters for relatability, but you can't leave an empty slate for the
                  MC. 
The ""love"" aspect in this story is just a divine fated relationship, which is a shallow idea of romance in my opinion. What this story has going for it is the premise. It's a body swapping, time traveling blur. It's confusing but not interesting enough to bother to understand what's going on.
The time skip ending was so generic they may as well added a kiss under the fireworks scene as well. It felt as if they were clearly trying to appeal to everyone in the world and in order to do that they made the characters, emotion, and plot as bland as possible. This movie doesn't have traits that make it a bad, negative experience. It is just so bland to the point of painful mediocracy.",4,spongebob2012

                I can’t believe that I actually regret this. I actually regret scoring some anime I had watched a perfect 10. Because that would mean kimi no na wa would deserve at least an 11… I was intrigued by the fact that this new release shot up to MAL's top ranking in a mere span of several days. So I gave it a go and it left me speechless moments just after the end. If you too are curious, indulge your curiosity, you won’t regret it.
Story:
The story revolves around a teenage city boy and country girl switching bodies within their dreams. They dream of living each
                  other's lives and they physically do so, much to the comical dismay of each other. This might seem like a cliché plot to some but it didn’t bother me since the execution was fascinating to watch. I enjoyed their adolescent antics in each other's lives and the show left me with a pleasant heart-warming glow. I actually caught myself grinning pleasantly (unknowingly) countless times as the vibrant sense of youth was simply refreshing and cheerful, especially at times when their actions scream of adolescence, like when Taki begins to uh…explore his newfound form. Their struggle to adjust was amusing to watch and the playful banter between them that accompanied left a smile on my face. Of course the show was not without its downs, but even then the shock of the revelation was executed well enough to truly capture the viewer in the scenario. Basically, the story was depicted well enough to successfully tug on  the viewer’s heart strings in all the right directions at all the right times. 
Characters:
The characters Mitsuha and Taki were explored well enough for me to develop emotional attachments to them such that when disaster struck, I felt loss and when they were joyful, I could feel a warm smile spreading across my face. However, perhaps an issue that comes to mind would be the lack of screen time on their school lives (since as students, that’s where a good portion of their daily lives is spent) that could really solidify the attachments viewers have towards the characters such that when the emotional bomb goes off, it hits really, really hard. As far as I know, Taki seems like the typical boisterous teenager while Mitsuha comes across as a well mannered schoolgirl from an important family. The characters are simply not depicted as well as I'd like.
Animation and sound:
The soundtrack was astounding. The emotions that the music triggers are exactly the ones that you are supposed to experience at a particular scene or setting. The music provided the atmosphere and the viewing experience was simply beautiful. The heart warming moments were hence well expressed and I enjoyed every single moment listening to the background music. Even the abrupt stop of the pleasant soundtrack had its desired affect of sadness in one vital moment of the film. As for the animation, I am sure that it was breath-taking. Sadly, I didn’t get to see it. I had watched the show in low quality and even in the blurred screen I saw a plethora of colors, lens flare and amazing backgrounds with bright shades and hues that were beautiful and pleasing to the eye. It is definitely a major plus point of the show and I find it a pity that I didn’t get to enjoy the entire wholesome experience.
Enjoyment:
I truly enjoyed the film. It was certainly an emotional experience, that much is certain. Beautiful, heart-warming and emotional are words that come to mind while describing the show. I have never come across a film that could elicit so many pleasant feelings in such a short period of time. The only show that comes close is Usagi Drop with all its fluffy cuteness. If you enjoy an emotional rollercoaster, hop on, I think you found the best the anime world has to offer.
Overall:
This piece of art truly deserves the title of a masterpiece, no exaggeration at all. Kimi no na wa has left me wanting for more of Makoto Shinkai's work when previously, I wasn’t even aware of him. This anime currently takes the top spot on my favorites list and it is probably there to stay for quite a while as I am sure that kimi no na wa is the best that anime has to offer. You cannot doubt the fact that it has risen to MAL's top spot in a matter of days or that reviews are being written by users in tandem. I, myself, am writing this at 4 in the morning because I was afraid that I might lose my train of thoughts if I were to write a review at another time. Kimi no na wa is amazing and my words hardly do it justice. You are going to have to see for yourself. After all, hearing about what a rainbow looks like is a far cry from personally seeing its vibrant hues streak across the clear sky.",10,RyoKei-san

                I watched this not expecting that it would turn out the way it turned out to be. I only knew at the end that Makoto Shinkai was behind all this and realized that the style was similar to that of Byousoku 5 Centimeter. I really loved the art style and the setting. A focus on the countryside setting provided a refreshing scenery and the art piqued my interest and fondness for beautiful natural sceneries. The music came up at the right moment to tug at your heartstrings and take you in for a ride in a roller coaster of emotion. I really liked how the
                  story unfolded and that there was the concept of a distant love mixed in with it. It only enhanced the experience of watching this masterpiece. 
It can make you not only smile and happy, but also sad and frustrated. It was portrayed in a way that you would sympathize with the characters. This one breaks hearts and mends them, but never leaves them the same anymore. When you finish watching this, you'll feel like there's a gap, a hole, like something is now missing, and at the same time, satisfied. A perfect watch to make you feel alive!",10,eyaaan

                You know this movie has masterpiece level art. That is probably why many of you can't wait for this movie to come out in other countries. I just saw this in a Japanese movie theater yesterday. This was the 5th weekend that the movie has been out and the theater was still packed. I was lucky enough to see this movie on a giant screen with an impeccable sound system. Please do yourself a favor and watch this movie in the best-quality environment possible. 
The good: Long story short, Makoto Shinkai deserves a lot of praise. For me personally, the best part of this movie
                  was the moments in which he depicted what it feels like to be in Tokyo for the first time as a young person. There are other movies that show Tokyo's dark side, but the enthralling joy he portrayed in this movie is also a very real feeling. The way the four Radwimps songs, including the ending credit song, were incorporated was also masterpiece level. It felt like AMVs on steroids and did not take away from the flow of the movie in my opinion. It was a choice the director made and I loved it. 
The not as good: Just writing ""the plot"" seems like a cop-out but I don't want to write spoilers. I had a hard time finding an important message the director and creators wanted to convey. For me, themes are very important in a movie. I like having a theme that teaches me something about the world or new perspective. I had a harder time finding this on my own. I'll be scouring the internet to see what others noticed and I didn't. Also I enjoyed the first half of the movie more than the second half of the movie. However, the second half is still interesting and does provide a few ""that's cool"" moments. 
A thought: I'm thinking that an important theme for this movie has something to do with the word 産霊（むすび). The grandmother said this word and usually grandmothers are good mouthpieces for authors who want to convey some sort of  wisdom. My Japanese level is nowhere near the ability to understand this spiritual Japanese word about life, god(gods? God?), and threads.",8,Icanpostnow
32281,"
                As is expected of a Makoto Shinkai movie, Kimi no nawa was a masterpiece. A ""hybrid"" masterpiece I dare to say. It has a blend of Kotonoha no Niwa's visual prowess and 5 centimeters per seconds ability to create a melancholy atmosphere.
The soundtrack was amazing and the character development was solid. The only imperfection in the otherwise perfect movie was the storyline, a minute problem which I would attribute to the movie's length's inability to contain plot that would have portrayed a solid reason for the characters to bond as they did.
In the end, kimi no nawa is a movie I wouldn't mind recommending to
                  a friend or watching a couple of more times. 
All things put into consideration, the movie is a 10/10",10,bolubee

                Story:
Kimi no Na wa is the kind of film that gets an incredible amount of hype and you expect to be completely overrated and then it isn't at all. On the contrary, at a basic level it is merely a love story. However, what makes this story really special is the way that is presented to the viewer in such a way that you are never sure quite what is happening - even after the film has ended. It has been two days and I am still making realizations about this film and tightness in my chest still remains as I contemplate what I was
                  able to learn from the characters and the presentation of the story itself - symbolically or otherwise.
Art:
As to be expected of Makoto Shinkai, the animation in this film is stunning. For anyone that cannot see it on a big screen it is really a shame. The animation style is reminiscent of Kotoha no Niwa and his other works. Those that are a fan of his previous works will absolutely not be disappointed. The way that the night sky colours are blended to contrast with their surroundings is beautifully done. As well, as in Kotoha no Niwa, the rain could be real.
Sound:
Some may say that having one band produce the whole soundtrack for the film will leave the sound lacking originality or adequate sound expression. However, I do not think that Kimi no Na wa could have been provided with a more perfect soundtrack. As I write this review I am listening to the album and I am brought fully back into the film. These songs are able to successfully invoke the feelings from the film without visual or vocal contents. The three to four songs that are written with lyrics fit into the narrative of the story just as well. The combination of the animation and the sound makes for a very well-balanced film.
Characters:
I give characters a lower score than the others not because they were bad, but because they were not particularly unique. What made them really special was their presentation within the film and how the two main characters contrast and compare to each other. The background characters also have important roles in the film that make progression impossible without them. None the less, I feel that the characters, while very well suited to the movie and not diminishing the quality in the slightest, do lack some originality.
Enjoyment:
I don't think it is necessary to explain again how much I enjoyed this film and how much it is still affecting me days later. Ideas and concepts from the film have been finding their way into my thoughts and dreams for many days. I have a deep appreciation for this film and the message that I think it was trying to present to the viewers. While I didn't cry, I am not often this internally thrown off by such a film.
Overall I think that this film was absolutely amazing. It leaves me feeling extremely satisfied at the same time that it leaves me feeling hollow and incomplete. The soundtrack pulls my heartstrings and constantly replays through my mind, just as if I am still watching the movie. As I think of the animation and look at pictures online, my heart swells at the beauty of what I am seeing before me. I think that this film deserves all praise that it has received and will see in the future. It is currently the third most popular animated film to ever be released in Japan and I think that it fully deserves that spot. When the film is released on DVD with subtitles or on streaming websites, I highly recommend it to anyone. I think that this film gives something to people of any age and that is has something really special. I look forward to more of Makoto Shinkai's work in the future.",10,mollymay5000

                ---Spoiler Free Review---
The director of this movie doesn’t know how to write a decent story, the end! Original Story, Script editing bla bla he should focus his work only on Aesthetics and let someone else write a decent plot for the future. If this guy base future works in previous WELL written books I can tell is gonna be a good movie otherwise I don’t want to see anything from him anymore. I don’t get the hype about this movie, some people compare him even to Hayao Miyazaki, how on earth THEY DARE to do that!!! 
Story (2/10): it start somehow very normal, cute and
                  entertaining with the amazing visuals however in the moment the story advanced everything went to hell, so many inconsistency in the plot, so many things explain so bad that in order not to make spoiler I can’t write it here, but they were so lame, didn’t make any sense, the drama feel so force, if you think twice the characters didn’t even have reasons to fall in love, in summary BAD. 
Characters (4/10): basic, nothing to admire, typical teens. 
Art (10/10): beautiful, if the rate was only based on this then the movie is a solid 10, however the definition of a movie is an audiovisual medium to tell a story, is so sad this movie lack of a good one. 
Sound 9/10: nothing from other world, not bad neither amazing. 
Enjoyment (5/10): like the visuals, cringes every time something about the story is explain. Btw one of the “supposed plot twist” was so predictable that I laugh. 
Overall 5/10: if it wasn’t for the visual of this movie then I probably drop it and then scored it even lower like a 2 or 3.",5,Aoi_no_sora

                When anime is overtly trying to be realistic and cinematic, the lines between cinema and anime are further blurred. This might be a good thing for the wider reception of anime in cinemas (especially outside Japan) but not necessarily a good thing because 'anime' starts to take the medium itself too seriously. 
Each scene is 'crafted' to look great in the isolated frame and it does demonstrate the animation technologies of Makoto Shinkai's anime movies - from  Byōsoku Go Senchimētoru to Kotonoha no Niwa. This is not to blame Makoto Shinkai and his amazing achievement as an animator, editor and cinematographer, but not as
                  a storyteller. Cliches are not necessarily a problem when you have excellent storytelling skills but your name is definitely not one of them.",6,telerabies

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
Kimi no na wa. is the highest rated movie on MAL with a score of 9.13. A lot of people were amazed by this movie, but I have a lot of reasons which made me hate this movie.
Reason no. 1:Plotholes
The movie is about two people swapping bodies, but they do not live in the same moment. They are born the same year, but Mitsuha is 3 years older. When they swap bodies they leave each other notes on their phones. THEY WERE CONSTANTLY ON THEIR PHONES AND THEY NEVER CHECKED THE DATE.
Another plothole is the fact that the bodyswap was never explained
                  and Shinkai never told us what was the cause of the bodyswap!
Reason no. 2:Melodrama
The movie is forcing emotions on the audience way too much. Every scene which is supposed to be emotional is succeeded by a song. This was annoying because it was interrupting the movie constantly! 
Reason no.3:Pace
The first 50 minutes of the movie is about their experiences in other person's body! That is almost half of the entire film! Next 40 minutes are about Taki searching for Mitsuha and trying to save her life. They meet near the end and get separated very quickly out of an unknown reason.
A lot of people probably liked this movie because it blends romance, teenagers and time travel together. This movie is perfect for any Otaku.
I recommend the movie to you if you like to shut your brain off and accept every single fact thrown at you during the movie and just enjoy the beautiful visuals.

                ----Characters----
For the most part, our supernatural force carries our characters through the plot, rather than vice versa. In that sense, there wasn't really much of a purpose for them to fulfill other than to fall in love and be the people we root for. They don't develop in a way worth mentioning, and I can think of maybe only a few distinct traits that distinguish them from other characters, but that doesn't necessarily detract from what the movie was trying to accomplish.
In other words, they offer no merit to the story, but I don't consider them to be complete deadweight.
----Art & Sound----
Great, and good, respectively!
                  They’re rightfully the pieces of this movie that get praised the most, and in many cases are what carry the weight of its quality. Not much I’ll say here will be something that hasn’t already been said, so I’ll let you take my and a plethora of other reviews’ word for it.
----Story & Enjoyment----
To echo what many other reviews around the same scoring as mine articulate, the first half of the movie can be pretty enjoyable, if that more light-hearted, comical, ""Oh my, I have boobs now!"" body-switching fiasco is your cup of tea. Sometimes, we like to sit down and watch something that has a silly little twist that leads to some even sillier mishaps, and combined with our pretty pictures that Shinkai gifted us, it's pretty darn fun! No harm, no foul.
What Kimi No Na Wa asked of us here was to sit back, giggle, and watch all of the silliness unfold. And I did, and it was enjoyable, and all in good fun.
What Kimi No Na Wa later asks of us is to engage with how the story progresses in a more meaningful way by attempting to piece together the little supernatural easter egg hints it begins to leave behind. In other words, our plot was pretty cute and silly for a little while, but it shifts to a more serious tone and throws a few mysteries and questions about the body-switching your way (mostly via our lovely elderly side character, who I will touch upon in nary a second). This happens as we get into the nitty gritty of what will ultimately turn out to be, like, three separate climaxes (but I digress).
Is there something wrong with that change of pace? No, but there's many things wrong with the meat of the story -- our mysterious supernatural body-switching force -- once you begin engaging with it in any way that involves a thought process. (That's it. Just any thought process). We have all these exciting twists and turns and half-explanations, and they are, indeed, exciting. But as exciting as they are, this doesn't excuse them from being nonsensical, as the entire thesis of the movie seems to revolve around the theme underlying our supernatural body-switching force that ultimately leaves us with more plot holes than anything else.
Can we forgive those plot holes for the sake of the meaning and purpose of our story? I'd love to, but they’re a part of what essentially made over an hour's worth of our tension, conflict, and, wow, let me say this again, 3+ climaxes. Because of the nature of the mysteriousness and gradual tension, we’re engaged to think about how and why these supernatural things are occurring. And if you do that, even just for a little, you’ll realize that the solutions the story offers make little to no sense. (I’d give examples, but we’re attempting to keep this thing spoiler-free, ladies. If you simply browse a bit more, I’m sure you’ll find a spoiler-full review that happily lists those plot inconsistencies).
The last thing I feel obliged to touch on is what seems to be consistently praised about this movie, which is its use of symbolism, AKA what it uses dominantly to assert its central message. To those who rate this movie less than a 7, it seems like a given response will be a fan purporting that said reviewer must not have picked up on the subtle, nuanced symbolism Shinkai has presented, that we just missed the entire point of the movie. Before you comment such a thing, I just gotta say: no, I didn’t.
I find this to be a little silly, given that it’s a bit difficult to miss out on the running theme of the movie when it was given not only its own supporting character to just straight-up verbalize the entire meaning alongside, “This is profound,” but that we also get a glimpse of aforementioned symbolism every couple of scenes, almost as if to ensure that we did, in fact, catch on. 
----Concluding Thoughts----
I certainly wouldn’t watch it again, and it’s definitely not a masterpiece. But no discredit to you if you simply enjoy the movie, or want to see what the hype is about. It’s fun enough at times, and it’s certainly, of course, really pretty. If you’re just looking for something to watch for the sake of watching or killing time, it’s not the worst choice so long as you’re able to forgive gaping plot holes.

                Very minor spoilers.
So there is a lot of criticism revolving around this movie, mostly due to its blatant plot holes and issues with the character relationship. And yes, I did notice these when I first watched it.
Now, lets take a step back.
What is anime? Its a form of media that is meant to entertain, something that should bring joy to the viewers. That is what most media should do, whether they be music, movies, or television shows.
And Kimi no Na Wa definitely succeeds in that regards.
Yes, some of the plot devices contradicted itself. Yes, the relationship between the character is weakly supported. Yes, a lot
                  of the time switching is illogical. In fact, I give story a 6 and character a 7. But none of this takes away the enjoyment of the movie. The enjoyment of this movie comes from one thing: execution. Each and every part of the movie is incredibly well directed and the soundtrack is precisely timed to complement each scene. At times, I guarantee that you will find yourself holding your breath during the movie's major plot reveals and events through amazing animation. You will be rooting for the characters as the director dangles the conclusions of relationships in front of you. The music will absolutely blow you away. At least, that is if you watch anime as it was meant to be watched.
I've read a lot of the reviews on MAL, and they reminded me of my high school AP English teacher. He would pick on the grittiest things, such as MLA formatting and how to use a quotation. He would not even acknowledge some of the interesting insights and opinions that I had written because he was so engrossed in criticizing it. And I understand for all you English majors out there that for English, formatting and quoting are important because it is a form of study and analysis.
Anime is not AP English. It is a form of media that is meant to be fun, and in my opinion enjoyability is the most important factor over plot and character. Sure, plot and character are important aspects of enjoyability, especially if it is so bad as to the point of hinderance. But Kimi no Na Wa is not hindered by plot holes and character faults, and the music and animation make up for those issues.
A ""perfect anime"" does not exist, and that can be shown by the fact that no show has gotten a rating of 10 by all users. All movies and shows will have faults, as directors are humans too and are bound to make mistakes. Some will make more mistakes than others, but those mistakes may be overlooked by the better aspect of the presentation. Rubbing in the faults just because they exist may be some people's cup of tea, but in my opinion, it is their loss because they won't be able to enjoy much out of the movie/show as a whole. For me, Kimi no Na Wa is indeed the ""perfect anime"" just because of how enjoyable it is. Not because it is perfect.",10,nomadicGob

This is basically not a coherent and total lengthy review and I just wanna tell that I rewatched this today (October 4, 2021). This is a total masterpiece on its own actually, in fact, this is the reason why I started watching animes.

                I decided to write my first review on this movie, merely because, until now, in my opinion, this is the best anime film i've ever seen.
I don't want to write about the story, because i think this movie has to be discovered in its entirety, from the first second to the last moment.
I would prefer to write what this amazing work left to me: Happiness and some laughs in the first part, astonished in the second part, while in the last about 20 minutes.... well, a mixture ofwell - known feelings such as: rage, sadness, melancholy, hopeful... and so on. This movie managed to make
                  me cry for the first time, but i don't know really why: i watched/read/played many sad scenes, but this... this... well, this masterpiece has something unique in itself, even if i think sound and characters are ""only"" excellent, but not perfect. Maybe the wise mix of supernatural and ordinary elements, maybe  the location, that is divided in two parts: a small village between a lake and the mountains on the one hand, and Tokyo on the other, maybe my psichological condition in this particular moment... I could tell you much more about the story, the characters and many other things, but this movie has to be watched without knowing any about it and, in particular, with your heart, after with your mind, and only in the end with your eyes, just to enjoy the extraordinary artistic quality of this work.

                Alright its my first time writing a review but this movie truly deserves many praises
Where do i start ; I enjoyed every single bit of it
Story ; A fairly unique story line.Although i myself found it confusing at some parts but when the parts of the story come together, it really is a masterpiece
Art and Sound ; Incredible,stunning,amazing art and sound. Comix really did an incredible job in producing the art and sound
Character ; The characters although not having thorough screen time other than the two main characters did portray personalities that i myself was able to relate to in real life. Taki and
                  Mitsuha, the two main characters were actually the closest i was to able to relate myself to.
Overall : I had a blast watching it . The movie shows the thread of fate between the two main characters. Some parts of the moive seem 3d but it was needed. A lot throughout the movie, I found myself compelled with mixed emotions.This movie incited my body with emotions of which i didnt know existed in me.
In the end , the story depicts the beauty of fate and how much memories make up who we are now and in the future",10,Ja33er318

                Hi. Let me preface this by stating that the last time I wrote anything remotely seriously that wasn't math was in high school. As such, this is my first movie review, so I apologize for any mistakes.
I had the pleasure of watching Kimi no Na Wa. yesterday and all I've gotta say is that I was bawling by the end of the movie.
Story: 10
Art : 10
Sound: 10
Character: 10
Enjoyment: 9
Overall: 10
Coming into the film, I'd watched a bunch of other Makoto Shinkai titles. Based on that, and some word of mouth, the themes of the movie were more or less what I'd expected. However - just because I sort of knew what to expect from the movie doesn't detract from the overall experience that is the masterpiece Kimi no Na Wa.
Story
The story flowed in a very intuitive way and had great depth - particularly, it did a very good job of introducing and highlighting each main characters' personality traits. By 40 minutes in, I could really tell what each character was good at, their little quirks, their hopes, dreams, aspirations. Then, the transition between the first part of the movie was masterfully handled - it all flowed together very well. Towards the end, you only begin to fully realize how much you care for the main characters - and I could tell that the theatre did too.
Art 
It's a Makoto Shinkai film. I don't think it needs to be said. The art, in my opinion, surpassed that of 5 wallpapers per second.
Sound 
This was my first time hearing RADWIMPS perform, and I definitely look forward to more from them. The OST beautifully melded with each scene in the film, and RADWIMPS' sparkle gave me chills in the scene where it was played.
Character 
Considering that this is a film with a limited time constraint, I feel that the characters were fleshed out pretty well. As I said before, you could really tell  by 40 minutes in who the MCs really were. Even the supporting cast, particularly Saya and Tessie, the reveal in the middle of the movie really stung quite a bit. The audience was audibly affected, too. The voice actors, Mitsuha and Taki's particularly, were on POINT.
Enjoyment 
The sole reason I give this a 9/10 is because I'm just really biased and wanted more from the ending. I was immersed in the film from the beginning and honestly this should be a 10/10 but I'm just stubborn and greedy and really want more.
Final thoughts
I haven't seen a lot of anime films, but among them, this film is my clear favourite. It's Shinkai's most accessible, so to speak, work so far. I enjoyed it from start to end, felt an emotional connection with the characters, and I definitely think that this film should be considered one of the best of all time, up there with Akira, Spirited Away, etc. I expect this film to be a hit with the western audience once it premieres.",10,THE_CARRY

                This movie has a rather unique story, but that alone does not make a good movie. The combination of the beautiful visuals and music coupled with the engaging story is what makes this a masterpiece. 
Story
The story is told in the point of view of the 2 main characters. It fits together nicely in a continuous story and leaves no room for confusion about what is happening at what time. Whilst the plot is simple at first, more questions are raised as you continue. It keeps you engaged in the story without being too boring or confusing. Whilst the story may seem predictable at first,
                  it was this preconception that initially drew me into this movie and compelled me to carry on watching.
The story was well paced; Nothing felt dragged out to too rushed. Each element of the story was meticulously done. The romance especially was unique and must be given credit as I felt that it was hard to pull off. This is due to the fact that it must be done in a way the characters do not encounter each other but shows the development of the relationship between them. The supernatural genre and element of mystery was captivating, coupled by beautiful visuals and appropriate music, leaving viewers in a relative suspense.
After finishing this movie, there may be questions the viewers raised and have not been answered. These are however, most likely not crucial to the storyline. There are always things unanswered and this is something that most anime with the supernatural genre share. By no means does this mean that the ending was unsatisfying. In my opinion, it could not have been done any better than it already has.  
Art
The art is very beautiful with the animation style and quality being consistent throughout. Different moods are brought about with different colours and lighting eg. bright colours creating a peaceful and harmonic atmosphere. The characters are well drawn and fluidly animated whilst the landscapes are so detailed it is seemingly brought to life. In my opinion it cannot be criticised.  
Sound
The background music is crucial in helping create the atmosphere within this movie, coupled with the visuals. They enhance the mood of the scene and really drives home the feeling and atmosphere the author had wanted to portray. The voice actors have also done a marvellous job in bringing the characters to life. They completely captured the feelings the characters wanted to portray with their amazing voice acting. 
Character
The development of the characters well done. As the 2 main characters ‘interact’ with each other, they begin to change each other. It is enjoyable to see this change, especially the growth of the characters. The side cast are not developed any more than necessary as to not lose focus of the main characters. However, this does not mean the side cast lacked any depth. They were able to fulfil their roles in this movie whilst keeping our focus on the main characters.  
Enjoyment
I absolutely enjoyed every moment, every second of this remarkable movie. In my opinion, it is a masterpiece. I believe that everyone, even non-anime fans would enjoy this movie as it is meticulously done in every aspect with an engaging story. I could see myself re-watching this movie many times in the future and the enjoyment of watching it would not be inferior to the first time you watch it in any way. 
Overall, it was a very memorable movie. I could see myself losing sleep, thinking of how wonderful this movie was. I can say with confidence that you will not regret watching it.",10,Shuc49

                Kimi No Na. Wa (Eng: Your Name), a masterpiece by Makoto Shinkai. He is a person who is well thought of as the new Miyazaki, and this movie piece proves that very well.
I have watched this show on its release in Kissanime, and it did not disappoint all the hype I had for this movie.
Now, let's go into the review.
Story: 9/10
This story definitely has it's querks, but it is really amazing. After reading the plot summary and watching the preview multiple times, it really came out different from what I had originally thought would be the storyline. This sort of storyline is also not what
                  a normal storywriter would think of, and it really mesmerized me how a story could happen.
Art: 9/10
As an art student, I can definitely differentiate the art style from this and many of other anime works. This one definitely came out on top, as the art, directed by a person who did Spirited Away, really came out huge. I thought that it was comparable to the art of 'Kotonoha no Niwa', another production by Shinkai. This just proves that Shinkai's films generally have amazing art.
Sound: 10/10
The sound that was used in this anime was extremely appropriate. The theme song for this anime, as well as the end song, was made by RADWIMPS, who Shinkai said was a band he liked. The sound here was really well done, and I also liked the theme song, as it was really appropriate for the preview of the movie, and and the music in the anime itself really compliments the mood of a specific scene.
Character: 8/10
The character part of the anime is not the greatest though, because it really solely focuses on Mitsuha and Taki. I would definitely like more in-depth into the other characters of the movie, as it would make it a whole lot better in my opinion. I dont really mind if it is 5 minutes longer. Just give more character development to the other characters. Although I would say, focusing on these 2 characters are very appropriate for a movie such as this, I think focusing more on the other characters would make it a lot better.
Enjoyment: 10/10 
I really enjoyed Kimi No Na Wa. The elements of the movie itself really compliments itself and is masterfully done. Nothing less expected of Shinkai, really. I am really impressed.",10,Hieq

                Kimi no na wa is a drama, romance, school and supernatural movie. The movie is original Japanese but you can see it in English, but I think it sounds weird in English. Kimi no na wa was made in may 2016.
Kimi no na wa is a fantastic movie, because it´s so sad and yet funny at the same time. I actually started crying while watching this movie, because something happened that you didn’t expect at all.   
The characters are very different from each other they are literally opposites, but I still think they are a great couple. 
The reason why they are such
                  a great couple, is because one of the main characters travels across the country to find a person he hasn’t met before.
About halfway through the movie he tries to find a place that keeps popping up in his head, and when he finally finds the place, he finds out that it has a very special meaning to him. I actual don’t know what he did, but it´s like he travels to an alternative universe.
The end of the movie is just beautiful and the graphics are fantastic, but of course there is a plot twist, the main charterers meet but it´s not a happy ending...",10,63883

I liked it so much because it makes me appreciate the story so much!
I myself havent watched a lot of anime but this anime movie deserves a 10
The movie really makes me emotional and sit on the edge of my chair
I hated the cliffhanger doe, i would like that cliffhanger made into a anime, a anime that is a continuation of this Gorgeous movie!
The work behind this movie must
                  have takes ages and its a perfect family movie to watch with the family!

                This is a fine popcorn movie, but not the masterpiece everyone claims it to be. When's the last time you called a movie with underwhelming characters and underwhelming plot a ""masterpiece?"" You wouldn't. But there's a reason why this movie tricks the audience into being dazzled and distracted by its visuals and emotional punch.
That term is what I call ""feelsbaiting.""
This movie uses cheap narrative and visual tricks to bait you into an emotional response without offering any actual substance to warrant it. The characters are paper-thin, and for the most part we don't have any valid reasons to root for them. Other than vicarious catharsis
                  I suppose. The movie never gives you a good reason to hope the two characters get together. 
On a side note, the comet prominently featured in the story makes no sense. I understand the story is already supernatural, but the story was clearly written by someone who doesn't understand how comets work. The story depends so much on the comet doing stuff that simply isn't plausible. And before you say ""but supernatural!"", the movie never establishes the comet to be supernatural in any way. 
Anyway, you're probably going to watch the movie regardless but I just want to set the record straight and hopefully protect people from falling for feelsbaiting. Feelsbait does *not* make for a good story and cannot serve as a substitute for good storytelling.",7,Crusader_8

                This is the first anime movie i watch and i got a great experience with it. They combine supranatural and romance genre in here. I think they are pretty good combining it, like i can feel the high school romance thing while being confused by the magic.
Story 10/10
This movie here is making me cry. I'm crying because they make us ride the rollercoaster of emotion, at the first half of this movie it just a typical high school comedy anime but after that it take us up and down with the happiness and sadness. There are a lot of plot twist that i didn't expect
                  at all, they doing a great job hiding it. I can't explain with words how amazing the story is, but one thing for sure is that this movie is my favourite anime movie of all time.
Art 10/10
The art here is so gorgeous. All scenery in this movie like the forest, mountain, village, city, its all great you can take a screenshot of it and make it your desktop wallpaper. Little detail in the background is also what make the art perfect. Don't forget the character desain, they all drawn so pretty. Also the camera angle and the character movement are really smooth.
Sound 10/10
This is my favourite part of the movie. All the music here is so good. Especially the infamous Sparkle by Radwimps, it really bring the atmsohphere that the movie had and now this song goes to my anime music playlist. If we talk about the BGM i don't pay to much attention to it, i don't know why maybe its because i'm too focusing on the story. The one that i remember is from the end, it is because the story has ended and i can listen to it in relax situation. Also the SFX is so natural and realistic, there are no weird sound or something off.
Character 10/10
Even though the main character here is just a normal high school student and nothing special, i still like them. Why, because they are so relatable. Actually they are not that bland, i can tell when they are swaping body even when the movie didn't tell me. The side character here are also great and they play the role perfectly. They doing a great job making the side character have a personality, despite this is a movie where you have barely enough time for it.
Enjoyment 10/10
This is the first anime movie i've ever watched and it bring a great expectation to me. When someone mention anime movie this is the first thing that crossed my mind, the movie is just so iconic. Thanks to this now i can dive into anime movie, at first i'm scared that this won't meet my expectation because movie is shorter than anime and it will lack of story or character. But no, it is higher than my expectation and now i can safely say that anime movie is also great. 
If you haven't watch this movie yet, go watch it. I can't guarantee that you will like it or anything, but you will get a good experience with it. Even my brother that isn't into anime really like this movie when i encourage him to watch it. This movie is a masterpiece and no one can change my mind.

                [Spoiler included since I cannot explain and counter those so-called bad points other reviews mentioned without putting any spoilers in]
Hello guys, this is my first review since after seeing so many bad reviews about this anime, I feel that I have the obligation to tell the owners of those reviews the bad points they said are actually already explained thoroughly in the anime, just that they did not pay attention and then blame the anime for it.  I already watched 5cm/s or Kotonoha no Niwa, and those two did not leave any emotion on me compared to Kimi no Na wa. In my opinion,
                  this is the best work so far of Shinkai Makoto.
I went to the cinema in Japan to see it without any subtitles and in HD definition, so maybe the impact the anime did on me is much more larger than what it did to people who watch it in low definition and with subtitles, but I will try to write an unbiased review as much as I can. 
Art & Sound: 10/10
I guess there is nothing more to say about the art in Shinkai Makoto's works. However, why I put Art and Sound together? Because this is the most important point of the anime that make the greatest impact on the audience. Shinkai Makoto takes us to the magnificent scenery of Japanese rural area, and he knows how to arrange the music so that it blends so well into the anime. I am not talking about the BGM because honestly the BGM did not make any outstanding effect. I am talking about the insert songs they put together into the scenes. Even the lyrics fit well into the mood, for example, the scene when our protagonist - Taki - searches for our main heroine - Mitsuha - the song [Nan de mo iya ] is played, with the repeating lines of [Ato sukoshi dake de ii], literally means only for a little more is okay. This repeatitive line together with the flow of the anime leaves great impact on the audience. Moreover, the band performed this song also did it so well that we can even feel the emotion throughout each of the line in the song being sang out. 
Story: 9/10
I believe this section is arguably the most downside of the anime that other reviews mentioned. The story itself is good with proper plot. I would say it is somehow typical and not typical. The body-changing genre is not so unfamiliar to the anime world, but the thing that feels original is that there is no ecchi included, as well as both two of them are strangers and live far away from each other. Needless to say the time-twist also make a great point in the anime. At this point, many of our reviewers said that the movie did not explain anything about the time-travel, as well as their body-swapping occurrence, and they rated the anime bad because of this so-called convenience plot hole. Firstly, let me explain about the occurrence of the body-swapping. The movie did gives an unofficial reason about this situation, when Taki got swapped into Mitsuha for the last time, just before the night of the disaster. Mitsuha's grandma did say that the body-swapping occurred to her before as well in her youth days, so it can be understand that this occurs to the Miyamizu household in periodically. You may ask why? Taki did mention that maybe this body-swapping tradition from long ago's reason is for this day, for him to save the Miyamizu household from the destruction by the fall of the comet.  Moreover, let me remind you that the Miyamizu house is an old household with a tradition of being Miko and offer worship to the Gods. They even have their own shrine, and the inhabitants in the city also worship them. This can be explain as the Gods want to save their longtime worshipers, so that they make this miracle. To the next so-called bad points is that the time travel when Taki meets Mitsuha on top of the mountain. Please remember that during the first half of the anime. a scene with Mitsuha in class did mention about twilight. This is the time of the day that superficial things can happened, and that time-travel maybe also included. Moreover, I will not called that a time travel. It is more like the current Taki meets the past Mitsuha (or the current Mitsuha in her own time frame) since they have that small thread of hair tie bounding them together, and thus make this possible. Lastly. this is not a realistic-based anime or psychological reality anime, so these little miracles are acceptable as long as the anime has the means to explain it. 
On the other hand, the plot also has it downside. There is a little rush at the middle of the movie, when our two main characters accept their body-changing situation pretty fast (given the fact that it is only around 1 week or more after they started experiencing the paranormal situation). Furthermore, it might be argued that why the body-swapping did not occur when the disaster happens, but 3 years later into the future. The anime did not say anything about this, but I think each of us can have our own explanation for this since this is not much of a big deal. 
Character: 8/10
The characters in Kimi no na wa is a little above average in my opinion. The movie did flesh out their personalities, as well as a couple of development, but I feel like that this is not enough. However, given the time of a movie, not a series, this is in an acceptable zone. On the other hand, I feel like the feeling called [Like] between our two main characters is a bit rush, since they barely knows others from the notes they left when body-swapping, and Taki as well as Mitsuha are pretty bold to go and search for a person that they did not even met for once. Nevertheless, given the fact of our current society, where a highschool boys fall in love with a girl in only a few days after they met, I believe this point is not that much of a ruckus as everybody has said. People at that age tends to do many great things that they believe is right without listen to others, so I guess this is not that much of a downside.
Enjoyment: 10/10
I gave this anime a 10 in enjoyment because of the lingering feelings it left behind. This anime has a good ending, but all of the past scenes, together with the music arrangement will make you feel regret about something in life, or feeling that there is something incomplete, and this emotion keeps lingering inside your mind even after the anime is finished. It has been a long time since I felt such emotion, maybe the last time was when I watched Kaguya-hime no Monogatari. 
Overall: 10/10
There is nothing perfect in this world, so as anime. A perfect anime does not exist, so I want to give this a 9.5 rating, but the scoring bar does not have that function. I gave it 10 for the enjoyment it brings to me, for the lingering emotion that I have not felt after such a long time, as well as the feeling of reliving your high school days in a beautiful scenery, which reminds us about our youth, the age when we think that everything is possible, the age when our mind is still pure. I personally enjoy this anime a lot, and I intend to watch it again when the bluray comes out. In my opinion, this is the best work so far of Shinkai Makoto, above that of 5cm/s and Kotonoha no Niwa,  which I do not really like watching.

Well what can I say about Kimi no Na wa. First off you go into this movie expecting something decent, given it's a Makoto Shinkai creation. But what I was given in this movie was something unbelievable. This story had everything going good for it, even the cliche tropes were used very well. When I first heard of this movies inception I knew right away I would enjoy it, I was not expecting how much I would enjoy this film. (SLIGHT SPOILER HERE SKIP IF YOU DON'T WANT A TINY PLOT POINT RUINED)
I really... really did love the Lake House vibe this story gave us. It didn't seem corny at all even. Mitsuha and Taki formed such an adorable relationship through their ""dreams"" it almost, no scratch that, it did make me cry. Several times. At least in the end they end up meeting.
(SPOILER HAS ENDED)
This story had such heartwarming moments, really tearful and joyful. It really touches your heart, you connect with Taki and Mitsuha. The character development those two share is great, you get enough early. You keep getting everything you need late, well thought out when delivering it to us. Not to mention the designs are down. They are simple. They are elegant. They are art. I thoroughly enjoyed the great music used in this movie, fits so so well. 
I want to close by mentioning the Art and Animation style itself.

                This movie is an anime masterpiece.
The Story (10/10) is ridiculously sick. Just so interesting and well developed.
The Art (9/10) and Sound (9/10) just amplify the whole feel of the movie and the music is so good and comes in at all the most perfect times...plus all the songs are by RADWIMPS, so you really can't go wrong there.
The Characters (7/10) are slightly underdeveloped but I think is probably necessary to keep the story flowing at a good pace.

                  watched it once so far and it was really really enjoyable watching it for the first time, but I'm not too sure about its rewatch value because of the nature of the story...but who knows might still be quite high since the movie is such a good watch.",10,astrofiger

                Spoiler free! I tend to watch anime while I work out and this one had me on tears (repeatedly) in a full gym, maybe once falling off the elliptical. 
The tone starts out very light. Halfway through the movie I felt it could have ended. And then it gets deeper as we delve into the history of the characters and perhaps things we (as the audience) didn't notice along the way. 
The artwork is gorgeous, comparable to Death Parade and Garden of Words. The colors are very saturated as the characters experience bright, different, new lives in which every day is a colorful experience. The
                  characters are equally well animated, occasionally obviously rotoscoped, but still beautifully portrayed. 
The soundtrack really pulls at your mood and helps set up events in dramatic, sweeping fashion. The voice actors are very believable in their roles. 
The characters pull you in to their lives and you find yourself rooting for them and wishing to find out the outcome throughout the entire movie. Each character is unique and contributes to the movie, even the side characters there to simply react to the mains or lead them along. What I enjoy the most in a story is when something is introduced in the beginning (such as a hobby of a character) that plays a large part later on, which is something we see in this movie several times over.

                A comet, not a meteor nor an asteroid crashing into Earth. Imagine a situation like that. According to modern science, that is way too unlikely to ever happen. Until Shoemaker-Levy 9 crashed into Jupiter and was smashed into pieces. But what about if it happens to our planet? The results will be surely too catastrophic to even consider. I'll ask again. How about if it happens anyway? Will you die? Now what kind of question is that?
Kimi no Na ha, or also known as Your Name, is an anime movie that sparked a legendary record in terms of gross sales and popularity in Japan. Why?
                  Is it so good? It is good that watching it will really be worth your time? Or something crappy? Are scenes ""that"" well-executed?
I watched this anime from a recommendation from a classmate. I was kind of skeptical about watching it first because it seems to kind of like Kokoro Connect, which I've never even have watched before (I was also skeptical. Until now, I still haven't watched it). But after 3 months of doubting, I finally gave in to my curiosity and watched it fully in a car back home when we were in a journey far away. Guess what I found? Masterpiece.
The story centers around a female teenager named Mitsuha. She seems to live in a traditional Japanese town Itomori. It also centers on a male teenager named Taki who lives in Tokyo and is a working student. Then a mysterious incident involving the two happened between them. They were unexpectedly switching bodies against their will along with their personalities. As a result, many complications happened and as they worked together to overcome it. A unique way to create a plot.
The story was purely outstanding! There were lots of events concerning themselves with many issues that must be solved, which were truly well-executed and well-articulated that from its very exposition to the climax to the denouement, you couldn't even bear to take your eyes off of watching the movie even for a femtosecond! I am not joking. It is too good to be true. Check the ratings for the evidence.
The art was truly satisfying. The designs created, the animations utilized in the themes and the movie itself, and even the comet falling was truly excellent. The scenes in which they were switching bodies and the creation of kuchikamisake was so stunning, I couldn't get over it. The character designs was also something great. They were so good, that I cannot say anything more about this matter.
I was kind of rushing in writing my review so that I can now write what I think about the sounds, OSTs and music within the movie. The OSTs were so great it blended well and was used to its greatest potential in the movie. The songs by RADWIMPS was the one that most highlighted the musical themes in the movie. It was so excellent, beautiful, pulchritudinous and other more synonyms that I CAN'T GET OVER IT!
""Aa kono mama bokutachi no koe ga sekai no hashikku made kieru koto naku, todoitara shitara ii no ni na""
""Yatto me wo samashi takai, sore na no ni naze me mo awase ya shinai ndai?""
And other lots more that truly enlightened the movie. Kudos to the Japanese anime music industry! Banzai!
The characters were also to die for. Their personalities, voice actors/actresses and overall individuality were so great and they gradually develop as the story progresses. Each of them was unique. I also want to note the times when they were swapping, and because of that, their constant misunderstanding. Those scenes were truly excellent and makes want to know more. Also that scene when some drinks something under something. If you’ve watched it, you’ll know.
Enjoyment. I truly enjoyed the movie, and that goes without saying. Lots pf scenes where you can really relate to, lots of scenes to be loved. To be honest, I gained some mixed emotions watching this. Sadness, happiness, a little bit of anger and, well, enjoyment. Truly satisfactory.
Overall, I get why this anime rocketed over the top of Japanese anime media. It has excellent music, (yes, music, that’s what I think made the anime go crazy popular in my bias) excellent story, excellent art, excellent characters and pure excellence within. If you’ve never even have watched it, then watch it! You wouldn’t be sorry. It is truly good.

Story (7/10) Good
More Specifically (7.75/10) Good+
(Semi-Spoilers)
Now I see a nice handful of people that thought the story was complete trash. But I personally don't think so, did it start off generic? yeah I felt so, but I don't think that's a bad thing. But I personally can't fully compliment something I've seen too many of times, now the execution behind said generic story plot is the best I've seen so far I'll give it that but them it fell apart soon after. And by generic story plot I've seen too many times I'm talking about the body-switch
                  story plot. I've personally seen this too many times and when I figured out during the movie that this is where the plot was going you can basically predict everything that's going to happen and then there's the half way point which is suppose to be the biggest plot twist for the movie. This is the part of the movie that's suppose to hook you and you know what I'm talking about. Now I did get far more interested than I did before that scene happened as I should, some people where completely turned off by I but I wasn't. That plot twist happened and I personally didn't see it coming nor did I doubt majority of the people who watched it. After the story took that different path you thought it was going to take before the plot twist, you still know exactly how the story is going to play it. It's kind of like it went from one predictable story plot did one big plot twist that you didn't see coming ""sure bravo"" then goes straight into another different but predictable story plot and from that point one if you took the least bit of effort to try and figure out how this is going to play out then you most likely will get it right. Now is there something wrong with being predictable? In my opinion not necessarily but it is arguable if you want to consider something predictable as ""not a con"". I personally feel if I hand to choose whether if it's a con or a pro with no gray area, I would say it's a con. I personally don't like to know what's going to happen in my stories that I'm following if it's the first time I'm watching or reading them and other than that one plot twist, I was able to see how this would played out. Another thing that bothers me about the actual body switch plot that majority of the stories that have this plot never explain how this came to be and for the sake of plot convenience rules apply according to maximum enjoyment over trying to make any common sense or rules in the universe that has been presented. It didn't sit well with me in Boku Dake Ga Inai Machi did is also and it doesn't sit well with me here also. So that's all I'll say about the story. Do I think it's bad? nah but do I think it's a masterpiece? fuck no.. but it like I'll give it some credit because it the actual plot twist was something I've never seen before but the explanation was non-existent like I said before also so it's kind of like a double edge sword for me.    
Art and Animation (9/10) Great
I thought the art style was very good I would give that an 8/10 the animation on the other had was outstanding so I'll give that a 10/10 so if you average those two out you'll get yourself what I think of this section, vibrant colors and nice scenes which were probably the best thing this movie had to offer pretty colors. 
Sound (7/10) Good
The sound of this anime movie was good... that's it... nothing more to be said.. the outro fit and so did the intro..
Characters (6/10) Fine
More Specifically (6.75/10) Fine+
It's funny as I'm writing this review I can't remember the names of the main characters seeing as that was one of the pushing plots in this fucking anime. and the shit literally translates to Your Name LOL. Ahh yes uhh.. Mitsuha and Taki that's their names.. every other character honestly isn't worth talking. But before I talk about the two main characters it would have been cool seeing as that Mitsuha's grandmother went thru the same kind of switch her grand daughter went thru I, it would have been cool if we figured out her mom died in some way related to her body switch but oh well. Anyway, Taki the Main Male Character was nothing really special just a rash kid that ends up falling for Mitsuha for no apparent reason, there's nothing really more to say about this character. Mitsuha on the other hand was a little more interesting but not by too much, I didn't understand why she felt the need to try and go on a date with Okudera and she was legit excited and disappointed that she didn't get to go on a date with another girl in a guys body, one could say ""oh she's just trying to do Taki a favor because she saw that his phone had multiple pictures of her"" but then I would say ""well like I said before the fact that she does admit that she felt disappointed that she could go on the date herself WITH ANOTHER GIRL MIND YOU"" just felt that it was more than helping out Taki, like what if she did go on that date and it got to a kiss and the end of the date? then what? would she have kissed her? It just felt like she was doing it for a favor at first but then it turned into something more personal. Anyway beyond that I personally don't see anything else to talk about when it comes to Mitsuha, I say the characters were fine but I couldn't call them good, more like boring generic and confusing than good.
Enjoyment (7/10) Good
More Specifically (7.75/10) Good+ 
Even with all of the issues I've stated above I still fairly enjoyed myself with this one. I was able to complete it in one sitting which when it comes to movies and I track record it usually takes two sittings at the least so the fact that it was able to keep my attention for an hour+ I say is a very good thing if anything else. I can't give this any high than an 7.75/10 because of the confusion on how the supernatural rules came to be and the fact that the main character was oblivious for so long how what time line he was in not even checking the date and realizing that we are not in the same timeline let alone same dimension? No.. 7.75 is as high as my enjoyment can take me for this section and I'm being generous with it.
Overall (7/10) Good
More Specifically (7.65/10) Good+
This movie was a good movie for people that like slice of life and stories in the realm of freaky friday, or body switchers should I say would get a kick out of this one, it was the plot twist in the middle that kept me going to see how it was going to end. Now I probably would have rated this higher if it went for an end that I didn't see coming or at least go for an ending that wasn't so should I say ""lazy, easy and safe""? Nothing wrong with safe, sure but you don't get any extra points by me with such a lazy ending, this is 2016 with a ton of inspirational and good story telling to pull from. Mediocre endings have been really urking me lately and it doesn't help that this fell into that point was unsatisfactory. Yeah I know this is fiction but at the end of the day you have to put some attempt to make sense of the rules of the fictional world you have created Kimi No Nawa gave no fucks when it came to explaining what the supernatural rules to the alternate timeline/dimension body switching crap it introduced. They showed us patterns on how it works then by the 80% point it stopped giving a fuck for the sake of making the audience feel for the plot in an emotional way. I can't get down with such a sloppy conclusion just to make sure the the to main characters end up with each other. Far too many questions, it seem like the writers just want you to stop thinking and just embrace your simp like emotions, cry like a bitch at how debatably touching these scenes are and give me a 10/10 because I made you cry. No.. you are a good movie but you are not a very good movie in my eyes Kimi No Nawa you have far too many flaws that i can't let you ride out with.",7,Rikuson1

                Hello guys! It's my first to review the anime. Everything I share here is from my opinion, so you can accept or deny it. ^ ^
You should admit it, indeed Shinkai Makoto is an great creator . It could be seen from  his movies, like my favorites are 5cm per second, Kotonoha no Niwa and Kimi no Na wa, which want to be reviewed.
This film gave me goosebump. you won't believe this movie after watch the intro. The story is focused on 2 characters who switch their soul to the body of a person they do not know, there's a big reason behind that.
                  (I don't want to explain in detail, JUST WATCH IT!). The story is served with soft joke, well described, reasonable.
""Supernatural"" is the element that I think taking a lot effect of the story. You will find some Japanese culture and Taoism belief, considering that Japan is the country who still preserve their culture and their belief. I found some people complain about the supernatural element in this movies. But I think it's served in good portion.
Of course, I can not explain how the perfect things should be desribed.  I think there should be more explanation when reaching the anti-climax story. but overall is okay.
""Kimi no Na wa"", It has a lot meaning after you watch the movie. Truly Masterpiece.",9,Ultraman_9823

“Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity” - Henry Van Dyke
The quote above I felt was most significant to a movie such as this because of its overarching theme of time. To express a non-linear representation of time as it captures times subjective experience. This is important to remember upon viewing as they jump quite frequently around a span of many years throughout the film.
Story: I tried to keep
                  this review as untainted by personal bias as possible, with that being said I do have a particular distaste for “Amnesia” type stories. Now to the goods…The story is quite good, it makes a particular effort to incorporate a kind of mystical god-like experience through the dialogue of the grandmother, in order to give some kind of context for the events that envelop our main characters Taki & Mitsuha. The story has a kind of teenage physical humor that reminds us of the innocence of the two main characters while still trying to develop a heart-warming tale of love from two people existing almost in separate worlds. 
Now there are some issues with the story. Firstly, the stories “ebb and flow” so to speak is a nightmare. You are constantly barraged with time leaps, and fairly expectable out comes. By the end of the film I felt a distinct feeling of wishing I was able to actually observe their relationship as a crescendo of sorts, a kind of slow build. It feels like the writing in regards to their relationship was sped up where it didn’t need to be. Yet the story slowed down for seemingly unimportant side narratives. Secondly, the ending without giving away spoilers, was tarnished in my opinion by the 8 year leap to the future from the main events of the film. It seemed lazy and improbable that all this time they had this deep desire to discover that which was dear to them and was lost. Yet not the courage to investigate some clues of the past that would have quite easily led them to each other sooner with a more involved ending to re-experience that which the characters lost and the viewer already knows to be true.
Art: I don’t have much to say other than it is simply amazing, the colour pallet was extraordinary, and made you feel as if you were truly there. The animation was vibrant, and the significance put on minutia was refreshing.
Sound: The music done by RADWIMPS, was very well done, the opening song captives your soul with a catchy exciting tune filling the viewer with anticipation. The variety was warmly welcomed as many of their songs sounded completely different, fitting many of the varying emotions throughout the film. A favorite of mine would have to be “Sparkle”. I did feel that maybe some darker themed music could have been used in certain dramatic areas of the film, but overall RADWIMPS gave a kind of rebellious life to the world of Taki and Mitsuha.
Character: I have mixed feelings about the characters and their development which I think is a good thing, because it asserts that they were well developed enough to feel anything about in the first place. I wish there would have been a deeper expression of the characters emotions for one another, and more development as to how and why such feelings came about. The characters emotions seemed hurried and sudden, almost manufactured for story purposes not naturally created due to various degrees of attraction. This made it hard for me to get completely invested in the characters, and unfortunately only skimmed the surface on these two potentially amazing characters. I felt as if there was a constant divide between me the viewer and the characters as if I was merely observing and not truly experiencing in a “along for the ride” kind of way. I do understand there were time restraints in effect to be fair, but it could have been more adequately managed. Lastly, the amnesia aspect of the movie was heavily over used in order to create drama which seemed forced and seconds later solved and quite comically used once again to throw the viewer back into anticipation. The amnesia wasn’t clearly explained, more like eluded to and acts as a persistent annoyance as it seems to constantly interrupt beautiful moments with “Wait, why am I here?”.
Overall: I found myself itching to skip ahead as I couldn’t take a single moment more of anticipation as if every second was an absolute eternity (call back to time). I stifled this desire and patiently watched on. There are many people who give this a 10/10 which I can understand from the objective, but in terms of my subjective opinion this cannot be hailed as a masterpiece. I feel the writing was too lackadaisical, and the character development which I put great importance on was greatly lacking. I think much of the inflated scores by people are due to the fact that much of anime is completely visually appealing with cheap characters and plots, so when a story comes out with some actual semblance of those things it’s a shock to the equilibrium and seems vastly greater then what it is. 
In conclusion, I would say I would highly recommend it just for the experience; all though for me it didn’t leave any lasting emotional impact or much surprise as most events could be foreseen. But it did do a good job of keeping me watching and wanting more even though I had a good idea of what was to come. Ultimately, if you go in with the expectations of your typical anime, you will come out reborn to the potential of real story writing and animation, with a soundtrack you will have on repeat for weeks.",8,DirtyDill

Story 10/10
So, first of all, for you to be able to enjoy this film you have to be able to let your imagination run freely and like romance. The story is about two people connected in time through threads. Although many might think the script is not too original, the movie also combines a few twists such as the main characters knowing each other by literally being into the other person's shoes and experiencing the other person's life. The nice thing about such an element is that it made it totally realistic for the main characters to know and deeply care about each
                  other without having seen each other like two people normally would. By the end of the movie, you reeeeally feel the main character's despair and keep hoping they do meet each other. 
Art 10/10
The drawings to me looked as good as they could get anime wise.
Sound 10/10
This movie counts with a very solid soundtrack. Although I don't speak Japanese at all, I did feel the songs were inserted at the perfect times. Specially ""Nandemonaiya"", which is going straight to my playlist. I am a very musically inclined person, therefore, songs that can convey a message or feeling beyond the language barrier deserves a 10. This song brings goosebumps every time I hear it.
Characters 9/10
Even though I really like this movie, I can't say I fell in love with the characters. I think this happened because we did not get to know them by them, meaning being in their own bodies for a long period of time, so we couldn't really see their separate stories develop before they actually meet each other (but I do understand the plot is about their love story). 
Yes! They are good characters, and I especially liked their strong will and determination to find and/or save the other (Mitsuha going to Tokyo to find Taki and Taki going to the mountains with no clues whatsoever just to try to find Mitsuha). I must say I found very heartwarming Taki's above and beyond effort of saving Mitsuha and the whole town. The ending brought me to tears just like it did them!
Enjoyment 10/10
I have watched this movie twice. The second time around was late at night, end of a very busy week, when I was really really tired, but this movie managed not only to keep me awake but at the edge of my seat the whole time (even as I had already seen it and knew the outcome!). This movie is visually great, amazing soundtrack and has a very well developed story.
Overall 9/10
I found this to ve a very emotional film and would recommend watching it. It does not waste time in trivial things (although I wonder why Mitsuha cuts her hair? And also, I don't think it was clear why Mitsuha and Taki were specifically chosen for each other...fate?). The ending is satisfying and the movie manages to keep you engaged all the way through.",9,lilkraken

                ""Her name... what is it again?""
What if one day, you dream of waking up in someone else's body? What if you find out the other person is experiencing the same? What if you find out they are not dreams, but reality after all?
Kimi no Na wa introduces to us Mitsuha and Taki, two high schoolers living out this peculiar phenomenon. When they start acting weird to the people around them periodically, and they hear stories they don't remember doing, they put two and two together. Communicating through diaries entries in smartphones, they try to navigate the other's life and get used to this strange events
                  happening at random. Until a comet falls, and they never switch bodies again. But can you really go back to normality, when you've experienced something ordinary?
I found out about this movie not too long ago. I read the synopsis, watched PVs, nothing new. But I found myself wanting to watch it, at that very moment. There were times when I couldn't stop thinking about it. Now, I have finished watching it. I loved it beyond comprehension. I have been seeing a lot of good stuff, but nothing filled the gap like Kimi no Na wa. I didn't know what I was exactly looking for, but as the ending credits started rolling, I knew that I found it.
Story: 9/10
Body-switching. What's new with that? If it's with someone away from you, I guess it is. The first part of the plot revolves around this. I found it amusing, how little by little, they changed each other's life; how by every second in another's body lets you know more about another person; how while being irked with each other, they subconsciously yearned for the day they met.
I don't want any spoilers in this review, I believe one should watch this with their mind full of guesses, not vague fragments of the story. The first half of the story was quite energetic for me, but not as exciting the latter part. To vaguely describe it, dynamic would be the word. Lots of ups and downs. A smile, followed by tears. ""Will it be a happy ending? Or will it end tragically?""  was an endless loop in my brain. Whether mild or extreme, the events will surprise you.
Art: 10/10
The PV already let me know this movie was going to be eye candy. Hundreds of stills could easily become my next wallpaper. It was definitely full of scenery, which made it feel longer than it actually is, but in a good way. These brief scenes merely showed normal objects, every day experiences, and yet they looked so visually appealing. More blood, sweat, and tears were put in these frames and they did not disappoint.
Sound: 9/10
RADWIMPS' ""Zenzenzense"" caught my attention from the first beat, and became memorable when the tune fluctuated. I later found out that the band was behind the entire soundtrack and Makoto Shinkai was a fan of them. I thought they just made rock music, but they also produced delicate melodies that I now listen to when studying. I kept myself occupied by listening to the soundtrack until I can finally watch the movie and envisioning the scenes each song would play. Amazing graphics looked so much better with the songs. My personal favorite was ""Sparkle"".
Character: 8/10
Both protagonists were just average. They weren't intellectual prodigies nor school celebrities. But give them a goal, to see the person they're switching bodies with, they will teach you bravery, they will teach you hope. They both showed that when you really want something, you go to great lengths for it. But we run out of fuel eventually, we will simply let things be. I felt connected to them in the sense that although they didn't have horrible lives, they still felt incomplete. They also learned their lessons. Rather that let fate surprise them one day, they decided they need to take a step forward, because there is not enough time in the world for everything to fall into place if they don't act now.
Enjoyment: 10/10
A good movie for me is one that lets me feel a full spectrum of emotions. Crying, laughing, those are given. But there was so much more. In between beautifully interwoven words, and majestic scenes and moving music. A few elements in the plot, I also had affinities with, e.g. diaries and celestial bodies. I would not mind if the rest of my life was the two hours I spent watching this. It was painful, very. It exhausted me. It was an inexplicable experience I liked. Many people like a movie for the story. I loved everything, and I sure as hell enjoyed it.
Overall: 10/10
I think I pretty much explained why it got this rating. I would give it more if I could. Masterpiece is an understatement. Now to try reviewing for my English test tomorrow... which will probably be futile, since this movie is going to be in my head for a long, long time.",10,krishima

                Let me be honest here, Kimi no Na wa has an amazing story and high production value. If you're looking for a pretty movie, stop reading this review and just watch it. 
However, in terms of plot this anime fell flat- because this exact plot twist has already been done! It wasn't even a shock for me, but it must have been for others if this anime is so highly rated. I'm not going to spoil what exactly happens, but Kimi no Na wa has the exact same plot twist that is shown in the anime Zetsuen no Tempest. Also compared with the fact that
                  this anime is a movie about a boy and girl that don't interact very much if at all, so there is a decreased level of emotional investment despite the melancholic scenes later on, compared to Zetsuen no Tempest which actually has some interaction between the characters and explored this plot twist in depth.
Overall, I had a lot of fun while watching this and it's definitely not bad, just has a bit of lost potential by rehashing something done before.",8,Splair

                sem comentário, só assista é você vai ver oque um filme, pode fazer com seu coração.
With the exception of maybe Dokyuusei, I can't think of a single original anime movie in recent times that has gotten as much fanfare as Makoto Shinkai's latest work did before it became available to the gaijin public. Even before it arrived in Japanese theatres, the fanbase that erupted from its exclusive Anime Expo-showing have been making their voices louder than a Siberian tiger scratching the world's largest chalkboard. And now that it has arrived in the Eastern theatres, it's made more money on its opening weekend than The Nice
                  Guys had during its entire box office run. Whilst its currently high MAL score is almost guaranteed to go down once it reaches the wider audience that is America's toxic anime fanbase, the fact remains that Shinkai has really hit the big leagues as of late, and as one of anime's last remaining auteurs (let alone one that's actually good), I think that alone should be worth celebrating.
Will he become the next Miyazaki as time goes on? I don't know, and quite frankly I doubt he cares, so why should I? This isn't a review of his career anyways. It's a review of Your Name, or Kimi no Na wa as the weeaboos like to call it, and I was really looking forward to watching this one once I discovered that the premise was about a boy and a girl going through a Freaky Friday routine, because that's usually the kind of premise reserved for a cheap harem anime or One Piece. Not something you'd expect a man of Shinkai's caliber to do, and especially not a premise deserving of so much visual porn that it'd make art students cum within five seconds of exposure. Sure when you think about it, it's not too far out of his domain. Shinkai has dabbled with putting a serious take on wacky anime premises in the past (his first major work was basically a modern take on Gunbuster after all). Still, I never really expected this sort of premise to get a big-budget treatment in general unless it was a cheap franchise movie, let alone be put in the hands of such a talented guy. And now that I've seen the result of that combination, I can safely say I should never underestimate this dude.
Now before going on, I should point out that I'm fully aware most of you guys haven't had a chance to see the movie as of this time of writing, and unfortunately I can't talk about the majority of Your Name's story because of how heavily dependent it is on things not being as clear-cut as they seem. That's right. A movie about a boy and a girl who can swap bodies with each other has a lot going on underneath the surface that I can't spoil for fear of ruining your enjoyment like all of pop culture does for Citizen Kane. So let's just start off by saying that I do recommend Your Name. It's easily one of the best anime I've seen this year (not that the competition has been all that fierce) as well as one of the most emotional roller coasters that I've seen this medium produce in quite a long time. Oh, and if you are even slightly interested in shipping culture, there is a 99% chance that you will consider this movie a masterpiece, because it pretty much hits every major shipping button in the book - including ones that most hardcore shippers didn't know they had. If you want a more visual representation of what I'm talking about, remember what you loved about ERASED before it went to shit. Now imagine that show never going to shit and make sure to step out of that puddle of drool and tears you just made.
The tone of Your Name is distinctively more ""anime"" than most of Shinkai's stuff. It felt like he was trying to cater more to a mainstream audience whilst not sacrificing his signature style in the process throughout the entire runtime, and if the later Persona games are anything to go by, that can really pay off if done well. And it does pay off in quite a few ways I didn't expect. The movie made me laugh a lot, even at jokes that I wouldn't normally laugh at, and the story actually progressed in a way that I wanted to see things end happily rather than the usual bittersweet closures that I generally love about this guy's take on romance. And any anime that can get that amount of investment from me is always worth my time, even if the characters themselves don't have too much going for them individually.
Having to look up their names for this review is one thing because I'm bad at remember names in general, let alone foreign ones. But if you were to ask me to describe the two leads, I wouldn't have much to say besides a normal girl who wants to be free of the traditions set on her by her family and a normal boy who just wants to get by in life. I think it was an intentional decision on Shinkai's part to make his characters ""normal"" so that we can relate to them more and they're both likable/interesting enough, but I prefer characters who have story to them first, and relatability second. And it's hard to get too invested in a character's dilemma when I'm not given a non-circumstantial reason regarding why I'd want to follow this character in the first place.
For example, the main boy's name is Taki Tachibana, and his goals in life are to get into university, get closer to his hot female co-worker at the restaurant he does part-time work in, and grope his own breasts when he suddenly discovers he has them. That's stuff you can say about any normal Joe, and whilst I can definitely relate to those issues enough to not find Taki boring, the sort of connection I can form with him from just that is limited when I'm not the one who's actually experiencing those problems first-hand. Even when the movie gets into deeper material, Taki never really experiences any emotions or problems that are particular complex to analyze. And considering Shinkai has managed to balance both the intellectual and the emotional aspects of his stories in the past, I found the heavy emphasis on the latter at the expense of the former to be kinda disappointing. Hell, even the majority of Ghibli's output after they peaked did a pretty decent job in that department. Maybe my opinion will change if I watch the movie again (and you can bet I will), but I'm just going to say right now that I liked the character presentation in 5/cm. You fanboys may call it emotionally distant. I call it the solution to you guys overrating the hell out of Holo and Lawrence's thing.
But let's move on to another aspect of Your Name I can actually talk about: the technicals. Frankly, I am quite amazed at how much Shinkai is improving in that field, especially considering how high he sets the bar with each film he does. Not only is the visual quality of the animation so stunning that it makes Garden of Words look like someone's Flash animation and the Radwimps soundtrack one of the most fun anime soundtracks I've heard in quite some time, but the way he utilizes these technicals is so masterful that it can make even the most basic of emotions expressed throughout this film feel like you've just been hit in the face and you want more because you love it. I'm really hard-pressed to come up with a cartoon that gets emotional storytelling down the way the animation in this one does, even compared to what I consider superior cartoons like Kaiba, Haibane Renmei, or a good chunk of Pixar's output. Hell, I'd need a whole other post (and a digital file of the film) just to talk about the specifics.
A lot of you guys are watching Re:Zero, right? Well let's put it like this: if White Fox's ""masterful"" direction of Subaru's bawl-fests is the equivalent of getting hit with a cannonball, Your Name's direction of the emotions constantly vibrating in its characters, setting, dialogue, and just about everything that makes up a single frame of this film is the equivalent of getting hit with a cannonball the size of Jupiter, and there are thousands more frames where that came from. It knows when to play it light. It knows when to play it heavy. It knows just the right amount to make it seem natural. And it doesn't sacrifice more important things in the process. Well okay, I just said it sacrificed some important things a few paragraphs ago. But never to the extent that I ever walked out thinking to myself ""well that was good enough"". The Boy and the Beast is an anime I consider ""good enough"". Your Name is plain good, regardless of the actual magnitude of positive feelings I have for it.
I really wish I could talk more about the plot with you guys, but I can't. Not even regarding the movie's themes, which I'm still not quite clear on myself, but I will tell you that part of the movie's plot was inspired by Japan's recent earthquake disasters. However, I only knew this because Shinkai himself told us. Otherwise, I would never have made the connection, because the ""event"" that said inspiration is based on...well let's just say depending on your suspension of disbelief, you'll consider it emotionally heart-breaking or completely arbitrary. I'm not for heavy-handed commentary or anything, but if there is a deeper meaning that I'm missing in Your Name that'd make me join on the ""masterpiece"" bandwagon with the rest of the die-hards, I really think Shinkai should have made it more obvious. After all, some anvils just need to be dropped, because otherwise you'll risk the opposite problem of people reading too much into things. There's open to interpretation, and then there's just laying out a bunch of plot elements and telling your audience to make their own story.
Don't take my word for it though. Watch the movie yourself and come to your own conclusions. Or watch it because this review has just a raised a million questions regarding what the hell could possibly be in Your Name that's making me so cryptic in regards to describing the experience. Either way works fine. Just don't get spoiled before diving in. You'll probably still enjoy the movie regardless, but there can only be one moment of discovery, and no one should have the right to take it away from you but yourself. And even then, only when you decide that you are ready.",10,Davvos

                OK, I'm gonna start this review with 2 things:
- I literally signed up just to review this
- I have re-watched this film for at least 25 times and already lost count.
Plot: 9.5/10 (MAL 10)
Art: ∞/10 (MAL 10)
Character: 9.9/10 (MAL 10)
Sound: 11/10 (MAL 10)
Enjoyment: ∞/10 (MAL 10)
Overall: ∞/10 (MAL 10)
Plot:
The story is not simple, or way too complex, fairly easy to understand, if you pay enough attention to the movie itself. THAT IS, for the first time you watch it. Over the time you re-watch the anime, you will realize the brilliantly placed hints that the director dropped in. If you have already watched a lot of anime, the story is higher than decent, but hasn't reached the masterpiece level. slightly predictable, though the enjoyment is not lost. Makoto Shinkai has executed the advancement of the film greatly. It progresses slowly and fast at the right spots, which is what I am really impressed of.
The ending is just so d*mn beautiful, can be said as one of the best endings I have ever seen in anime and manga.
TL;DR: The story is cool
Art:
""Top-notch"", ""masterpiece"". ""so beautiful it looks better than real life"" is what comes to my mind when I think of Kimi no nawa's art. As expected from Makoto Shinkai and ComixWave. The amount of details is not something you can expect of if you have never watched any of Makoto's previous pieces. Even the rays of sunlight, the breath in cold air, the traffic lights are taken account of. To admit, I was so atonished of the art that I sometimes wonder if this is real life, or it is just a fantasy.
TL;DR: The art is just unbelievably beautiful.
Characters:
2 protagonists. is that all?
The character development is extremely noticable, but with the right portion so that you cannot say something like: ""Who the hell is he/she?"".
The world revolves. Not only the protagonists are in active. The youthful and carefree highschool students, the wisdom of the elders, the joyful little children, full-minded adults in the society, from urban to rural, with each and every different personalities create such a beautiful, lively world around our protagonists.
TL;DR: The characters from important to unimportant ones are fantastic.
Sound:
Terrific, emotional, warming, beautiful soundtracks (composed and performed by RADWIMPS) that fit in the film so perfectly. Without these wonderful sountracks, the film would have lose 50% of its enjoyment. The sountracks are so great, I have the entire album in my playlist.
TL;DR: RADWIMPS performed this. It's really awesome.
Enjoyment:
OH MAH F**KING GAWD I LOVE THIS DAMN FILM. I HAVE LOST COUNT OF THE TIMES I RE-WATCH.
Overall:
Kimi no nawa- the latest masterpiece made by our one and only: MAKOTO SHINKAI. It is simply beautiful. A true masterpiece which we can only get once in a decade. It will be a rollercoaster of emotions, the definition of true art. Kimi no nawa will stay as one of the best anime in the entire medium. A must-watch for every anime fan, from new to veteran and to the people who has not even a slightest idea of what anime is.

                This anime was amazing all around it has beautiful animation, great characters and story, and a dub that does the original justice. It was hard to not pay attention, it pulls you right in and doesn't let go. It is an emotional roller coaster that doesn't end. It is definitely my favorite anime ever. The characters are realistic and down to earth. The animation is beautiful and fluid. Both the Japanese and English voice acting were amazing. I don't usually get emotional at shows and movies, but this one had me going. I went in knowing next to nothing but picked it up easy then
                  it shifted gears and suddenly I'm completely invested. I highly recommend this to anyone but suggest tissues on hand.",10,REXXltm

                A nice film that I don’t really love, or feel the burning need to re-watch in the future. Its narrative is bogged down by overly familiar plot devices and predictable trajectory, but it works as a populist love story with very accomplished audiovisual execution. 
(mild spoilers ahead)
It’s interesting to see how simultaneously similar and different Your Name is to Makoto Shinkai’s previous works. It used many of the same foundational elements, but it is also antithetical to his “relationship (particularly long-distance one) sucks and often doesn’t work” theme. This one is unapologetically romantic, much sweeter and more appealing to the mass. It also has a
                  staggering number of fantastical narrative devices: body switch shenanigan, parallel timeline, natural apocalypse, sci-fi phenomenon, and spiritual journey. In retrospect, it’s a minor miracle how Shinkai can pack all of these in relatively lean running time and prevent the movie from turning into a mess, which is a testament to his remarkable adeptness at visual story-telling (honestly, I'd love to see him branch out into other themes and narratives in the future).  
This film is obviously pretty, but there is a lot of craft to appreciate beyond just digitized eye candy.  Establishing shots are frequently used to highlight the contrast between the two main characters’ hometown, the science and supernatural, and the physical and ethereal realm. There are remarkable details on the real life landscapes brought to the screen, as well as on the interior shots depicting the characters’ private room. The latter is a particularly nifty way to visualize the characters’ personality and interests, even more so in a feature length movie that lacks the time to flesh out the characters. The movie is expertly storyboarded and edited in general, making it easy for the audience to intuitively figure out the multiple timelines and chronological transition in due time (without having to rely on textual marker such as ‘three years later..’). 
Perhaps even more so than the visual, the music really makes the movie. They knocked it out of the park with their choice of band, Radwimps, who contributed an album’s worth of songs for the movie. The vocalist’s silky voice, sweet rock melody, and evocative lyric combine for a handful of perfectly timed songs, and instrumental piano-driven tunes also build the mood of many given scenes. Further, many props to the two lead voice actors, each of them tasked to portray two different characters and carry many of the film’s emotional moments, which they did with aplomb.
Thing is, once you strip away the technical and aesthetic elements, it’s just a generic story with fantastical cliches and underdeveloped characters. 
I like the early sequence depicting the life of the main female character, but most other things that happen afterward are less interesting, funny, and authentic. Characters end up not being defined and developed enough that I can say I really know, understand, or empathize with them. There’s a certain point where character development completely gives way to the plot, and again, it’s a plot that you’ve probably seen elsewhere in many forms. The ending alone is basically a textbook Korean Drama Ending, while the conflict that leads up to the climax (boy rewind time to save girl he loves) is a popular narrative trend that can be seen in a bunch of anime shows and other narrative media that came out this recent years. 
Then again, a familiar story can still be made compelling through powerful sensory execution, and that’s exactly what happened here.  I personally don’t rate this film that highly, or even among the best of anime films that recently came out—Anthem of The Heart is thematically stronger and paints teenage relationship in more nuanced and authentic manner, and as pretty as Your Name is, it still doesn’t come close to the transcendental beauty of Tale of Princess Kaguya. However, I also can’t disagree that it’s such a well-presented product that had moved the heart of countless people worldwide, and there’s genuine value in that.",6,Beobachter

                Kimi No Na Wa.
I decided to give my first ever review in MAL to 'Your Name' because I simply couldn't contain anymore the appreciation I have towards the show.
Not sure how can I explain something so magnificent, heart-warming and sentimental at the same time in few words. This show gives the viewers a glimpse of What-Ifs 'second-chance' scenario that doesn't exist in real world.
I guess that's one of the selling points of this movie in addition to its near-perfect Animation quality. I love it and scored it 10/10.
The sound track is also on par with the animation as it faithfully depicts the ambiance of every
                  scenes. I'm not really a fan of Japanese OST but I'll give this one a an exception. Excellent job to RADWIMPS for performing something I will never forget as I age.
The execution of the story particularly the main characters' interaction to each other is picture-perfect. I honestly wasn't hoping too much as I've already watched too many body-swapping shows but darn... the latent story caught me off guard. 
That's when I realized this is not just your typical generic movie that only wants to be watched but wants you to remember it as a masterpiece.
Overall, this show will leave you satisfied unlike other shows that sells cliff-hanger open endings. I'm glad the creator decided to go to this route.

                I rarely give a Anime or Movie this much praise yet this Movie was a different experience for me. I haven't been able to watch a Anime and enjoy it as much due to this movie as nothing can Compare. It had a Great Story, Amazing Art and Soundtracks, Characters were pretty good, It was enjoyable and overall just outstanding. I sat in silence as i watched it and got lost in its beauty and i don't care for romances usually. This movie keeps you guessing its filled with curve balls that are hard to see coming. You have to watch every moment closely or
                  you could get lost and confused.",10,Web555
32281,"
                I try keep my reviews short & sweet without spoilers. This is for anyone on the fence as to whether or not to watch this show. So the question you're probably asking is; is this show worth my time? The answer being; fans of the romance, drama and/or great animation will definitely find their time well spent on this anime. Below I will expand on my thoughts as to why I believe so.
Story & Character (7)
""Why am I crying?""
Taki & Mitsuha questioned themselves. A mutual feeling I often asked myself during the show as well. The genius that is Makota Shinkai is brought to the
                  table once again, and in a collaboration of amazing art, sound & story we are lead on a roller coaster ride of emotions. I felt movies always suffered through a lack of character development, or were too short for us to actually feel a connection with its characters, but Kimi No Na Wa proves me wrong. 
I felt the story, though generic in the whole body swap freaky friday occurrence, there is a slight twist in the fact nobody remembers what they did in the body they've swapped into. Which leads to a few awkward yet hilarious moments as well as the characters figuring out how to eventually communicate with each other upon swapping, I felt this was well paced and not rushed. Kimi No Na Wa does well to realize it is a movie with limited time, and doesn't shift its focus off Taki or Mitsuha, though additional characters are introduced, Kimi No Na Wa doesn't try to do too much and make a mess of things. Something I've often witnessed in movies without a series. 
One thing I really want to mention is if you ever felt frustrated with a male MC not taking the reins, or being too shy to do anything to the babes you see in every anime you tend to watch. Do not fear, because Taki does everything any young man would do upon swapping into a woman's body. I salute him and his teenage hormones. 
Art & Sound (9)
I will touch on this only briefly, as I believe the animation in this was unreal. I watched it on Blu-Ray and paid for it on amazon. It would definitely be something I'd show someone who was trying to get into anime just to showcase how eye-catching anime can be when done right. As for sounds, I felt the voice acting was great and felt it was never out of place nor cheesy. One thing I cannot stand is forced lines or characters just saying each others names over and over again while cueing the dramatic music. That does just not do it for me, I'm glad Kimi No Na Wa doesn't take this route but instead draws on the relativity of how we instead are always looking for someone, someone we feel who is out there, we are fated to meet, but just haven't met yet. Feelings of hope to eventually meet this person and the emptiness of still being alone intertwined into one big roller coaster ride which feels purposely crafted by Shinkai Makoto to tug on the heart strings of the audience who might've once felt the pain of lost love. 
Overall (8) -
Overall, an enjoyable experience I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre. Even if you aren't I would still say give this movie a shot. Tip-Top animation complimented by great voice acting and music, the heartwarming story of Kimi No na Wa will have you laughing in your seat and without revealing too much possibly shedding a tear at the frustration of how sometimes communication gets lost or confused, and we never get to really say the things we want to say. So we just need to take that step back and ask the questions which are important. I loved this movie and hope you will too. Thanks for reading.",8,V4mpyr

                Simply breathtaking is the only way I could describe it. From the spot on art with the vibrant colors to the soundtrack that fit in perfectly Kimi No Nawa is nothing less of a masterpiece. 
Storywise its funny and interessting and at certain points puts a knife to your throat and other times warms your heart and fills it with both warmth and joy. However it feelt a bit lacking in some ways and maybe a bit incomplete, but it let's you decide for yourself. 
The way the soundtrack fits in is truely astonishing and was done masterfully.
The characters had their shortcomings in feeling a
                  bit shallow but it didn't  end up ruining the overall expreience of the movie.",10,Kewi

                Honestly, if I were to rate Your Name based on story alone, it probably would not receive the same score. It is not a mind-blowing plot, nor is it terribly intricate, nor is it wholly coherent. There are holes in the story here and there as well as some developments that are hard to believe. But all that comes second to the most important factor: how the movie makes you feel.
Watching this film is liberating. It is a beautiful story elevated through even more captivating art that provides a level of emotional stimulus simply impossible to find in a live action Hollywood movie. It is
                  so full of raw emotion that plot becomes secondary to a single burning hope that, while timid in the beginning, erupts into an all-consuming desire.
Part of that emotion stems from the movie's authenticity and its delivery. Your Name is a depiction of adolescent freedom and agency that is raw and personal. Characters aren't drawn as archetypes or following any tropes, but as actual people who are relatable and enjoyable to watch. In addition, their reactions to the supernatural phenomena around them and their interactions with each other are all depicted in a very realistic manner. The story follows its own lively and engaging rhythm, in which well-timed comedy is juxtaposed with excruciatingly timed drama. And even more impressively, the story touches upon its themes without getting lost in them; modern meets traditional, youth meets adult, rural meets urban, all wrapped into a film about a meteor and body swap. And not a single moment feels ill-paced. 
This is complemented by visceral artwork that forces one to feel his/her way through the movie in awe and a soundtrack that heightens the emotional atmosphere that the art conjures. Throughout the first and second act of the film, the movie's stunning visual and auditory components make the story that much more engaging. But come the third act is where they truly go to the next level. The shots are jaw-dropping and the music is heart-wrenching, and they both work in flawless conjunction with the story, pulling the audience along into an unforgettable and cathartic end.",10,bigctai

                Kimi no na wa was a movie that had a whole lot of hype behind it, and usually that means that expectations are set sky high and are almost never met, with few exceptions.
Kimi no na wa is defiantly an exception.
Story- 9
The story of kimi no na wa is original and refreshing. The start is somewhat confusing and hard to grasp however it gets moving soon after. The story is fulfilling and enjoyable and from what i have experienced, cliches are sparse (which is very good as this type of story is normally cliche to the max). Could have been 10/10 if the first 10
                  minutes were abit more normal.
Art- 10
Not much to say, the art is outstanding and honestly one of the best I've ever seen. The movie spends some time to showcase the art and surprisingly it does not hinder the story, as in some animes doing this can somewhat ruin the story.
Sound- 10
Music is fitting and beautiful. OP and ED are good and will probably find their way into my playlist if i can get it. Voice actors are actually brilliant. I liked how they used a child to voice yotsuha. THe voices are very refreshing and sometimes i find that they are relaxing. Background music enhances scenes and brings beauty and elegance to the movie. 
Character- 10
This movie is worth about 5 episodes of anime. Yet the character development is better then some 20 episode anime. How they did this in 1 hour and 35ish minutes truly blows me away (I havent watched many anime movies mind you). At about the half way mark i find myself attached to most of the main and side characters in the movie, aswell as hating the character that was meant to be hated (no spoilers :P). Honestly the male MC is one of my favorites to date aswell which is a bonus xD. Characters maketh the anime and the characters are truly something else.
Enjoyment- 10
This anime is a masterpiece and theres seriously no other way to describe it. Its funnny, heart warming, heart breaking, heart wrenching, romantic and 100% enjoyable. My only complaint at this time is that i cant experience what i experienced when i first completed it, as that feeling was seriously something that i really dont feel often. 
Overall- 10 
Whether you're into romance, mecha, action (ok maybe not so much this), or literally anything else i can assure you that you will enjoy it. Some maybe more then others but you will with out a doubt love it. Seriously I 101% suggest anyone to watch it. Enjoy :P",10,Nicbint

                ""It feels really different from a typical Shinkai movie!""
""It's good but not as good as A Silent Voice!""
""Best Anime movie ever!""
Those are some of the things I've heard about ""Your Name."" before I actually saw the movie. The first I mostly agree with. The second ... I feel they're about the same, but what puzzles me is why the two keeps getting compared, as they don't seem all that similar to me. As for the third statement, well, it actually contradicts the second, and no one I know actually said that, but I extrapolated it from the MAL rankings where it currently sits at #2
                  behind a TV series. At any rate, I don't think it's the best anime movie ever. 
However, it might just be the best Shinkai movie ever.
Makoto Shinkai's movies have traditionally been mood-driven pieces hanging off what is often a single plot point. ""Your Name."" ... ok I can't hold this in any longer: which marketing genius decided to use this lame literal translation, complete with full stop, as the official English title?? If it didn't make such a big splash, I can just imagine a conversation unfolding like: ""Hey, do you wanna go see Your Name full stop?"" ""What the fuck is that?? Sounds shite!""
Anyway, where was I? Ahh yes. ""Your Name."" breaks with the traditional Shinkai formula by actually having a story. Not just any story either, a story about a body swap situation involving two school kids who have never met each other. Body swap anime have often stuck me as low brow comedies designed to milk the fuck out of the ""boy play with his new found boobs"" type jokes. To be fair, ""Your Name."" has a bit of that too. But it also has a lot more to offer.
""Your Name."" is a movie of three thirds.
The first third is pleasantly surprising. I couldn't tell that it was a Shinkai movie at all - even the character designs look different! The lethargic melancholy I have come to expect is nowhere in sight. Instead, Shinkai has taken this body swap premise and made it energetic, entertaining and meaningful. Perhaps most shockingly of all, I discovered that Shinkai has a sense of humour! What also impressed me was that somehow, without meeting each other, the main characters came to know and influence one another intimately, and how their interactions formed the centrepiece of the narrative.
In the second third, ""Your Name."" switches modes, and the plot thickens into a mystery. In retrospect, this is where the creator's fingerprints started to appear: the feeling of trying to hold on to something ephemeral, and the feeling of longing for something that's just out of reach are all present here. This is not meant as a criticism, however, especially since the substantial storyline ensures that the themes are built on much more solid ground in this movie.
The final third is more of a mixed bag. In particular, I didn't like the ending. It was as though, having been held back for most of the movie, Shinkai was finally unleashed onto the production. Over sentimental and face palmingly frustrating, the last few minutes of the movie amplified most of the creator's tendencies to a fault. And that ruined it a bit for me.
Still, ""Your Name."" is a very solid movie. And while the anime's international success is a testament to its accessibility, it's also uniquely Japanese at heart. The film is laden with commentary on the country's dwindling rural communities and reflects the anxieties of an island nation buffetted by frequent natural disasters. Non-Japanese viewers might simply enjoy ""Your Name."", but for the Japanese, I suspect it resonated.
After watching ""Your Name."", it occurred to me that even though the movie looked great, there's a shortage of stunning set pieces of scenery that usually proliferate through Shinkai's works. I guess when you've got an actual story to tell, you just don't have time to sit around and stare at clouds.

This is my first time writing a review as I am generally really impressed about this anime and the overall 
impression it left behind. (i'll try to write without spoiling it to much. >.<'')Story:
The story is very elaborate, it may be cliche for some who has watched a lot of, for example; Korean dramas or
general love story that has a twist of fantasy. But it in the end it really leaves an impression that ""this is a genuine anime""
and it expresses what the artist wish to convey through the anime. Overall the story for 'me' has really left
me inspired as I am quite intrigued/interested with the eastern culture of fate/love (to put it simply.)
Art:
The art is probably one of the best i'v seen in awhile. Its one of those art styles where it indulges you into the
anime atmosphere and you can really feel the passion/thrive that has been put into the story. Personally the art is 
very similar to 'Children Who Chase Lost Voices' and 'Garden of Words' and from this we can really see what sort 
of a story it takes to even have a composition between a great art work and a compelling story. To sum it up, personally
I don't really know much about the studios who creates these sort of art composition, but you can really see
how much time they must have put into making it look flawless and eye catching ! (To speak in
more artsy terms, everything has been well layered and cohesive. It seems to me that have used a mix of 
digital art and painting which really brings out the exposure of the art as well as the passion and interest that
has been put into making this story.
Sound:
The sound is smooth and blends well as whole like the art of this anime. However it seems that I can hear static
sounds in between scenes that kills the vibe of the anime, but to say it isn't significant enough to say it ruins it completely.
But overall as a whole the sounds,OST,OP and ed are all great ! and it really spices up the whole anime tone of
the story. I personally for once really liked the songs that were played within the movie as I think genuinely they did well
on picking on what band should be played on certain parts.
Characters:
The characters were great to per say ! but I must admit that the main characters were a little peculiar at times. However
the characters are really enjoyable to watch as you can really relate if you lived in a town/country side for all your life !
And it seem that there is a lot of great morals to learn within this anime that I personally see all ages should learn ~.~''.
Looking at the 2 main characters in my perspective, you can really see that they are generally quirky, down to earth,
mediocreish, genuine and well perspective characters like a normal person, which i'm sure most of us could find relatable.
Overall:
In conclusion ! the anime doesn't seem to have anything that I could say that I didn't like and for the time (2016) it 
was released. I genuinely think it is a quite original, outgoing and well diverse within the anime realm and would 
recommend for all ages or if not to teenagers or older. 
For me I really like animes to do with love, that has a twist of eastern culture views, such as the 'string of fate/love'. As it something
I find interesting and something I could 'see' and sense in my day to day life. (if you like romance animes then I recommend for you.)",10,SeungMin

                After 5 Centimeters per Second, I was hesitant to pick up another romance story from Makoto Shinkai. It's not that I hated the last one. I actually loved it. But the ending just saddened me and I didn't want to see another story like that. So, with much hesitation, I picked up Kimi No Na Wa. 
In short, this movie is every bit a masterpiece as everyone says it is. You can definitely see the amount of dedication that was put into this movie. 
The story revolves around Taki and Mitsuha, a boy from Tokyo and a girl from the countryside. By unexplainable circumstances, they
                  find themselves switching bodies at random. That is the basic gist of the story, which eventually evolves into an amazing romance that transcends time and space. Small details which you initially thought were minor are major plot devices to drive the story forward. There are plenty of moments where you laugh, moments where you cry, and moments where you just scream at the screen just wanting them together. Overall, the story is something that I would call among the best I have watched. 
It's a definite given that art in a Makoto Shinkai movie is going to be excellent. This one is no different. The visuals capture your eyes, and you definitely need more than two eyes to grasp everything. Colors are absolutely vibrant and the scenery looks good enough to transport you there. Every minute detail is considered and painstakingly crafted. 
The characters are something I quite enjoyed. I was worried that they might be generic MCs. But they've been crafted well. Mitsuha is a shy countryside girl who just wants to escape her boring rural life and escape into the city. Taki is a boy who is trudging through life, as any city-dweller wants. But their personalities spark when they swap, bringing their own quirks into the other person's life. My personal favorite is Mitsuha with her countryside quirks and dialects. In my opinion, she definitely stole the show, even if by a very slight margin. 
RADWIMPS did the soundtrack for this movie. I heard that Makoto wanted them because he wanted to appeal to a younger audience. But they've struck a subtle balance between beauty and youthful appeal. It's still something I listen to almost everyday. 
If you're looking for an amazing romance, then this is not to be missed. It will leave you laughing and crying all the way through. I will definitely rewatch this when the Blu Ray comes out. Definitely give this a shot. You will not regret it.",10,Keiba

Kimi no Na wa (Your Name.) was just brilliant! If you like animes with amazing stories, lovely caracters that when you watch it You will feel like you were actually there THIS IS A THING THAT YOU SHOULD WATCH! 
While watching the anime I couldn't ever guess what was going to happen and that messed my emotions. The power of this anime is amazing... I cried , I smile ... I felt that I wanted to make something  I felt that we were always sharing the same emotions and that was something that didn't happen to me a long time ago.
When I saw
                  that this movie was rank 1 I thought that something should be wrong but now that I watched it I totally agree with it, for me is just amazing!
I hope this review made you wanna watch this movie!

                The first thing you need to know about this movie is that it was absolutely gorgeous. The animation was every bit as good as I heard it'd be, the sound design, holy freaking cow, literally every single scene was just about perfect. I could watch this movie a hundred times and still be in love with the experience of watching it.
Now the story and characters. These could potentially be seen as weaknesses, we don't get much explanation in the ""why"" behind the things that spur the plot forward, and we don't actually get to know the main characters that well at all, but instead of
                  being a detriment, I'd say this is one of the film's greatest strengths. This is a deeply first person(s) experience, not understanding why this is happening is an integral part of their experience. Going to the trouble of explaining everything to the audience not only would've wasted time, it would have conflicted heavily with the personal nature this film tries to create, and I'm glad they didn't. As for the characters, a large part of the film is about getting to know someone purely from how people interact with them when you're in their body, and how people interact with you after they've been in your body.
Just to be clear, there are definitely nit picky plot holes to be had and quite a bit of suspension of disbelief required, but they didn't break the experience for me, because this wasn't about the story or the characters, it was about the experience. They said it themselves, memories fade, you'll forget specifically what happens, and why it happened, but you always have that nostalgiac feeling, and that's what they were going for, and man did they hit it on the head. Just sit back and enjoy the experience",10,kairyu_gen1

                Like many I find myself bewitched by this film in a way I can't explain. To avoid being typical I'll just state exactly how I feel. 
Going into this movie with absolutely no expectation or even hint at what kind of story I was to be presented with is what made Kimi no Na wa so much better for me. The animation is absolutely beautiful, it hits my sweet spot exactly when it comes to a visual style that is not overly complex yet beautiful in its own way. 
The characterisation is done in such a way that you do not lose focus at all
                  of our two main characters, but at the same time are constantly treated with many aspects of the others lives.
The soundtrack while incredibly simple compliments the visually bombarding aspect of the film by offering a relatively relaxing break from the films constant tenseness. The lower score I have added refers more to actual SFX rather than music.
My enjoyment I felt watching this film from start to finish is unlike almost any other I have had. I've seen hundreds of films in my life, probably 95% of them not being Anime related. But that small, and also significant 5% will forever be dominated by Kimi no Na wa, it has changed my love for the genre forever, I will never forget it.",9,bluetayden

                This is an analytical review on the movie's story, direction and themes. IT WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS, so read at your own discretion.
DIRECTION & WRITING
The primary focus of Your Name is on love with the main intent of uplifting people’s spirits through entertainment and a therapeutic recovery from the trauma of the 2011 tsunami and earthquake in Japan. The entertainment aspect of it is achieved through a well tonally structured script and well paced out climaxes. It leads the audience in with light hearted comedy and intrigue, but progressively becomes more intriguing with its unpredictability. The interesting plot beats of events and revelation are placed throughout the film instead of being clumped together which helps to break up long sequences, preventing them from becoming boring or overwhelming. The script is tight and focused, every scene served a purpose. Either if it’s for establishing characters, character feelings, entertainment, plot or the theme.
The choice of individual supernatural ideas themselves were not really related to the narrative’s through line but was used well for entertainment. The body swap offered comedy, characterization and a fresh take on the way a traditional love story could be developed by having the leads learn about each other in the most intimate way possible though living their life. The time gap/time travel offered mystery, unpredictability and a far more dramatic revelation for the comet disaster compared to if the events were to occur concurrent with Taki’s timeline.
The film is also therapeutic in a wish fulfilment sense. It sharply captures the feelings of shock and sadness that comes from the loss of someone dear but also creates a fantasy in which the audience can find happiness and satisfaction experiencing what it would be like turning back the clock and rescuing the one you love.
In a sense the creative decisions Shinkai made are designed for commercial appeal as oppose to philosophical commentary, but at its core it’s still a very passionate and personal project.
THEME
Your Name tries to evoke the feeling of longing to be with someone you love as well as the yearning to find someone who is fated and destined to be with you. This entire film is conceived with the idea of the leads meeting at the end as strangers but in a predestined way. Just like how we might meet someone coincidentally who may end up to be your life long partner. It captures that feeling that most people dream of, especially when they are in their youth. 
Shinkai’s previous films like 5cm per Second is also about love, but has a clearer message conveyed. Conveying the emotions of star crossed lovers has always been a particular interest for Shinkai, the message we take out from it is just a by-product of this particular emotion that he explores. Your name feels like it has a less obvious message simply because Shinkai explores the feeling of external influences like natural disasters separating people this time around. It’s a much more simpler emotion of yearning compared to the internal conflicts personal explored in 5cm and garden of words, and thus has less commentary to it if you choose to interpret. However, this time around the theme of separation is secondary to the yearning of fated love.
The setting and the supernatural elements are used to demonstrate this feeling of longing as devices that create distance between the leads. From contrast of the city and rural, past and present and transient nature of memories from dreams. The braided cord is an allusion to the red string of fate is used to symbolize the leads being connected by fate. The body swapping allows the leads to develop feelings for each other without them actually meet and interact in person. Their interactions are portrayed as dreams and thus their memories of each other would fade easily while the feeling they have for each other stays. I think this film was able to carry through the feeling of longing to be with someone that you are fated to be with without actually knowing who they are when you view it from the character’s perspective. This film guides the audience to feel this way in an easy to understand approach. If the movie only showed the individual lives of Mitsuha and Taki without them interacting and having them meet at the end it wouldn’t capture the idea of fate because we wouldn’t know how if these two characters will love each other. I think the execution was able to evoke this very complex emotion of yearning but unknown love in an easy to understand way. 
Your Name is a very traditional love story as it explores love in a very idealistic and romantic sense. The obstacles between them aren’t interpersonal problems, but external forces. It infuses with all these contemporary elements that makes the storytelling feel fresh and relevant and easy to watch for the modern audience. In a way, it feels contemporary and traditional at the same time.
ROMANCE
Your Name isn’t particularly focused on developing a conventional love story between the leads. If you expect it to be a story about their relationship than you might come out feeling unconvinced by their love for each other, because it’s more interested capturing this particular emotion of yearning for connection and fate. It cares about its characters, and it cares about showing that the leads love one another but not much beyond that. It does leave their relationship development more to be desired. I think even a single scene where the leads share a special moment before they are separated would make it far more effective. My most highly rated shows are ones that either builds emotional invest for me from the ground up (Eureka 7, love live) or it was relatable so I can invest in it without that emotional bridge building (shirobako, death parade, oregairu, sakurasou). This film wasn’t able to build the love story from the ground up for me and I wasn’t able to be fully relate because I’ve never been in love in a romantic sense. However, I can see how this would be more emotional for people who has been in love especially during their adolescence, and can relate to lead’s yearning for each other when they are separated. While I didn’t resonate with the nostalgic adolescent feelings that your name tries to evoke in, it certainly made me yearn for love, fate and a sense of journey in an inexplicable way.",10,PoLoBreak

                I felt as if this film was amazing a just a pure spectacle. While the story did have loop holes in it, they weren't bad enough to detract from the film.
The music was outstanding coming from someone who, ordinarily wouldn't listen to that genre. The art style is without doubt, the greatest I've ever seen in cinema history. The clever use of camera shots and scenery really add to this.
The film is entertaining in it's own rights as I remember audibly laughing a few times. Although I did feel as if some bits were repeated a couple of times too many and did eventually become
                  a little bit less funny each time and in one case, annoying.
The story isn't perfect as it's fairly predictable but entertaining none the less.
Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone, fan of anime or not.
To conclude, I gave this a 10 because, in very few cases have I been awed by a film to the extend this amazed me to. Please do watch it and support the company who made this.",10,Jacobitin

                Kimi no Na wa, aka ""Your Name is,"" is the latest hot movie to release. Being a new movie makes it edgy, helping to boost it's popularity until the next big animation film releases.  But does it succeed as a movie? For the most part, yes.
Movies have some things going in their favor and other things working against them when compared to a series, which runs on average between 12-26 episodes. Animation is always smoother and more polished, and since they tend to run between 90 to 120 minutes in length, they can be seen in one sitting with friends. This can also be
                  to it's detriment however, since less time to tell a story can often lead to that story being confusing. With only a limited amount of time, plots need to be simplistic in order to fit and make sense. Thankfully with that smaller time frame, excessive monologuing, a recurring problem with anime, is generally kept out.
So with all of that in mind, Kimi no Na wa does a good enough job with it's story, despite it's basic premise being nothing more than a tale about body-swapping. There are a few unforeseen twists, enough of a focus on the two main characters to make you care, and a (mostly) unique story. Not necessarily in it's basic plot, but in it's presentation. When the twists do arrive and the story reaches it's climax, it throws a few gut punches, which hit more often than not. I found myself rooting for the main duo and even choking up at a few parts, despite the characters being fairly basic.
The story is not without it's faults. First, I've seen more than one ""body-swapping"" film, so the idea isn't exactly fresh. The two who are swapping are a boy and a girl which does give it some unique flavor, however they also forget things when they swap back at bedtime. Strangely, they seem to forget some details but remember certain key ones which further the plot. In another instance, when Mitsuha, the girl protagonist (controlled by Taki, the male protagonist at the time), is trying to convince her father of something critical, she loses her temper and curses at him. It causes him to enter a state of temporary shock, saying ""Wait...you're someone else?"" The grandma briefly alluded to this happening before earlier in the movie to others. I guess body switching is just a common phenomenon in this universe, begging the question as to why so many don't believe it.
The characters are primarily centered on the two body swappers, Mitsuha and Taki, their two friends each respectively, and their small families. No one receives noteworthy development besides Mitsuha and Taki, but that's fine; remember, a movie has a more limited time frame. Mitsuha and Taki are mostly basic characters, both in design and personality, acting like typical teenagers- they worry about relationships, work, and their futures. Nothing particularly outstanding about any of that, but it doesn't necessarily need to be either. It may have even helped me appreciate them more than the typical ""lazy/strong/goofball/prodigy"" that is so common today with anime protagonists. It is also somewhat questionable that the two protagonists would become so obsessed with one another to the point of traveling around the country in search of the other, but I'll give that part mostly a pass; they're teenagers after all and don't know any better (were it happening to me, I'd immediately contact a psychiatrist). 
The animation is designed beautifully, but as aforementioned that is expected with a movie. The voice actors are fantastic, with each playing as the other gender while in their body nicely, and the score is often well enough. At times the soundtrack is used to to transition scenes, both at the beginning and end. For me this wasn't much of a problem, but I can understand it bothering some.
Despite the bumps in the road, Kimi no Na wa is enthralling enough for me to recommend not only to fans of the supernatural, but to everyone. The characters and story will move you with it's stunning presentation and stylish direction. It's certainly worthy of the ""newest edgy movie"" title.",8,duhu1148
32281,"
                In short, 'your name' is an overrated commercial movie.
Once Shinkai was asked, who would he wanna be if he can choose. He answered: a high school girl, because high school girls have everything. But still, with that in mind, I still felt the huge commercial success of 'your name' is at the cost of some real emotions. (for example, a much less known anime called Wandering Son does much better job at portraying transgender issues and 5cm/s does a much better job at portraying distance.) 'your name' does a decent job portraying karma, but if you dive into literature and movie there's just tons of
                  much better example (Cloud Altas, for example). So besides the novelty of body swapping and a decent explanation of karma, 'your name' is simply a relatively imaginative and very commercial animated love story. It does aligns with some of Jung's anima/animus theory, if you think bit more carefully so it's a pretty reasonable narrative, but there's nothing really superb about it.",7,happybunny561

                Kimi no Na Wa. I couldn't think of a better name for such a masterpiece. The breathtaking visuals, the compelling story, the touching music: all these combined formed the most amazing anime. 
In just an hour and a half of watch time, I was totally enveloped in the show. All of the characters, all of the settings, it felt as if I knew everyone and everything in the show for a long time. every minute I spent looking at each scene felt like a part of my memory which was erased without knowing.

                Break out the pitchforks and torches and send the angry mob to my house- I'm just going to come out and say right from the get go that this movie is- gulp- overrated. For those already triggered and offended, take a step back and realize that overrated is not the same as bad. I do not, by any means, think this is a bad film. I gave it an 8, which is a very good score. I just don't see this as an absolute slam dunk 10 out of 10 top 10 anime of all time masterpiece the way a large portion of the community
                  seems to. Let's get into it.
Art-
This anime is visually beautiful and extremely well animated. I have no qualms whatsoever with its visual presentation and there were absolutely a handful of shots where one could just pause the show, take in the beautiful scenery and just appreciate it from a purely artistically beautiful point of view. In my opinion the art and visual presentation is the overall strongest point of the show.
Sound-
The voice acting was pretty good but did not blow me away. No one had a performance that truly stood out to me as outstanding and sometimes Taki's voice in the dub seemed a bit off to me. Passable all around, but nothing special.
The soundtrack also didn't stand out to me as particularly mind blowing. Similar to the voice acting it was pretty good, no egregiously bad songs and each piece was individually GOOD, but nothing really went beyond GOOD to me. I was looking for that one EXCELLENT, blow me away, this is THE track of this anime kind of song and it just never came. This soundtrack, while perfectly respectable and pleasant, wouldn't come remotely close to my personal top 50 anime soundtracks of all time list.
Character/Story-
This is probably where my opinion varies the most from that of the general community and where people will be most upset and offended, but I really think the story is significantly overrated. I liked the base premise of the body switching, connected fates, caring about someone so much as to traverse time to keep them alive and stop a tragic disaster, etc. It's an intriguing concept that hasn't been done a million times before and it had a lot of potential.
The execution, however, felt very average to me. First and foremost, a story like this is supposed to be based around love and emotions and in order to be effective it has to really hit the viewer in the feels. For me it just didn't. I didn't find myself fighting back tears or feel my stomach really twisting at any point during this anime. I was cheering for both of the main characters for sure, but it just didn't have the emotional impact on me the way other anime such as Erased, Dusk Maiden of Amnesia and From The New World have in the past.
Additionally, I felt the story was rather shallow. I feel they could have gone further with it and done more with the concept. To me it lacked depth and there was some wasted potential in not taking a concept with all the potential in the world a bit further.
Finally, there were definitely some logic holes and conveniences that really detracted from my enjoyment. When in the original timeline 500 ish people died it is not realistic that in the new timeline, even with all the efforts of the characters to warn people and minimize the casualties of the disaster, that there would be 0 deaths. That's just way too happy happy and convenient and unrealistic. Realistically there would always be at least a handful of people who either did not get the warning (sleeping, in the shower, whatever) or simply chose not to heed the warning through either not believing it or just being lazy. The notion that all 500 people who otherwise would have been killed ALL heard and obeyed the warning and ALL went to the school on time is nonsensical and significantly detracted from the emotional impact of the story for me. I would have been much happier if the death count went from 500 to 75, which is much more believable, as opposed to from 500 to 0. Come on man...
Enjoyment-
I liked the movie, loved its visuals and generally appreciated what was, as a blanket statement, a high quality piece of art. BUT, all that said, I simply was not blown away. An all time very good to be sure, and worthy of being mentioned in discussions, but wildly overrated as an all time top 10. As of this writing it's ranked number 3 on this site and I could never, ever agree with that.
Overall-
A solid ride worth taking with a great concept and gorgeous visuals. The emotional impact is overstated and it's not nearly as deep as other anime out there, but it's still a good movie, albeit not an amazing one, that I'd recommend. Just get off the ""best anime ever"" hype train- that's too far.

                A highly overrated anime that's actually good and yet not as good as people make it sound like. Mostly, I ended up comparing it to Makoto Shinkai-senpai's previous works. However, unlike others, found a very different conclusion.
By Comparison:
Story: Not nearly as good as 5 Centimeters Per Second or Garden of Words.
Art: Not nearly as good as Garden of Words.
Sound: OK. Here, Kimi no Na wa wins. Best soundtrack yet.
Character: Not specifically interesting and not nearly as good as 5CPS.
Enjoyment: It's fun. And it leaves you happy unlike with 5CPS.
Overall: Makoto-senpai is right. There was a lot more work to be done on this.
On its own:
Story: The supernatural element, poorly explained in the anime, and a lot of apparent plotholes left behind by the anime leave the plot empty. A potentially good story idea messed up in the anime adaptation. The novel has most issues and plotholes covered unlike the anime.
Art: Pretty good really. Not god-level like in Garden of Words but still pretty awesome. Some shots look pretty damn good and the Tokyo city feels alive.
Sound: Put together the amazing songs by RADWIMP, the great soundtrack and the perfect placement of the right songs and you have a master-piece in sound.
Character: Taki is a normal school-kid and so is Mitsuki. The only thing interesting about this is how Taki was willing to cross his limits for someone he had not much knowledge of.
Enjoyment: There's a lot of fun moments in the movie and it leaves you happy at the end.

                WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILERS
Oh, look at this, another anime that is highly overrated because it's pretty colours. Let's see together what is supposed to make this movie special, popular and loved:
1. Beginning: The movie already started with a plot convenience with the body swap. It was never explained how it works, what are the possible consequences and how can be reversed. Also, this premise is used for a comic purpose instead of trying to explore how this affects the protagonists psychologically and, through this premise, they could even have increased their empathy thanks to the experience of the exchange of bodies. There were more
                  interesting ideas that could have been executed with this premise, although in the end they used it as a joke.
2. Characters: The protagonists are, basically, a comic relief during the first half. We know little to nothing about them beyond all the comedy they performed with them. In the second half, they were a failed attempt of time traveling superheroes. I'm not lying when I say that the characterization and/or backstory is nearly inexistent.
3. Time Traveling: This trope was used in the most retarded and convenient way possible. It is introduced because yes, it is never explained how it works, during the time traveling they always ended meeting each other, which is quite convenient. Why don't they end up on different timelines? How many days in time did they go back? Because they never said it during the movie, on any of the occasions.  Also, the amnesia for time traveling appears when it suits the script best. Even they met in spiritual form, wtf? That's how retarded this movie is. And what the protagonists did after they met during time travelings? Nothing that contributes to the plot, story or character development.
4. The second half: After the introduction of time traveling, our protagonists try to change a past event that could have killed thousands of people. And why did they do that? They never knew about this case in first place. And how did they planned to do it? This part happened behind the scenes, for real? The writers were lazy even for their biggest plot twist. At the end, the case was solved without any time paradox, even if this doesn't make sense. Talking to the last sentence, of in the original time line, the deaths never happened, so all this plot twist was a total nonsense.
5. Ending: After the solving of the case, later, they met each other and magically remembered everything that happened. What a great way to end this movie.
Conclusion: It was terrible in many levels, if I didn't rated lower was because the animation and production values.",3,RomanceEnjoyer48

                This movie was so cruel.. it starts off all bright and gives the impression that oh this is going to be a happy story where everyone lives happily ever, but nah lets just make this just entire thing switch lanes in just one scene. Don't get me wrong, if it didn't do that this movie probably wouldn't have been as good as it is right now. Here's why.
 I finished the movie today and i have to tell you,  I was so immersed into the movie always sitting on the edge of my chair just dying to know what happens next. This is partially,
                  because of how quick of a turn this movie took and how much it intensified almost to the point of it being overwhelming.  I think that was one of the reasons to why this movie is so great. 
I seldom write reviews but i just have to tell you, this is a straight masterpiece. This is a movie that is going to stay at the top of movie lists for a very long time and if you haven't watched it yet and you're reading this review debating whether or not you should go watch this movie. JUST DO IT!!!!!

                Literally known as THAT anime movie since recent months, and is still soaring in publicity.
My opinion of it was pretty positive after I first viewed it, and I was pretty happy with everything. But seeing its incredibly positive reception, and thinking more about what actually happened in the movie, my views slightly changed (just a bit). 
I really don't want to blame the hype for killing my favorable impressions, but it does make my eye twitch to see so many ""IT'S PERFECT ABSOLUTELY THE BEST"" comments that seem more like vague fawning, when actually there's a lot of room for critique. And for a movie
                  that's reached a level of popularity even Makoto Shinkai is uncomfortable with, I think critique is very much needed.
As a note, I've watched most of Shinkai's other works, including shorts and films. I'm familiar with his narrative and thematic preferences. Most directors have one - for example, Miyazaki includes the magic of nature and simple living in all his works, at times criticizing industrialization and violence as a means to an end. Shinkai makes works that revolve around the themes of distance, connection, and loss as it occurs in the physical, spatial, temporal sense. He has a poetic method to his narratives as well. While it's fine (great, even) to have style, I worry that his works will become increasingly one-note in nature and as a result, not as thrilling as ""Your Name"" is perceived to be.
Story (5/10):
Many pitfalls can arise when a complex narrative is forced to be squished into roughly 100 minutes of material. I believe Shinkai encounters the same problems. 
""Your Name"" is a complicated story with complicated concepts. ""Time travel"" already suggests leaps over logic and takes a while for one to wrap their mind around. The movie presses upon this theme with spiritual and poetic elements (along with a super meteor),  upping the chances of confusion. But, yes, perhaps one can push aside all the complications under the all-embracing heading of the ""fantasy"" genre.
The narrative development just seems rushed and flat at times. There's questions left unanswered as well. Sometimes things seem too convenient or too contrived. Moreover, as I realize now, there was so much opportunity for solutions to arise in the story but they just...weren't, leading to a fine mess that they desperately must struggle to fix. 
Yes, there are big plotholes that may have been lost under the guise of beautiful visuals and charming animation. I'm not impressed with the writing as it seems either lacking or too flowery. And just to state a bias, I do think there is a level of ""poeticism"" that Shinkai puts into all his works that just doesn't appeal to me. 
And ah yes, the romance - cute, but questionable, maybe a little random. I've noticed this in his other works as well but the romance is vague and fairly shallow. You can't really guess where all that attraction came from. The development wasn't fleshed out. It's not a huge complaint, but it is something I wondered about. 
5/10 for all the strange or contradictory plot devices, and a lacking / questionable narrative.
Art / Sound: 9/10
I didn't watch the movie at its best quality but even I know that the art was amazing. Shinkai does well in crafting environments and directing splendid animation. I do wish the storytelling could match the power of the visuals.
Music was good as well, but is now being overplayed to death.
Character: 5/10
After all these months, I still don't know how I feel about Taki or Mitsuha. Maybe if I rewatched the film, I might build a better connection, but as of now, I feel they are mediocre in terms of character design. 
I barely know much about them. I've seen their outward mannerisms but they don't suggest uniqueness. They seem rather trope-y, unremarkable, another set of typical anime high schoolers. Perhaps that was intended. I can take them as the ""hero"" and ""heroine"" but there's nothing else special. There wasn't enough development for them that made me want to walk their shoes.
Enjoyment: 7/10
For all its worth, the movie is beautiful. It truly is, and there were some fun moments. Overlooking all the script problems, you'll get a nice (not perfect) movie. I didn't strongly dislike any part, and the resolution was decent. It was a good time.
Last comments:
So, yes, I enjoyed watching ""Your Name"" but it does have flaws. It was fun to watch but not exactly fun to pick apart. I've picked apart Shinkai's other works, and I can copy and paste what I analyzed from them and apply them to ""Your Name"" with only some minor adjustments to account for the ""flair"" added to the story. And I guess that's where some of my disappointment is from. ""Your Name"" doesn't feel new from past Shinkai works, yet has reached a level of fame because it has flashy, stylized, cliche features abundant in regular, episodic anime. 
But, I do think there's merit in watching the movie, and I'm sure viewers will find many good things to say about it. However, I have to seriously disagree with those who talk about how fantastic the movie is without explaining any more than that. A movie that's reached this caliber deserves a much deeper appraisal and evaluation than a simple, unquestionable ""It's the best / it's perfect.""",6,ruhmi

                Story 6/10
Fairly simple story with ""twists"" that one could see from a mile away. At certain points the story was somewhat cringe-worthy and doesn't shine compared to the other anime we normally see. Aside from this romance, which is supposed to be a driving force in the story, is somewhat lacking due to the fact that it is so sudden and has no development whatsoever.
Art 6/10
The art was decent but not anything special, nor does it need to be with this type of anime, so I have no real complaints in this area.
Sound 8/10
Probably the highest scoring area for this movie, whilst the music doesn't
                  give you the chills like dragon force or tenka fubu, it fits well with the story and to a certain extent helps bring about emotions from the scene.
Character 6/10
Characters were alright, like a lot of anime they make the weirdest of decisions but the main problem was that we simply didn't see much in the change of behaviour of characters. Slightly disappointing.
Enjoyment 5/10
This is probably the only area where I am slightly biased, I've seen reviews and I've felt the hype for this movie, I was let down. As mentioned before there were a lot of cringe-worthy moments that also put a damper on the experience and so I probably enjoyed this less than someone who walked in and knew nothing of it nor what to expect.
Overall 7/10
I have to make it clear I don't believe that this movie deserves the hype it's been given, that was probably one of the reasons I was so disappointed when watching this. That being said the movie is by no means excruciating to watch and the basic idea behind the story is not too shabby so if you have time and you're able to just watch it with no expectations good on you, watch it, you'll probably enjoy this more than I did.",7,Yorozuya4eva

Kimi no na wa is a great exemple of what a good anime movie should be. The visual art is well done and the SFX are outstanding. One thing I liked a bit less is the soundtrack. Sometimes, the ST was not representing what was happening on screen. Also, I found it a tad boring, meaning that it looked too simple at times. However, most of it was okay to excellent. I liked how the characters did not take too long to understand what was going on. That was a good example of teamwork! Kimi no na wa has a rich story, great developement
                  and an insane plot twist. It was fun to watch, and if I can give you a suggestion: if you find yourself not understanding what is going on, be patient; everything will come to you in time. 
So to be clear, here are the Pros:
-Rich story/developement
-Great character design and behaviour
-Smooth, fancy, well drawn visual art
Cons: 
-Soundtrack is lacking coherence at times
-Story might be hard to understand right at the beginning. 
Great anime, 9/10 rating. Thanks for reading my review of Kimi no Na wa.

                Music is not a substitute for exposition.
This movie makes the same mistakes 5 Centimeters Per Second did in it's assumption that music can replace or expedite time set apart to develop characters and establish conflict or a climax. By this, I refer to the director's decision to insert loud, obnoxious songs over montages which skim through key, plot progressing events or moments which could provide insight to Taki and Mitsuha's character; scenes which show who they are as people. Not enough time was dedicated to expanding upon their personalities and as a result, I was apathetic towards anything they characters went through. The lack of
                  character exposition affected me in that I could not feel a connection to either Taki or Mitsuha. And it's a sad shame because with two protagonists, a viewer should at least be able to identify with one. Thus is the consequence when a director neglects to develop his characters and spends too much time on art and sound; two factors of a film which matter significantly less than characters and story. 
There's a film hierarchy, and here's how it goes:
Story - The meat of the film; the reason the film exists in the first place. Filmmakers are nothing more than storytellers. If the story is not captivating or interesting, the audience won't enjoy the movie.
Characters - These are the actors. The characters are what draw you into the film. When you can relate to a character and envision yourself in their shoes, that is when the Suspension of Disbelief occurs; the moment where you forget you're even watching a film. The characters have to be more than interesting. They must be human. They need flaws and they need strengths to balance them. They must have desires and the ambition to pursue them throughout the film. Multi-faceted characters bring the story to life.
Sound - You can't enjoy a film you cannot hear. This makes sound design very important. A soundtrack can make or break a film. The music must accentuate the scene, not overpower it. The volume and quality of sound effects and character voices all ties into this as well.
Art - Finally, the art or cinematography. It should not be an after thought, but it should not be so important that the aforementioned elements suffer. The way a movie looks affects how the scene is perceived; brighter colors in contrast to dark hues determine the mood or tone of the film. Art is another way to draw a person into the world of the movie but it cannot replace a good story, three dimensional characters, or effective dialogue.
Unfortunately for Kimi no Na Wa, despite it's brilliant and unique story, vivid scenery and colors, and the orchestral soundtrack, the characters lack enough personality to collapse the whole film upon itself. What's worse; by the end, there's very little development. As a matter of fact, by the end it's almost as if the character's have less personality than what they started with. This is a direct consequence of the director's choice to insert a MUSIC VIDEO (AGAIN) in the last 5 minutes of his film. The same mistake he did in 5 Centimeters Per Second. Every second is precious in a film and in those 5 minutes he could have shown a new side of their personal lives, how they were emotionally affected by the events 5 years ago, and how they'd grown as people from the beginning into the people they were now. Any subtle differences to demonstrate that change. It doesn't always have to be something dramatic. Every little detail in a film is supposed to give insight into the real nature of the characters. Instead, every detail in this film pointed towards the high visual budget he had and provided a visually stimulating experience in opposition to an emotionally stimulating one. Because after all, it's hard to feel moved by characters you know next to nothing about.

                Now, ""Kimi no Na wa."" (Your Name.) has received its fair share of criticism as the number one highest-grossing anime film of all time. Many such criticisms include an illogical plot, shallow characters, deus ex machina - all of which are completely understandable. When taking a look at this film solely from a critical and objective perspective, it will not live up to its expectations. However, in this review, I intend to delve into why this film captured the hearts of so many, why it caught mine, and why I believe it is justified to have done so.
> Keep in mind, this review contains minor
                  spoilers! <
Starting with the plot, many have criticized its convolutions, its use of deus ex machina, and its overall absurdity. As the whole film is essentially a flashback to 5 years prior, the events that take place embody its primary theme, which I will do my best to explain:
Have you ever had a feeling that you have long searched for something, even though you don't know what it is? This ""something"" could be a destination, an object, a phenomenon, an occupation, or even someone else in the film's case - but anything really. I believe that this feeling can be related with most, if not all people. That feeling of longing or yearning to be satisfied, but you don't exactly know how to go about doing it.
Most of us have spent years of our lives being with who we are with as of now, but some of us lose our path along the way there. This film essentially breaks down that stray - the stray from passion and commitment despite initial resistance, and for whatever reason it may be. However, when the time comes and that same passion is revitalized once again, hypothetically speaking, you'd probably experience this strange ""sensation"": you'd wonder how and why you strayed from that path in the first place, you'd create an excuse, and then you'd believe it, however unreasonable of an excuse it may be.
From my understanding, the illogical nature of the plot reflects the illogical nature of that exact ""sensation"". In the film's case, you don't know why you are so connected with this individual, why they are so familiar to you, why you feel as if you've been searching for them your whole life, and what exactly is the convoluted reasoning behind it. You just...are. It doesn't matter what the reasoning behind it is - you can make one up, whether it's logical or not. When that lost passion for one another is reignited and you finally come together, it just feels...right, and nothing else matters for while.
One other reason as to why I believe this film connected with so many is due to that feeling of final and overwhelming satisfaction. That long searched for idea has finally come to life, and it's right in front of you. The satisfaction that is yearned for by so many, only to get a glimpse of it during the film's conclusion with a purposeful cut-off.
All in all, I feel as if there's a reason behind its convoluted plot. That there's a reason behind its shallow characters. That there's a reason to its cut-off conclusion. As well, there's probably a reason as to why the main character's names were never mentioned again in the film after returning to present day, just like there's a reason as to why I didn't use their names at all in this review and instead used ""you"". I believe it's representative of that commonly felt ""sensation"". That anyone can go through this - anyone can revitalize that old sense of passion once lost for something or someone and reach that point of ultimate satisfaction. You'll just have to remember what that passion was and what it was like, or in this case, all you need is to remember their name.
> Final Thoughts <
Never have I had a film, or anything really, connect with me so deeply on an emotional and personal level. After watching, I couldn't think of anything else for a few hours. Just that longed for feeling of satisfaction waiting to be reached, and it's just a matter of who, what, when, where, why, and how.
This film transcends the barriers of logical reasoning in favour of something much more...magical. What lies on the surface, the limit of critical observance, isn't all of which it has to offer. It succeeds as an engrossing visceral experience. It speaks deeper than the absolute beauty of its visuals, deeper than the voice of its ethereal and carefree melodies, deeper than the initial appearance of its overlying absurdity - deeper, speaking to heart rather than mind.
I think of this film as a masterpiece, not because I believe it is objectively flawless - it isn't, but rather because I believe it is a perfect representation of this ""sensation"". No matter how absurd the plot may have been, what mattered to many of those who watched this film was that these two characters would finally find each other and meet once again. No more attention would be paid to the reasoning behind it - just the satisfaction of its conclusion and discovery. Just the passion that was found and sparked once more. That's all that really mattered.",10,kirk_E

                Have you ever watched a Cristopher Nolan movie? This is what you'll find with Kimi no Na Wa. A beautiful, but, yet empty movie, which hides how dreadful it is overall behind the fact that it's so beautiful.
The character development is inexistent, as with all Makoto Shinkai works, so as the reasoning of them, that should be the thing that drives the plot forward.
You can't actually relate with the characters, since the astonishing environment makes you think they're not having any issues at all.
Unless you're in a web-relationship and REALLY needs this to make a statement for you ""lover"", this is not for you.

                Kimi no Na wa is a movie not just for the anime-lovers among us, but for any odd soul out there. I'm fairly inexperienced when it comes to Makoto Shinkai's work, but if this is any benchmark as to what to expect from him, consider me sold. Just like the love it portrays, I can see this movie withstanding the test of time to be loved and enjoyed by viewers generations apart.
Kimi no Na wa is a story about a love separated by time, and tragedy. Our characters dream about living life in a different body, but soon enough, they realize that it isn't all
                  just a dream, it is reality. Over the course of this body-sharing experience, they come to learn about each others' lives, and begin to realize some of their own truest yearnings. Until the body-sharing mysteriously stops, memories are wiped, and they're left to discover what happened with nothing to guide them but a mysterious longing within their hearts.
The animation quality greatly benefits from modern day technology, as it is, well, breathtaking at times. I am, simply, thankful to be living in a day and age when art and animation can come together so perfectly to create an experience like this. Taki and Mitsuha come to life through the voices of their outstanding voice artists (Kamiki and Kamishiraishi), to the point where it's utterly believeable that they are living their characters. The music accompanies the drama beautifully as it lifts your spirits and tugs at your heartstrings in tune with what you're witnessing before your eyes. I rarely get so engrossed in movie, but I found my heart in my mouth quite often indeed.
It's such a delightful movie to watch, and I can't help but give this my highest recommendation. I'll definitely be rewatching this... which reminds me; my only disappointment about Kimi no Na wa, is that I can never watch it again for the first time. Cheers!",9,kidae

                Typical story of Makoto Shinkai
From the synopsis alone, you can tell that Kimi no Na wa Makoto Shinkai presenting typical story about a pair of young men and women that are difficult to meet. Kimi no Na wa tells Taki living in Tokyo and Mitsuha who lived in a village. When asleep, their bodies were both confused. This makes their life became chaotic as different behavior when exchanging body. Therefore, they both promised to take down all activities in order to maintain their lives.
Wherever possible I do not want to give spoilers so you can watch it with satisfaction. In terms of duration, the film
                  is quite long that lasted 1 hour 46 minutes. Duration is longer than Kumo no Mukou, Yakusoku no Basho and shorter than Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo. Even so, Makoto Shinkai seems to have learned from the films that he did before. Despite the long duration, pacing is much better this time so as to make the audience does not get bored.
Although this time duration is long enough, Shinkai using all their time efficiently to make you closer to Taki and Mitsuha. The story was submitted from each side of the character, so you know how life around each main character and how to exchange the body begins to affect their daily lives.
Thanks to this, Kimi no Na wa really bring a better story for Shinkai spend more time on the second main character so that the audience became more concerned with the fate of both of them, and wondered how the two of them at the end of this movie.
Handling character and pacing better story makes Kimi no Na wa become better than films previously Shinkai. Shinkai's works of the best known is the Hoshi no Koe, Byousoku 5 cm, and Kotonoha no Niwa. All three are more successful because of the shorter duration that are commonly handled by Shinkai. As for Kumo no Mukou, Yakusoku no Basho and Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo less well-known. I think personally, the problem is in both films is the use of a less efficient way to make us care about the characters.
Quality Animation Unnecessary Doubtful
In addition to the story that makes you upset, anime is done by Makoto Shinkai is always an eye-candy. Of course Kimi no Na wa presents a very beautiful animation. Although the theme this time not rain like in Kotonoha no Niwa, Kimi no Na wa still bring rain scene is amazing. Character movement is very smooth, especially during a scene related to Mitsuha and village.
Despite presenting beautiful animation, image details are not forgotten. Each scene is clearly visible and you can identify all objects with ease. In fact, at the time at the end of his movie, my friends who come to watch know the area that he was near his office in Japan.

I can't write a review for it as the movie transcends my linear way of thinking and forces me to come to terms with forms and concepts of love that i never even took notice of.
Storytelling in its root hints at a fundamental human unease, hints at human imperfection. Where there is perfection there is no story to tell. 
Of course there were minute flaws in the movie but those flaws are the very thing that seem to be the

SUMMARY: In short, this anime is something worth watching, but misses that extra edge to make it a masterpiece. 
It's cute, the idea is interesting, the animation is solid, but none of it appears to stand out in any way that would make it a timeless masterpiece. Again, its not like Kimi no Na wa was bad, it just wasn't a masterpiece. 
I think Kimi no Na wa embodies a lot of the fear I have for the future of anime. Unlike the films of older generations, such as Akira, Spirited Away, and Ghost in the Shell, the works of today appear to have lost the unique edge and power that was once vibrant in the anime industry. In terms of what that edge is, exactly, the jury is still out. 
But one thing is for certain, it appears that the old-school methods are being put aside for the new format which Kimi no Na wa embodies: High Color Contrast, Hip Character Design, and Melodramatic plots. Everything is based on reality, but doesn't truly feel real. 
Does this mean Kimi no Na wa isn't worth your time? I wouldn't say that, it's a fun little drama piece that's worth watching. But I also wouldn't count it as a masterpiece.",8,adamjgilbert

                Kimi no na wa is a very good movie, infact one of the bests I have seen so far. 
Story, visuals, characters, sounds .. everything is very good. It is that type of movie which stays in your head a long time after you have watched it, .. and you may be tempted to watch it again. 
I myself, am not that kind of person who watches a movie/tv series twice but here I really want to watch it and will watch it again sometime soon. 
As noted earlier, the movie was great and all, I just want to highlight a couple of points I
                  think were missing in the movie.
1. The part where characters get to know each other's life, that part goes off too quickly using a song in the background. That was one of the most beautiful moments of this movie and it had me genuinely smiling. So I would have liked if that part could have been exteneded a bit more, maybe 10-20 mins more. 
2. In the end, I would have liked to hear the thoughts of Mitsuha as well about the incidents that occurred 8 years ago. We only get to know the viewpoint of Taki. Learning her viewpoints would have been a much more complete experience IMO. 
Kimi no na wa is that good a movie that I will like that the producer does a re-make of the movie fixing the points mentioned above. Surely, the movie will get a bit long but I don't care. Watching a good 2.5 hr movie is nothing but pleasure. 
PS - Seeing the storyline, I guess it could have been made into a 12-episode anime series. That would have been better.",10,aviaryan
32281,"
                Kimi no Na wa is an ambitious slice of life anime packed into a marvelous movie-length bite. It is hard to believe how much character development was actually achieved and how impeccably it was done. This development was achieved, as most great character development is done: not through mindless narration but by putting the characters in particular scenarios, watching their interactions with other characters and environments, and with each other; meaning, that you're utterly bombarded with character development through the entire movie, whether you notice it or not. Every little action and reaction, every decision, every scene is specifically tailored to show you as much
                  of the characters as possible. This is the more impressive considering how ambitious of a premise the movie has and how much plot there is to tell. And, it somehow does all of it with time to spare. The story told in the anime is full of emotional plot twists that are sure to get your heart racing, just ignore the massive plot holes everywhere.

                Alright so I'm just going to get straight to the point. Makoto Shinkai, sound familiar? Maybe 5cm per second, Garden of words or Voice of a distant star... Well one things for sure, Shinkai has yet to disappoint us, when coming to beautiful animation and that saying ""Kimi no Na wa,"" english translation ""Your Name"" is another one of his most beautiful masterpieces. 
*I'll try to make this as spoiler free as possible*
EXTENDED SUMMARY: 
Shinkai manages to produce films which are realistic, emotionally provoking and deep. Your Name follows a similar kind of format, a romance/high school/slice of life anime in which our two main
                  protagonist Mitsuha and Taki, highschoolers who live very different lives. Mitsuha being in the country side with old traditions following her, not to her liking and Taki who she wishes to be because he lives in Japan's capital city Tokyo, where things are much more exciting. One day they suddenly switch places, making it a bit of a gender blender genre and get to experience each others lives, in each others bodies. It's the little things Shinkai incorporates in his films that make it so great and the little sparks of humor every so often. You would think what could possibly go wrong, swapping between bodies of the opposite gender but Shinkai surprises us with a plot twist that no one was expecting, a very complicated, painful and sad one at that. One that will leave you thinking, time is precious and happy moments don't last forever. 
FIRST HAND THOUGHTS:
So I first found Kimi no Na wa in anime form, I think it was when watching a trailer. The moment I saw that this was by Makoto Shinkai, I knew that I had to give it a shot. I was one of his fans when I first borrowed 5cm per second from my local library and have yet to forget the feels since, So, if you've ever watched 5cm per second and enjoyed it then Kimi no Na wa is the one for you. OR, if you enjoy watching beautiful landscapes with high quality animation this film will not dissapoint you.
WHEN WATCHING:
I've watched this twice now, so for the second time watching there weren't many surprises. The first time watching Your Name will be a little confusing especially towards the second part of the film and I believe Shinkai does this because he wants us to know that life is not meant to be easy, it's meant to be a roller coaster, that goes up and down. Furthermore, Taki and Mitsuha's relationship, if you could call it that was not a direct one. Have you ever been in a relationship whom you've never met the person, nor have gotten to know them before but the only thing you know about them is the people and surroundings they associate with? Well that's the kind of thing Taki and Mitsuha have going on and because of that when Taki is spontaneously switching bodies with Mitsuha and vice versa, it brings about all kinds of awkward situations. Despite all that, there are stages in Kimi no Na wa when you're thinking ""no, no, no,"" and that's what makes it so great. The animation melts my eyes as every scene is done is beautifully as if I were watching video being filmed. The music fits well with the story and I have no complaints about the voice acting. 
AFTER THOUGHTS:
The film demonstrates to us how easily we can be attached to someone else, even if it was through a short period of time. The film is about strong bonds I realised and persistence when coming to achieving something. It is about fighting against all odds in hope for finding memories that were once lost. What makes us connected are memories, and Kimi no Na wa empathises to us the importance of memory and how easily one can be forgotten. Your Name sends a strong message for us all, don't stop fighting for the things you believe in, even when you're not sure whether what you believe in makes any sense at all, because it's okay to follow what your heart says(that's kind of cheesy).This is because when you don't give up you're creating chances that would have never existed and memories and experiences that would have never been created if you had given up from the start. 
WHAT IT LACKED?
There isn't much Kimi no Na wa lacked to be honest but I'de also understand why it might not be everyones cup of tea. The storyline may be a bit confusing for some because of the switch between characters and also the lack of romantic interaction. But that's because the film is more than just love, but it explores what makes up love; the strong connections, the memories and interactions that make the film so raw with emotion.
CONCLUSION: 
Overall, Kimi no Na wa is a film for viewers who prefer something more of a subtle romance that explores more about us as people. How strong an individual can be when persisting and yes as boring as it sounds life lessons. But despite that I did enjoy the film, it's always nice to have something beautiful yet doesn't lack in in depth storyline and relatable characters. Shinkai yet again taking the ordinary and making it extraordinary(that was pretty bad wasn't it).

                This movie is bomb. 
To begin, the art is breathtaking and next-level. The music in and of itself is not amazing, but paired with the film it works perfectly. And now the storyline:
The whole idea of ""switching places"" is unique, innovative, and perfect for a love story. The fact that Taki and Mitsuha have never met in person but learn to understand one another through seeing how they behave in each other's bodies makes for a beautiful romance. As characters, Taki and Mitsuha are not super unique but I think this only adds to the movie because it makes the story more universally understood so
                  anyone can relate and feel like they are in the shoes of one of our protagonists. 
Time and religion are brilliantly used in this film. One of my favorite quotes in the movie is when Mitsuha's grandma is talking about how braided cords represent the flow of time (Musubi) and how they ""twist, tangle, sometimes unravel, break, and then connect again"". In addition to representing Taki and Mitsuha, this can be applied to so many real-world relationships, since people tend to lose touch for various reasons and then reconnect later in life. 
Highly, highly, highly recommend.

                2 Hours ago I watched a Silent Voice. I was craving for movies like that so I watched Kimi no na wa. Best decision I have ever made. This movie contains so many components and was made with passion.
Story - This movies story's/plot is something to envied. The story between two people switch bodies and experience each others contrasting lives and surrounding, while falling in love. But no the story doesn't end there - these dreams are from a dead girl who he met once and must now help to save her which inevitably allows them to meet once again.
The story is so unique and
                  amazing and is a movie of a generation.
Art - This movie and its animation style was amazing the pictures and all of the directions it took allowed a visually stunning movie which watching it in subbed made for a breath-taking experience. Truly a masterpiece. 
Sound - The thing that makes soundtracks and music in movies well is not that you notice is but that you feel it that the emotions are linked to sound and I believe that that Kimi no na wa was able to do this. The music compliments each scene and every emotion that takes place is smoothly mixed in. I might even buy the soundtrack.
Character - For this movie to work so well it needed the character development to be on point. In the movie you have two character witch two contrasting lives and location with one ambition which was there were missing something - each other. As the plot moves forward you can see that they both start to understand each other as the are closer than anything - viewing his or hers life from another's point of view. This leads them to search for each other in there quest to search for whats missing.
Enjoyment - My first thoughts on the movie was it was going to be a simple love story which the twist being that they could switch bodies but to my surprise the story was merely starting and the way it all links together from start to end just enforces how time and passion was taken in, mixed and created a masterpiece.
Overall - 10/10 - I would recommend this movie to anyone and I believe that people should watch this it its natural format as you will get the full experience of this breathtaking story.",10,TDiamondBro

                I cannot figure out why this movie is so popular and rated so highly.
Don't get me wrong, it is a solid movie. It's engaging, interesting and entertaining. But it also falls a bit flat when it comes to depth. Like I get that it does have a message and all but it feels rushed (my feeling is it would have fared better as an anime series) and the characters are severely underdeveloped. It's good, but nothing special. The animation is beautiful (though I am not a big fan of the character design, especially for Taki) and the soundtrack is not bad, but this is rated
                  higher than Mononoke Hime and I am baffled by that.
The connection between the main characters was severely lacking, due to the characters being underdeveloped and their interaction being nearly nonexistent. All the things that I found extremely interesting, like the idea of them influencing and perhaps improving the other's life and relationship with family and friends from inside of the other's body were just squeezed into a few shorts scenes. 
To sum it up, I feel like the idea was wasted on a spectacle involving a comet. I find that part unnecessary and extremely time consuming, which means not enough scenes for, say character development. 
All that said, my favourite scene would have to be the one where Taki goes hiking to the shrine with the little sister and grandma. I think it was beautifully done, and the strongest scene in the movie if you ask me. I wish the rest of the movie had the same feeling.
Spoiler ahead:
Also it bothered me so much that neither of the two figured out that they were in the wrong year when they switched bodies.",7,flamingo-cupcake

                Definitely a 2017 Oscar candidate, though pretty sure would lose to Moana. Though one thing I would assure you, Moana and other Hollywood made animations maybe are more superior on quality. But Anime will always win when it comes to storyline.
Story: reading the synopsis, i honestly thought this would be a body swapping, gender swapping comedy. I didn't really anticipate the tragedy and plot twist, and it really bugged me since I was hoping for a comedy genre. That's why I gave this anime a 10 on its storyline, for the unanticipated plot twist that quickly turned comedy, to drama, to romance, to tragedy, to
                  supernatural, then back again to comedy, and to romance. 
Art: The best part of this anime if you're talking about its art ofcourse the landscape. The detail of the shrine and the mountain is amazing.
Sound: Perfect for JPop lovers and I'm not one of them so I don't really care about the music.
Overall: A must see. Non Ghibli masterpiece and would definitely be a classic.",8,lunagothejc

                You know, i'm always a fan of struggle-together-romance... not just everyday-worrying-whether-i-will-met-her-tomorrow-or-not. and that's why like of spice and wolf, is my all-time favorite. Kimi no Na Wa is no exception, you can clearly see how they are try their hardest. 
Kimi no Na Wa also taught me many beautiful things in life, and funnily, answers my childhood question as well ""how does it feels when my soul was swapped to another's body?"" so that's another point entirely for me. 
the only problem in this movie is the character development, mostly because the limited screening time. I think there's still much things to explore between Taki
                  and Mitsuha's personality.
It will be better, imo, if Kimi no Na Wa were splitted to two or more episode, though i doubt that it will gains the same popularity as it is now.",10,Roo-loves-Elsie

                So it's been a while since I wrote a review for an anime and this is my first review for an anime movie, So bear with me for a short time. 
First, off let me start off with the ratings I have given for this movie 
Story:- 9 
Art :- 10
Sound:- 10 
Character:- 10 
Enjoyement:- 10 
Overall:- 10 
When this movie was released I was so eager to watch this as soon as possible even if it meant me getting my lazy butt off the chair and going to a cinema. But unfortunately where I live at the moment didn't get this movie in the cinema. So then I was like depressed for a long time. And a few days back I found the movie on an alternate site uploaded at 720p and I was so surprised that I thought it must have been a fake, but when I checked it, I found it to be true, So I immediately downloaded it from the site to watch it. 
This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen a long time, the movie earned 50 Million Yen + and is still earning even as I write this. So why is this movie so great that it had actually earned this much of an amount of money? I Will keep all descriptions short cause I don't want to go spoiling the movie for all of you. the first thing is the story, at first you would be confused on what the hell is happening but eventually you will get to understand that a girl from a village has switched bodies with a boy in Japan and it happen's every few days in a week and so the movie's first part focuses on how they spend their lives on their new bodies, The next portion of the movie is the most interesting but if I were to explain that certain part it would be giving out the entire story away. So I recommend you watching the movie for that, and mark my words the story is worth watching. 
The art and sound of the movie are absolutely fantastic. I am a person who usually watched either 720p or 1080p BD Rips and this I can say has one of the best CG Designs ever, the sound and voicing of the characters are no different either, the effects and mood created bu the sounds are in-replaceable by anything else.  From the poster art the moment I saw it, I knew that this movie is going to be a good one and it sure was a great one.  The Characters of the story are evenly balanced and I actually like that, the personality of the boy and the personality of the girl and also the side characters have been given a lot of thought and this is another factor which makes the movie so great. 
As par my promise I meant to keep this short, I will be ending the review here, i would recommend everyone to go and watch this movie in your cinema's if it is released or if not go to an anime site and watch the movie, and make sure to definitely buy a BD Copy of the movie once it comes out, because this is really worth buying, and I guarantee you that you will not regret spending 1 and a half hour watching this movie

Type of Review: Personal Opinion
POV: ""I"" Perspective
Disclaimer: This review is biased. I am not a fan of animated movies making the top ten and due to statistics, I watched with high expectations only to be disappointed in the end.
Art and Sound, like others have mentioned, is superb. No need to comment any further. With that out of the way,
Overall this anime is a mix of Kokoro Connect, 5 Centimeters per second (Good ending), and Charlotte. 
Ranked it 7 because I personally did not cry in the anime unlike in Charlotte and Kokoro Connect. However, I think this anime is better than 5 cm
                  per second in terms of character relationship.
Not enough tragedy and character development(Rushed) to make the good ending feel impactful.
Did not provide any intellectual stimulation and I was easily able to understand the story completely.",7,Generalsurvival
32281,"
                I have just finished watching it. 
I had to take a breather before writing this review.
I'll try not to spoil anything, and be as laconic as I could without sacrificing my views on the movie itself.
Okay, here goes.
The theme of the story has been done before on other mediums, but I can certainly say(having watched countless movies/anime sharing similar theme) that they managed to made it their own. The story started as what one would expect after reading the synopsis, but then it twists and turns into a heartwarming story about love and fate. The inclusion of cultural aspects into the plot is really refreshing.
                  
The visual was presented beautifully using colours to give nuances which helps the narrative. Soundtrack-wise it was really enchanting because they intertwined with the scene harmoniously. 
Information about the characters was not shown in expositional narrative, meaning I have to infer how the characters feel about other characters from the scenes shown which is something that I find pleasant and is usually missing nowadays. The characters themselves are quite charming, but due to how the story was told their development was not that visible, but I think for movies choosing to go this way is not bad. 
Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed it and didn't find a boring moment in it. The movie itself was around 90 minutes long I think, but it felt like 30 because I was really enthralled by the journey.
tl;dr
I'm a twenty something guy, and at the end I came close to crying. 
It's that good.

	Makoto Shinkai, a well known author and movie director in Japan, is famous for his tragic romance stories.  Your Name, Shinkai’s newest hit, revolves around the tragedy of losing and finding love.  A true rollercoaster of emotional events and romance comedy, Your Name is definitely worth watching.
“I feel like I’m always searching for something, for someone. This feeling has possessed me I think, from that day...”  We are all too familiar with this universal type of feeling of “missing” or “losing” someone.  This sort of displacement goes through the movie's, Your Name’s, two main characters minds continuously.  The feeling of
                  being somewhat “empty” is impressed upon them both.
	Your Name revolves around the two characters, Taki and Mitsuha, who have the uncontrollable problem of switching bodies with each other once they fall asleep.  The story begins with Mitsuha describing her hometown, Itomori, and her antagonism towards it.  She makes a wish at Itomori’s famous shrine to become a “handsome highschool boy in Tokyo” for her next life.  The next day, she wakes up in an unfamiliar apartment.  Examining the room, she walks up to a mirror and is shocked at her reflection.  She notices she’s not herself, but a male stranger named Taki Tachibana.  She continues the day in Taki’s body, thinking it’s a dream.  After enjoying her day in Tokyo, she falls asleep back in Taki’s apartment.  Afterwards, the real Taki wakes up in Mitsuha’s room and goes through the same experience in reverse.  Subsequently, Mitsuha awakes in her own house with only vague memories of the past day.  During class, Mitsuha flips through her notebook and realizes there was a note that said “Who in the world are you?”  Confused, she writes her name down beside the note.  From there on, Your Name unravels into something incredibly unforeseen.  
	Your Name's POV gives a great view of both character’s feelings and perspectives.  Even though it doesn’t affect the story in particular, Shinkai always tries to avoid potential narrative cliches and pitfalls, such as the overdone “boy vs girl”.  Shinkai portrayed the gender differences in a way that didn’t take away their personalities and values.  Although Shinkai tries to avoid cliches, the “lovers separated by time and distance” theme is used throughout the story.  Even though this idea is a bit overused, it is a very important factor which makes Your Name so enjoyable.  
Makoto Shinkai’s number one hit, Your Name, turned out to be another work of art, winner of four prestigious awards.  To say that Your Name is just another animation would be an extreme understatement. Shinkai has both an eye for detail and a poetic vision. The setting of Your Name feels both realistic and mystical at the same time. 
Your Name is a perfect movie for watchers who enjoy slice of life, romance-comedy, and a thrilling plot.  I would personally recommend this movie to almost anyone.  Out of all of Makoto Shinkai’s work, Your Name is a definite favorite amongst most watchers.  Overall, Your Name is a must watch.",9,happyclover

                A few months ago a person told me that movie credits are for the viewer to continue to sit in the chair and watch as he thinks and reflects on everything he has just seen. I agreed with that.
After watched this movie, I was more than certain of that. I kept the whole credits, reminiscing, thinking and reflecting on the incredible feeling I had during this journey. There are no words to describe this exciting story.
Throughout the small events and details, I had thought I had easily deduced what would happen. ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯ Maybe it's just my deduction skills that
                  are not so good but my deductions were almost all wrong, every moment that the film unfolded, I was surprised in an extremely positive way. It was simply a unique and totally fun feeling to see each of the 2 characters living the other's life.
I like the way the story unfolds sounds very realistic since the characters face enough difficulties that are not solved by script convenience. Not to mention the extraordinarily beautiful animation. You could pause at any time and take a screenshot that would give a great wallpaper. The relationship of the two characters and their eternal searches for answers and encounters is simply beautiful.
It is a totally unique and memorable experience and at the same time leaves me somewhat sad and emotional since I can never experience it again as if it were the first time",10,PhilippYuri

                Well, this was a movie that pop out of nowhere for me, since i don't really like notice these news... But it's popularity has surprised me, therefore I decided to give it a shot.
Well, the story, it's not disappointing, but not really that surprising either. It's not generic, at all, it's direction is rather unique. The problem it has to me is that, I kind of can guess what will happen, the twists aren't too surprising either.  Of course, I can't come up with such a story myself either, but as a viewer, the story is... at best good.
Characters, How should i put it.
                  They are interesting, how they interact with each other is also fun to watch. My problem here is, it's a bit inconsistent. Well, it's nothing critical, but how they behave at first and closing just feels different to me. Both are interesting, but I would also like to see they developing. Another thing that annoys me is the amnesia, it irritates me, but that's my personal problem. 
Art and Music: Both fits into the theme, and enjoyable
Enjoyment: First, this is not my favorite type of anime, but it gave me a good time. Nothing is really bad here, just somehow doesn't fit my taste. I would recommend people trying it out.

                This was my first time watching an anime movie, and I was very careful to choose a good one. Turns out, I picked the best I ever could. I'll try my best to keep this review as spoiler free as possible.
Story 9/10
I really loved the story, it was wonderful. Putting it into words is a little tough, but here goes. I loved the concept of the movie, as it plays around very well with emotions and is seems so chill and smooth going. The way the story progresses actually makes sense and there are no odd breaks in between where the viewer has no idea
                  what happened. At some points it gets a wee bit hard to follow and you don't exactly understand why something happened, but it all ties up perfectly in the end. 
Art 12/10
Never have I ever seen an anime with such detail and precision. The environment, sky shots, comet images, scenery art all is absolutely perfect. When there are no characters in the scene, it looks almost as if captured from a camera in today's world. 
Sound 10/10
I don't have much to say on this part, but the sounds of water and strings, were extremely calm and satisfying, not a shoddy job at all.
Character 9/10
I related very well to all these characters and it was very easy to imagine them being people I know, or would talk to. I found the character development, the friendship, the bond and all such factors depicted to beautifully, it was hard to imagine it being 2D or fake. They seemed very realistic.
Enjoyment/Overall 15/10
I wish I could go beyond that a 10/10 rating, but sadly that's not the case. To conclude the review I really enjoyed this. It plays with your emotions, your mind and juggles you around perfectly. I've never actually cried in any anime before this one. Very few scenes actually move me, and this movie definitely managed to give me the chill and tears 99% of the time. 
I would recommend this any day, any time, at any moment and to anyone. It is almost perfect in all aspects.

                Just came back from viewing Kimi no Na wa at the local movie festival in my town. 
Makoto Shinkai has really come far with this movie. The story has some semblance from other anime stories about body swapping their minds and bodies, but something more greater lies beneath this story.
As for art is Shinkai as always great at making it visually great for the eyes.
Characters from the movie are made me both laugh and cry at their various problems they faced.
The soundtrack is one of the great gems of the year from the RADWIMPS with ending song ""Nandemonaiya"" filled with emotion, but other tracks are
                  well suited for the various scenes in the movie. I really did enjoy watching this movie at my local theater and i hope to watch once more.
Overall:
The movie did tug at my heartstrings, but Shinkai did reach new heights with Kimi no Na wa.",9,nobunaga

                Well if you guys want to rate this movie, just keep one thing in mind if you give it a 10 it would be the same as one of your favourite anime, so just compare it with your favourite anime, well story was a  bit ordinary, but the art was very good + sound effects, characters could be more interesting and at the end it is a beautiful anime...
We can say one of the best anime in recent times...

                The story of two individuals overcoming the obstacles that lay between them. This film is actually a very simple concept and doesn't take long to explain. But that's what makes this film good is the simplicity done well and uniquely executed. Kimi no Na wa features the two main characters Taki and Mitsuha who learn of each others existence when one day they mysteriously have switch bodies. Taki and Mitsuha have never met before and they live to two very different places, and such it is that they live different lives with their own problems. Being forced to live someone else's life for a full
                  day every other day, the two of them communicate through notes and diaries and come to learn more about each other by literally living in each other's shoes. However, though they may be connect through tied thread of fate many obstacles lie between them and each of them must fight their own battles to overcome the one thing they search for.
Shinkai Makoto is a name I came across recently when I watched the short show ""Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko: Everything Flows"" in which Shinkai was the director. The interesting vision and storytelling behind that show very much intrigued me as it was fairly unique and surprisingly effective in telling a story entirely through the eyes of a cat. It later came as a surprise to me that the new dominating hit in Japanese theaters this summer that outdid even Shin Godzilla was also directed by Shinkai. It seems that Kimi no Na wa was not only Shinkai's magnum opus but also skyrocketed his popularity and now almost all of his works are available on Netflix which I highly recommend you check out: Garden of Words (Koto no ha no Niwa), Children who Chase Lost Voices (Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo), and 5 Centimeters Per Second (Byousoku 5 centimeter). While his other works and fairly well known, have emotional depth and character, and have a marveling visual direction and animation, these works do tend to suffer here and there with overwhelming emotional heaviness and main plots being distracted by subplots. However, with Kimi no Na wa, Shinkai managed to hit the home run.
Now, I watched this film in Japanese theaters and my Japanese is still not where I'd want it to be but I was able to make out the story and the characters with enough confidence to write this review and I have seen the movie twice. Though, if there is a mistake story wise anywhere in this review it is likely due to a mistranslation in my head or a slip of my memory. 
Let's begin
Art/Animation:
This movie's strongest point lies in the animation. This is perhaps the most fluid, colorful, masterful drawn work of art to make the big screen in the anime business, all brought to life through the excellent cinematography, background art, setting, and sound direction that makes this film boil over with excitement and energy. Animation is used superbly with the lighting to set and bring out the tone of a scene. Every character moves so fluidly that they feel so real and full of life. This gives the movie the ability to add in the subtle motions and actions that build a character and Shinkai Makoto knows how to apply these tools. The result is a beautiful world of color and scenery everywhere you look, whether it be the skyscrapers of Tokyo, or the mountains of Takayama.
Story:
The story itself is indeed interesting and rather unique while not being completely new or complex. But what makes the story good is both the way it is told and the characters within it. The most ideal form of storytelling in my opinion is complex characters caught up in a big conflict that effects their smaller, internal conflicts and is told through a series of images, subtle actions or movements, and/or natural dialogue without the use of exposition. Kimi no Na wa has all of these, and save for two scenes of exposition about the abstract concepts of ""Tasogare (誰そ彼) and Musubi (結び) which pertain to the philosophical forces behind the movie's main concept, there is also no exposition and everything we know about the characters is either shown to us through their daily lives or we learn alongside the other characters. The story just feels natural and everything is placed in the right spot. And watching through the second time after knowing the ending you get to notice all the small and subtle hints that Shinkai was leaving along the way. 
Sound:
The music is mostly done by a band called Radwimps which I haven't heard of before this movie but they sounded awfully similar to Galileo Galilei. While not all of these songs are unique and interesting enough that I would listen to them outside of the movie much less pay money for them, they did fit the tone of the movie and were well placed with each stage of the plot. 
Character:
These characters are just an absolute joy to watch. You can't help but smile when they smile and laugh when they laugh. And though there were some anime character interaction troupes, I found each character to be believable and alive. And better yet, through the relationships the characters build with each other I feel that they all become better people than they were beforehand. Taki and Mitsuha especially, as when they start switching bodies they begin to experience each other's problems, take different approaches to solving them, and overall improve each other's lives. The romance between these two is so real and believable due to how close their experience has brought them. And most importantly, this movie was a blast! After seeing the trailer, I expected a film that would try really hard to be emotionally moving and meaningful and end up being a overbearing mess that would beat symbolism and philosophy over my head. But instead we are allowed to feel the emotions naturally as these characters take it upon themselves to solve their own problems instead of making foolish decisions to cause them, and in the midst of it all they are having fun and feel lifelike because of it. Instead of hanging around emotional sob stories and concepts, the story has an energy behind it that keeps it moving forward and gives the audience a genuine feeling of enjoyment.
Overall rating for Kimi no Na wa would be an overwhelming 8.5 for a stellar cast of characters with amazing voice actors and a very talented director making the most enjoyable and feel good movies of the year, maybe even of the decade.",8,JaegerDanger5
32281,"
                Story: (8/10)
Some viewers may have already watched any kind of show about body switching and what not but Kimi no Na wa was able to put quite an interesting twist on the trope by adding one important plot point/twist (*a bit of a spoiler*) which I think was really great and well done that it completely flipped the tables on the body switching trope. Simple story, yet well delivered and executed.
Art: (10/10)
Makoto Shinkai, 'nuff said 
Sound: (9/10)
BGM's and OST's are great and their timing on the movie is definitely on point, just didn't stick with me that much yet. I'll listen to them after this
                  :D
Characters: (9/10)
Simple cast of characters. A country girl that wants the city life and a city high school boy. I personally think that there was really not that much of a character development shown on-screen for the individual characters in terms of personal growth, but the way that these characters were put in the story and be able to ""develop to each other"" were just amazing.  Fun fact (correct me if I'm wrong lol): one side character (as listed here in MAL), the teacher was the main character in one of Shinkai's movies: Kotonoha no Niwa (also a great movie, go watch it :D)
Enjoyment: IT'S OVER 9000!!! 
I was able to watch this on the theaters with my family and boy, oh boy did I really enjoy it. I laughed, cried, and did both at the same time :D it was just that good and definitely enjoyable. Worth rewatching some other time if I can get a good copy of it. 
Overall: (10/10)
Screw criticism, I absolutely loved and enjoyed this movie, an easy 10/10 for me. Of all the Shinkai movies and shorts I've watched, Kimi no Na wa is definitely his best. Kimi no Na wa is also kind of unique among Shinkai's works because it doesn't really rely much on the melodrama (e.g. 5cm/second, Hoshi no Koe, Kotonoha no Niwa) and it even has a bit of humor in it which I think really worked well in the movie. Surely one of the best movies, not just anime movies but every movie in general to come out this year.",10,Joreruuuuu

                Well, this is one of the most popular anime movies in 2016 and most of you have probably heard of it. So, now, should you watch it or not?
 (First of all, I would like to tell you that this is my first review so I'll try to be helpful~!)
 You are searching for a movie that is romantic yet not boring at all, this is what Kimi no Na wa is. The art is very beautiful and not tiring at all, the songs are quite heart-warming and fit the movie perfectly.
 Of course, what is even more important than the art and the sound
                  is the story itself, which means that the characters have to be pleasant as well. This is a story that ,personally, interested me very much. I couldn't predict the end and I was often suprised by its development. It will, probably, make you feel sad, angry, happy, moved and that's why I was so interested in this movie! If you want to watch a regular love story of two students then sorry, this is not your place, but if you want to watch something completely outstanding that will make you confused until you finally realise what's going on and then feel the love and the warmth then yes, watch this movie please!
 About the characters, they were interesting as well. The main characters story was well connected and you could get a good idea of the characters' personality. Of course, if you want some really deep development then watch an anime series with maaany episodes. 
  Many people that have watched this movie say that it leaves a lot of questions. I have to say that I pretty much understood everything that was going on. This is not a story were only the normal occurs. It has fantasy as well. So, if by any chance you have difficulty understanding what's truly and actually going on, then don't worry, it's fantasy, you aren't supposed to understand in the first place, that's why it's called fantasy~!
  Please enjoy this movie and certainly give it a chance! But please, check out first what kind of movie you want to watch, because obviously, you won't find any fights with blood or an ordinary love story in Kimi no Na wa (Your Name.).

                Positive review: The movie is outbursting with a jubilee of colors--exploding comets, billions of stars on every evening nights, purplish/orange/pinkish dawning; almost everything is like a painting. It's a gift to all viewers to experience its surreal beauty with a mellow sensation of two lovers entangled in universe's choice of destiny. 
Negative review: A modern art book, a well-done exhibition of the anime industry, Kimi No No Wa fails to fill black holes: the justification of body-exchanging, or a cliche idea that some people are just bound by the universe for no solely reason. 
Watching Kimi No No Wa for the second time made me
                  acknowledge its pretty existence, compared to the first time I barely understood the concepts. I do not wish to offend, however I just didn't find the plot really compelling. Forgive me, once more, for being a deviant--'to each his own'. If you let me talk, I'll tell you why.
The story, which I rated 6, is because I was more-than-halfheartedly disappointed with the whole body-exchange thing--let's call it a 'phenomenon'. To add, there are many events or daresay happenstances in an anime that are labeled and explained well, in this manga/movie Shinkai-senpai (whom I respect in the highest degree for being the director, writer, producer and cinematographer of his own manga and many more works) surprises the audience of the phenomenon, no more blah blah blah. The conflict just appeared out of nowhere, like a bubble popped, and you just don't know how it happened. Let me be clear that I am not judging the author's style, but I am looking at things in an objective manner. 
For me, themes are the most essential item to any literary piece. In Kimi No No Wa, I wasn't sure to what thematic frameworks did it expand on, but the whole 'destiny' was always there, pressing. I was able to take note on cultural heritage, of small you-don't-give-a-fuck-of-what-high-school bits, and how to admire our natural surroundings as it is. 
One thing I've learned, the film brings so much memories to previous legends such as Howl's Moving Castle (a favorite of mine) or Spirited Away, wherein the 'aesthetics' appeared like they weren't created by ordinary human beings. 
However despite the bland or confusing plot, the ending did lift the story in many ways. The climax, which involved them seeing together after realization that they were meant for each other, standing in a background of paradise--it was the most beautiful thing I ever saw. 
'I love you'. あなたを愛してます. Anata o aishitemasu.
IF someone wrote this on your hand, would you be in tears as well?
Kimi No No Wa doesn't orient much, nor has impressive lines that would stick on one's head (some were repetitious), but the pleasure of merely watching it and witnessing it in front of your eyes suffices its inefficiency of a great anime. Its thoughts and ideas on love, which brings a possibility of two people being together no matter, gives a sensation--and a sense of belonging too.
It's not that the concept of 'destiny' is unique or peculiar. On the contrary it's rather common too. But readers are compelled to famous love stories, especially drastic ones, and Kimi No No Wa has a strong stance.",8,Kristinachia

                Kimi no Na Wa (Your Name) appears to be just a simple story about a long distance relationship brought together by supernatural forces. But, looking deeper, there are many motifs and symbols woven together into a beautifully animated movie about connections and dreams. 
The story seemed to be about a simple high school romance, but in truth the plot was more complex than it seemed. The overall story line was about the two main characters trying to find each other despite being so far apart. Some parts in the beginning (about 30 minutes into the movie) were a bit confusing, but in the end, everything
                  is explained tied together. 
Furthermore, the animation--including the coloring--and detailed illustrations provided context clues as well as foreshadowing. Moreover, it gave the audience an awe-inspiring experience into the symbolic concepts and motifs throughout the film.
The soundtrack was an amazing companion to the stunning visuals presented, and truly made us feel closer to the world on the screen. The band RADWIMPS produced a catchy opening, fitting background songs, and a bittersweet ending that evoked emotions and left people wanting more.
Despite all the amazing visual components and overall plot, the reason why we did not give it a 10/10 was because the ending was unsatisfactory. It left our hearts feeling incomplete. But, regardless, Kimi no Na Wa was a superb adventure that is sure to touch many people.",9,potatotakus

                On a technical level, ""Kimi no Na Wa"" is breathtaking; every single frame catches the viewer's attention because of its intricately deep and complex art style.  It features backgrounds that any conventional artist would spend hours drawing and painting: In a sense, ""Kimi no Na Wa"" is a moving painting with each frame and each movement beautifully woven into the movie.  The movie's orchestrated soundtrack emphasizes its artistic beauty with music nearly as intricate and detailed as the animation itself.
So then, why does ""Kimi no Na Wa"" seem so shallow to me in comparison to its art?
Under the catching appeal of its art
                  style is its unfortunately mangled and somewhat tedious story.  The characters are ultimately forgettable:  some could argue that this is the point, as the protagonists are supposed to be ordinary school children struggling against an unknown and mysterious force of 'nature'.  However, I would attribute their lack of memorability to both the plot and the protagonists' characters.  
The plot sets up a great sense of mystery and discovery, but fails to address overarching questions that are integral to the story's development.  In addition, the story is all over the place:  it is not evident what the driving force of the two protagonist's dilemma is, but concludes without addressing major plot points that leaves a bitter and confusing taste in the viewer's mouth.  As such, a plot can carry a character and is the driving force of their development; a protagonist cannot carry the plot.  Therefore, it would seem impossible for the protagonist to be better than their plot.  That's not to say that the plot of ""Kimi no Na wa"" is bad by any standards; it's a heartwarming and wholesome story that concludes with a good theme that would become applicable to any viewer's life (a very important thing to do).  However, and perhaps most importantly, the story has no impact and is ultimately forgettable.  
""Kimi no Na wa"" deserves its hype and rating on a technical scale, raising the standard of anime to a level it hasn't achieved before.  It has the beautiful movement of a Studio Ghibli movie while containing art that would take conventional artists endless hours to create.  However, its plot is lackluster, with unanswered crucial and pressing questions that are utilized as a driving force to the plot, but is ultimately still enjoyable.  
A 6 on my scale is what some would conventionally consider a 7 or 8 (refer to profile).  Therefore, I would recommend this movie.",6,cIayton
32281,"
                To me this anime is magical, and after rewatching this for probably the 10th time now, it still is.
Kimi no Na wa is an anime about destiny and the hardships and sacrifices that come with it.
Before I talk about anything else in this anime, I have to mention the amazingly beautiful animation that comes in this. In terms of production, well I can't imagine how hard Makoto Shinkai and his team put into this. The animation is amazing. The detail he put into those Shinkai signature backgrounds are unprecedented. The rendering of lighting is so crisp and clean(its amazingly in every scene too). Even the
                  cinematography is top notch and how thoughtfully the direction Shinkai made  in how scenes intertwine to make sense. You need a lot of time to think about this stuff too. All in all, the animation is an absolute eye candy.
The story was magnificently written, which is great because Shinkai isn't primarily known for his writing unlike his masterful animation. The monologues the characters make are thought provoking, as if it were a poem. The atmosphere, backed up with that beautiful animation, struck me in awe. Like I said, the way scenes will intertwine at points and make sense is an absolute revelation in terms of plot presentation. For those who aren't sold on the premise nor the hype surrounding this anime, all I can say is that this anime is more than a cheesy romantic body swapping anime. I was surprised and so will you be.
The way Shinkai made average characters into these wonderfully lovable characters is almost Hayao Miyazaki-esque. Taki and Mitsuha aren't superheroes. They are like us, average people who were given these great circumstances. Shinkai found a fine line between creating this epic plot and not over-dramatizing it. And I believe that is what makes this anime feel so relatable.
The soundtrack which was made by RADWIMPS is absolutely amazing too. I am usually skeptical about Japanese indie-rock bands in anime. But they have done a great job in complementing scenes with their music. Even without the anime the songs are great to listen to.
This anime has a special place in my heart. Its the reason I got into anime in the first place. It told me the true potential of what great anime can be.
It's 2018, I don't know how you haven't watched this and you're reading this. Just watch it. I guarantee a minimal of 8. But for me, its a 10/10.",10,deimos96

                Kimi no Na wa. (Your Name.) was an explosion that no one saw coming. It's made an amazing amount of revenue over in Japan, and is as of this writing the highest-rated anime on all of MAL. 
This immediately captured my interest for the film, though I forced myself to lower my expectations before watching...I was a bit underwhelmed by the director's Byousoku 5 Centimeter (5 Centimeters Per Second) because I was expecting was a masterpiece from it, and what I got was simply good/average.
However, I am pleased to say that I feel like this film more than deserves a spot in MAL's top anime
                  and definitely its top anime films.
STORY (9/10):
Doesn't get a perfect score due to a minor issue in Character (we'll get to that later) that affects the overall film from being perfect, but was great other than that. Very entertaining and captivating from the beginning, and does some unique things with the stale old body-swapping plot that I won't spoil.
ART (10/10):
It's beautiful as all hell. I had to watch this in a 480p rip, but I absolutely have to watch it again on Blu-Ray. The amount of detail into every frame is amazing, and I was surprised by how much I loved it even in 480p.
This is going to sound kind of weird, but there's a scene with a female character smoking that's just...sort of perfect. Her facial expression really sets the atmosphere and tells us a lot about her character without her saying much, and honestly it's kinda sexy. (Kids, don't smoke.)
SOUND (9/10):
The voice acting was very good, and I hope FUNimation's dub will do the film justice. The music in the film was a personal favorite of the director's, and despite his bias he was able to use it to the movie's advantage. It never felt out of place or gratuitous.
CHARACTER (8/10):
There's just one little problem. While I cared for the main characters and knew enough about their background that the story was able to have an impact on me, looking back...there really isn't as much information given about them as would have been ideal. We don't know much about Taki's home life, for example; we only see a brief glimpse of his dad, while Mitsuha's family life is fleshed out.
Even still, I loved the characters and their interactions with each other. It all felt very realistic and never felt too sappy or cheesy.
ENJOYMENT (9/10):
Great story, outstanding artwork, great music. What wasn't to enjoy?
OVERALL (9/10):
In conclusion, I highly recommend Kimi no Na wa. to any anime fan, but especially those who enjoy romance, drama, or have enjoyed Makoto Shinkai's work in the past. If you watch the rip online, be sure to watch it again on Blu-Ray. It's going to be even more beautiful, and the backgrounds are going to make amazing wallpapers.

                Wow! Go and see this for the art alone.
I'm not a massive fan of drama and romance anime, but I can easily say that Kimi no Na wa is a wonderful example of both genres. 
For the first half of the movie, I couldn't fault it much at all. I was sitting in a relatively crowded theatre and all our eyes were glued to the screen.
Right from the start it's amazingly entertaining to follow both Taki and Mitsuha as they work out their 'Freaky Friday' connection, and watch them discover more and more about each others' lives. The little 'life improvements' they try to make
                  whilst in each others bodies also made me laugh out loud. The emotional attachment the two mains feel towards each other during this process does end up being a little rushed though. 
When Taki finally decides he has to meet Mitsuha in person after their connection has seemingly been broken, so begins the second half of the story to explain it all.
For me, the last third of the movie did fall into the familiar category, but, the story as whole is still outstanding. 8/10
Geez, the art. Beautiful sweeping shots, vibrant colours, stunning landscapes, brilliant animation. Any of the scenes with the comet (supporting cast member #1) were visually spectacular. Best animation anywhere right now and I would watch it again purely for this reason alone. 10/10
I'm gonna skip straight to how much I enjoyed this. Like I mentioned before, I'm not really one for watching romance anime, so for me to write a review about one... It was that awesome. 
I prefer to think of this movie as one of magic instead of being supernatural.
The journey both Taki and Mitsuha have to go on to finally discover each other is rather amazing to watch and (apart from the body-swapping thing) the characters are quite relatable. Everyone at one time or another wants to be somewhere else, living a different life, but you also hope to connect to that someone who just gets who you are. 9/10
Great characters, both main and supporting. The art, oh the art... well, do yourself an anime favour and see this for that reason alone. 
And apart from it needing to be fleshed out a little near the beginning and a predictable ending, the story is still fantastic, full of magic and wonderfully written. It's going to be a while until we see something of this calibre again. 9/10",9,lights_blacK

                ""Kimi No Na Wa"" is one of those few things that you remember for the remainder of your life.
The Anime opens with a smooth introduction that ignites interest from the get-go.
It actually takes 5 minutes to be inundated into the wonderful existence of the Designated Characters.
The story is entirely basic as to begin with, however, as you advance you figure out how multi-layered this film truly is. 
The anime demonstrates the sheer acumen of the human personality. 
The anime engulfs the immaculate and theoretical speculations about time and space and associates them in a way that any individual would find breath-taking.
The characters of the anime
                  are exceptionally well-built which is extremely hard to reach in such a limited capacity of time. 
However the reason for its significant prevalence was the bittersweet moments inoculated into the anime,
These moments show us that regardless of how hard we attempt, there are hurdles which accompany the progression of life and can only be removed by the flow of time.
""Peace of Mind"" is one of those things.
It is not entirely a sentimental anime, however beyond any doubt pulls on one's heart strings. 
I trust the alacrity and energetic promptness which was incorporated into Mizunha's character was one the many reasons behind its brilliance.
In a nutshell, if you're looking for a story which is both thrilling and vibrant then ""Kimi No Na Wa"" is for you.

                Let's get this out of the way: the visuals are gorgeous.
The plot and characters are not, especially the main guy who is kind of a scumbag with the body swap stuff. On top of that the plot has so many holes you could call it swiss cheese. So many inconsistencies and head scratchers and so many unanswered questions that the movie just never seemed to think about. Worth watching for the visuals but don't expect a story or characters on the level of something like A Silent Voice because you won't be getting one. You'll be getting a fine story with some forgettable characters. The
                  premise feels almost squandered at points with how many things left me going ""alright but why""",7,infoworms
32281,"
                Motifs of halves, invisible walls and the opening and closing of doors are peppered all over this classic Shinkai romantic-fantasy experience. It is becoming increasingly easy to view this film as ultimately a simple tale of emotional human connections that transcends space-time, but the way it frames it is a whole other story.
This film is drop-dead gorgeous. Ultimately, as a cinematic experience, little could be faulted: intriguing match cuts and repeated camera angles that's positioned low & directly halving the sliding door frame, signature Shinkai low angle pans that envelops the centred character in the midst of a vibrant multi-dimensional space, incredulous amount of attention
                  given to dirtying the background details and giving the film a sense of idealised but grounded normality. And oh LORD the film's colour palettes and simulated lighting and shadows man...
The sound design steps up above anime norms with reverb, echo and textured audio deliveries and mixing, giving Your Name even more polish, while the music more than held its weight with strings and piano-heavy melodies that suffices as environment supplements.
As for the overall verdict...this is by far Shinkai's most thematically satisfying and funny feature films thus far, being able to time its both so charmingly Japanese anime sense of humour with well-utilised cutting that only invites more amusement. Although this viewer will have to voice a slight concern with the occasionally over-utilised 'toilet jokes' to deliver sexual innuendo-heavy comedy: tonally, it holds its own with the comedic elements; but clashes heavily with the drama-heavy main plot.
Your Name deserves its recognition. Matoko Shinkai's gloriously self-indulgent and aware efforts here pulls references and teases from almost every one of his previous projects, ultimately creating an experience that's 100% Shinkai. And it's pretty great.",8,NaChiKyoTsuki97

                This isn't even my kind of genre, but I was blown away by this movie as a whole. I wouldn't necessarily call it the best anime movie of all time (based on its rank on this site), but it's up there. Way up there, like within the top 3.
If you try to pick it apart, you'll find some issues (as is the case with any anime), but as a package this movie just ""feels"" like a 10/10. If not for the production quality than for the sheer satisfaction of the story itself. And even if the movie was designed for a japanese audience, you can
                  tell how much passion was put in.
**spoilers below**
Story:
No, it wasn't perfect. Most romance movie plotlines aren't. The laws of the time-bending in the movie don't really have much logic to them, as was the case with Steins;gate, but it's not good to compare a movie to a series. Maybe the pacing was a bit weird in the second half, but overall I thought the story served its purpose in developing the bond between the mitsuha/taki which was the whole point of the story. You might care surprisingly little about the side characters and you care a lot about whether the two will ever find each other again. This matters. In the girl who leapt through time, a similar movie, I couldn't bring myself to care about the romantic plotline, which ruined the satisfaction.
Art/Sound:
The art was ridiculously good. There wasn't a single scene that looked bad, and I don't understand how they make drawings of this quality. They somehow blend insanely well drawn anime with some ridiculously beautiful sky-rendering thing without the viewer noticing the contrast, which really makes it feel like you have a window into that universe.
Sound is a very subjective category. I wasn't crazy about the music, but it did fit the movie just fine. 
Character:
Not bad. None of the characters were particularly notable, even the main characters. They had rather normal personalities and lives, but I guess that's realistic given the setting. 
Enjoyment:
All the pieces fit together into an incredibly good experience. Movies have limitations, and the amount of plot they fit into this <2 hour runtime was very good, so pacing really should be overlooked here. Just watch it if you haven't already.",9,AnimeBear422

                I'll write my review using categorization, so that means I'll talk about everything in different sections of the review. I'll start with the story, then work my way to the art, sound, characters, and so on. First, I'll provide some very basic information about the production. Kimi no Na wa. (Your Name in English) is set within two recurring places in Japan--Tokyo and a small rural town called Itomori. The two main characters are high-school students who come from completely different walks of life--Miyamizu Mitsuha and Tachibana Taki. I'm no die-hard anime critic or anything, but I just felt like writing this after viewing it
                  because I think that plentiful input on such an amazing production is relevant. All in all, you receive a great experience, but there's just something about the movie that feels a little disjointed. 
- Story: 7.5 
I honestly wanted to give the story a 7, but a 7.5 seems more fitting and deserved. I know a 7 in general seems pretty harsh for such a critically acclaimed movie, but I'd like to think that my personal interpretation and opinion is ""justified"" in a way. And personally, to me, a 7 isn't too bad of a score. Anyway, the story starts off very smoothly. We get an introduction of the focus characters and their respective lives; no problems or issues there. I have to say that the starting conflict and mystery is introduced to us in such a clever, well-structured manner. The overall movie flowed together pretty nicely, but I couldn't help but to feel lost at times. I went from feeling completely blown away and amazed, to feeling like something was missing, to feeling lost, to feeling like my emotions were being played with, then to feeling like something more was missing and the story didn't know where to go. A note to make about the film is the fact that it is of the supernatural genre, and many anime tend to struggle to fully explain the cause of the supernatural phenomenon. I felt like that was the problem with Kimi no Na wa., but it was 'pleasantly confusing' in a way that I can't fully explain. What saves it is the attempt at such a unique, rich explanation that makes you wonder and question everything. Take away the niches and personality of the film, and the somewhat understandable explanation pretty much gives you the typical multiple world line theory--if you've seen Steins;gate, then it's very similar to that. Other then getting lost at times, I really felt like the story was a little one-sided because the main male protagonist was a little underdeveloped. It's not that he was underdeveloped, but myself personally felt like the screentime for the main female character was way more focused, enjoyable and story-driven. The story does a great job with building expectations, but just falls a little flat because the thought of something is missing just can't be knocked.
- Story (NOTE): I think it's ironic for me because there is a pleasant little inclusion or ""easter egg"" of a different anime film I saw a while ago called 5 Centimeters Per Second in this, and only people who have seen that movie will understand. I almost instantly caught it and gasped lol. What makes it ironic is the fact that the same writer and creator for Kimi no Na wa., Makoto Shinkai, also wrote 5 Centimeters Per Second. I only found that out after I viewed this movie, so that was pretty interesting to pick up. I guess old habits or niches that writers may have die hard haha. 
- Art: 10
The art in Kimi no Na wa. honestly speaks for itself. The animation is beautiful and aesthetically pleasant. The character art is relatively well done with little to no drop in detail when they're shown in certain scenes. I could tell that a lot of effort and opportunity played huge parts in the artwork because the cleverly executed camera angles only emphasized the beauty of the film. Pivotal shots and scenes are more memorable and influential because of the various angles used. I know I'm a sucker when it comes to animation, but the art alone is one reason alone to even consider watching this production. One thing I want to say is that you may find yourself distracted or taken away from the story itself because the art is just amazing all by itself. 
- Sound: 9
The sound gets a solid 9. I would have gave it a 10, but I didn't feel like there was anything overly outstanding with the sounds. The right themes just played at the right times in order to provide a more rich and indulgent experience for the viewer. If you were meant to feel sad at one point, then the theme helped convey and set that particular tone. If a scene was meant to be more dramatic and taken seriously, then the theme really helped enforce what you were meant to feel. The soundtrack is definitely worth looking out for if you're one to appreciate them. 
- Characters: 7
The characters get a solid 7 for me because I feel like there just could have been more to them than what we got. Now, I mean that when I talk about the main characters and the supporting characters. For me, there were mostly no overly memorable characters. Yes, the supporting characters have their own personalities and traits, but they ultimately fall short on impact and meaning to the story barring a few exceptions. The story itself felt a bit forced and overwhelming for me, so the character development really seemed to get the short end of the stick. The characters themselves aren't pointless and meaningless because there are some nice and appreciative characters introduced. The story just tries so hard to work with the two main characters and offer explanations that the supporting characters seem like they're missing out on something. I'd like to think of the supporting characters as glue and the main characters as the paper, and the story is the surface that the characters are glued to. I stated that there is one-sided progression in my story section of this review, well, that also shows for the characters. Overall, the characters are decent and some are definitely noteworthy. 
- Enjoyment: 9
Despite the very constructive criticism that I have stated in my review, I think Kimi no Na wa. is rich and filled with astonishment. I found myself completely engulfed in my viewing. I feel like the introduction and rising action of the film was the most delightful part of it for me. Confusion may overtake you, but as I stated in my story section it is a pleasant kind of confusion and not overbearing. Scenes often leave you eager to know what comes next and how the story unfolds. It does an excellent job with keeping you interested and keeping up your expectations. I would definitely recommend it to a friend who likes anime.",8,FreshOutOfF--ks

                Okay let's talk Your Name. 
This is the fifth movie  by director Makoto Shinkai and was animated by CoMix Wave Films. 
Now going into this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I only saw the first 18 mins in Japanese. I liked it, but was so busy with other anime I just wanted to focus on that and wait for it to be dubbed because I felt the story translated better to an English speaking audience with English voices. So, I was pretty open minded heading into Your Name. 
I would like to preface this review that I saw this movie dubbed. I'm glad
                  I did because the English dub songs have to be some of the best I ever heard in an anime. They were top notch and the singer for them put a lot of heart into it. The overall English Dub cast was also excellent. I really felt Sheh and Post did an amazing job in their roles with pulling you into their characters. Sheh really has taken off since she was Usagi in the Sailor Moon Crystal dub. She really took the bulls by the horns and made it her own. I felt Michael Sinterniklaas also did a solid job as Taki. I think the most shocking performance has to be Hitoha played by Glynis Ellis. This was her first role in an anime production and she fucking nailed it. Very good work for a newcomer. Very risky to give a rookie a part in such a big film. Good casting right there by Funimation.
Starting off with the art and animation for this film, it's flat out beautiful. They really nail the realistic areas of Japan and how Japanese people actually look. I felt this was very refreshing, since a lot of anime exaggerates everything. Every character in the movie has very realistic propositions and body types. 
Your Name tells the tale of two star cross lovers, Mitsuha and Taki, who one day can suddenly switch bodies with each other. They start to experience and grow from the body swap. As they get to experience what is like being the opposite gender. They both have their friends that play the supporting roles in their respective lives. One of the biggest and most interesting for me would be Miki since she shows an important growth with our main man Taki. I think the biggest side character for Mitsuha would be Hitoha. The others do a good job playing the role of friends and have their little moments. The pacing and storytelling is really top notch and gets a lot of detail and world building out of the way very fast. The writing is nearly airtight with an excellent plot twist near the midway point I didn't see coming but plays out a very realistic scenario. They do a good job flushing out their main leads and giving good define roles to the supporting characters. 
On the downside, it is never really explains how they are able to switch bodies and I feel that keeps the movie from being perfect since that was nearly the first half of the movie. I also felt Taki could have used a little more screen time since they spent 18 mins on Mitsuha. I felt he could have gotten the same treatment. 
Overall the story is enjoyable from beginning to end and has a very sweet ending that isn't your typical romance ending. They also do a good job using their title of their film.",9,MasterHavik

A brief, personal, non-spoiler, review.
--
First off let me just say. You haven't seen this film until you've seen it in it's intended quality, aka, theatrical 4k or the BD release. All of those people that watched the rip have not seen the film and completely disrespected Shinkai, Radwimps, and the entire team behind the film, possibly even just the industry in general.
Just going to go into the sound first. I'm not gonna lie and
                  say ""Huurrr hurr I've been a fan of Radwimps since forever"" No. I became a fan late 2014 and then later became a fan of Illion. Ever since I heard about Radwimps doing the soundtrack for this film I had no doubt that it would be incredible, and then once I heard the release of Sparkle...Oh boy. 
They used the music of Radwimps to it's full potential, their music plays throughout most of the film but whenever they played any lyrical music, it was powerful. They used the lyrical music whenever they wanted to really pull you into the scene, it was a sign that you simply needed to watch as the visuals blow you away. 
Radwimps often make the scene in this film if their music wasn't there I honestly believe this movie would've been directed in a completely different way.
--
The characters, Taki & Mitsuha, to say the very least are...Adorable, tragic and simple.
Mitsuha is a character that's more fleshed out, we get to see her past, her interactions with friends and family. Taki on the other hand is more of a standalone character. We know he has a crush, a busy scheduled school life, and somewhat how routine with friends. We also get small indications at his family life but nothing much.
This is more of a film about the interactions of two characters and the people that just happen to be around them at the time.
The two go through distant interactions over a non specified amount of time without properly ever meeting. Over these interactions are plenty of funny & cute moments that bring the two closer together. It's an interesting form of development I've never seen done before that could honestly only be done in this kind of long distance situation.

Animation & Direction. 
Oh boy...I couldn't believe the visuals in this film. I honestly though they had pushed it to the limit with Garden of Words and whilst that film may have some situations where it's visuals are better. In no way is the direction better than Kimi no Na wa, the use of camera is also insane, not only was the animation team pushed to it's limits (Also I swear the ""Big Boom"" scene was mostly Naoki Kobayashi...I could be wrong) but the CG team was also, with incredible use of camera movement and scenic use of digital production.
In true Shinkai nature though the amount of scenery views is outstanding and crazily detailed. Just the fact there are heavily detailed scenes which could put a lot of illustrators to shame with modified layers to create movement, and a dynamic way of doing backgrounds to create a great sense of depth ( Refer to Niko-P for the technique https://twitter.com/nik_jyp/status/774715554548494336 ).
--
For my personal enjoyment, well...It's Shinkai, I love his style of writing and his attitude towards the execution of his movies, of course I'm referring to how he would literally just have random things drawn into scenes that he bought from shops. 
It's not my favourite Shinkai film, Garden of Words, connected with me on a more personal level. But Kimi no Na wa, is undoubtedly the better film and is a must watch for all and every anime fan. But wait for the theatrical or BD release, don't go watching poor rips on the internet, it will ruin such an experience. 
It's a 10/10 for me. Once again, thank you Makoto Shinkai, Radwimps, and the entire development team. Respect for you all, all of you deserve the success you've gotten from this film, what a wonderful passion project this was.",10,Gay2DGrillsPls

                I find this movie to be extremely overhyped, the story is pretty dumb itself, with nothing exceptional happening, the characters are really really bad, nothing particularly good about them, as I find both the main characters to be quite bland. You can't say anything much about the animation, it's really good (it's to be expected in anime movies though). Same thing with the sound, it's good. I didn't enjoy the show, I spent a good part of the movie on my phone, and couldn't wait for it to be over, it's really not emotional, I don't get the people saying otherwise. Overall it's a 6,
                  it gets saved by the good job done by the animators.",6,TimmyHighlander

                This is my first anime movie review. I generally don't watch anime movies but this movie trailer looked interesting so I decided to watch it. I watched this last Friday night. This is my first Makoto Shinkai movie I have ever seen. I decided to review this because I wanted to express how amazing this movie really is. I do not spoil much or at all in this review as I want others to see how great this movie really is.
This masterpiece of a movie is truly amazing in every aspect from start to finish.
The story is about Mitsuha and Taki, who switch bodies at
                  random times, and are trying to figure out why this is happening, as well as adapting to the lives of each other by learning how each other live. They are aware of what is going on so they make rules on what they can and can not do and post them on their phones.
The art is amazing. Great animation, visuals, and design for each character. The colour scheme of the comet is one of the most beautiful thing I have seen in anime. 
The audio and soundtrack/background music are amazing. It makes the movie more immersive. Every sound matches the setting of that scene perfectly.
The characters in this movie are superb. I love every single character of this movie from their design to development; how their relationship with each other change from beginning to end.
This movie overflowed me with enjoyment. My emotions were like a rollercoaster. Certain scenes in this movie left me in either awe or tears. I kept wanting to see what was going to happen next and how the main characters end up meeting each other. I also loved learning the culture of the rural area, how things are connected/tied together by Musubi (Japanese god).
Overall, I give this a 10/10. This movie is a MUST watch.
Everything about the movie was great. I don't think their could be anything else that could be improved (of course there's always something).
Thank you Makoto Shinkai for this wonderful experience of a movie.",10,MeesterYellow

                Would be 10/10 for enjoyement if the ending wouldn't have triggered my PTSD with 20 minutes of not knowing if it will be a shit one after such an interesting story.. and what do I get? Conclusion in 1 fucking minute. Really?? That's all it this gets?? *wipes tears with Clannad - Afterstory DVD* :/
I mean it's from scumbag Makoto Shinkai who like triggering PTSDs really easily with people who enjoy the #drama tag..
Story: interesting.. timetravel x bodyswap, mm gotta feel dem boobz again with our own hand huh c:
Art: Still not the best, but it's great, has some beautiful moments.
Sound: They weren't that outstanding,
                  mostly stock sounds (there were some from MMO games as well), nothing really impactful that would've made me feel like i'm inside the ""Movie"", other than when they swapped bodies at the meteor scene. Gotta love that one.
Character: They managed to stay alive somehow and developed some habits of informing the other one on what they did and they grow closer to each other. Although some of their feelings weren't represented correctly and were timed badly..
Enjoyement: If I hadn't get a PTSD with the ending and the conclusion wouldn't have been cut off in 1 minute after 20 minutes of literally nothing happening, it would've been 10/10
Overall 9/10. Great story poorly represented x_x",9,higurush

                ""Love does not know distances"": this message has been exploited in many literary and cinematographic works. In the present case, it is not new in the works of Shinkai Makoto. It has been several weeks since I decided to watch Kimi no na wa, something that I do not regret and that made me want to grab my keyboard to tell you about it.
Kimi no na wa or Your Name tells us the story of two teenagers bound by their dreams. Mitsuha, living in a small village and coming from a traditional family, wants to go on the adventure of the huge urban jungle of
                  Tokyo while Taki, city dweller of the Japanese capital and lover of drawings, leads a normal life between high school And a little job in an Italian restaurant. The two make strange dreams in which they find themselves in the skin of the other and it is from there that their relationship will be woven, learning to know each other through the life that each one leads.
Their dreams are actually exchanges of bodies: Mitsuha is found in Taki's body and vice versa. However, as I progressed through the story, I became aware that I was far from imagining that the theme would be treated with such a dimension. Faithful to himself, Shinkai Makoto offers us a surprising and moving story, reinforced by its mystical character. I would not hide that I even had the little tear at the end.
Yet, the beginning of the plot is developed comically. We see the exchanges between the characters who try to adapt as well as possible to the phenomenon and to communicate to ""set the rules of the game"". The events are connected fast enough while the whole takes shape little by little. We see how they are going to manage this delicate situation, captivating enough not to wonder why there is this exchange. Like everyone else I guess, I would have had a heck of a lot of fun getting someone to borrow my body regularly especially if it's for exams in my place (unless it's better than me!). Is not that what we call trust?
Speaking of trust, it is through this first step that ""forced marriage"" is built between our two characters, the latter transforming into passion over time. Equipped with a good personality, their journey makes them charismatic thanks to a particularly interesting treatment. Beyond the only message of love, there is this whole question of intimacy because everyone has access to the whole life of the other and through their practical experience they are able to understand each other better than anyone else. There is a more human dimension given to this exchange that it would be possible to find in other stories where this one is most often seen as a constraint for the characters. But here it becomes a very useful tool and even more. It quickly turns into something bigger without it becoming exaggerated.
The supernatural is present and keeps all its mystery as it should. The idea is not to understand how but just to know the why of the phenomenon and some simple elements are given in order to satisfy our curiosity about the issue.
If love is irrational, the phenomenon that binds our protagonists is just as much. While they are unable to understand this strange force, they progress and struggle to stay together. It is so beautiful and so disturbing at the same time and thanks to this emerges an exciting scenario. Because of its construction, Kimi no na wa has a plot full of twists and turns. 
Both joyful and moving, I find that this is what best characterizes my feelings on this film. So why would I say it in a complicated way if I can just say so?
The story makes you think and each one can interpret the plans and the stunning images of this film. They are meaningful either to amaze you or to move you. So there is no question of forcing you the message but more of you putting it at your free disposal and appreciating it in all its splendor.
A word comes to my mind on which I hardly see how you could contradict me: magnificent!",9,Mannou-Sama

                I can honestly say that this is one of the greatest anime movies I have ever had the good fortune to watch, thanks to a good friend who reccomended it me. The soundtrack and art is absolutely spellbinding and the animations truly make this a 'Masterpiece'. I highly reccomend people watch this anime for the true splendor it is! 
The story along with the music have an incredible effect on the viewers and its that intricacy that I absolutely adore, not many anime's are able to create such an effect, which is why I couldn't stop loving this anime from start to end.",10,Syk_111

                Here’s the thing with Makoto Shinkai; he has extremely interesting, daring and even admirable ideas. But the thing is... He’s a hack who can’t  get the fundamental basics down. His characters are cardboard cutouts of people lacking any intrigue or believability; his stories are full of holes, constantly contradict themselves and weirdly communicate their themes. 
Most of his films falter due to him being way too ambitious and putting more effort in forcing in unnecessary symbolism and constant backgrounds shots (and his weird fucking fixation with feet) alongside his out there writing style instead of focusing on improving. Kimi no na wa suffers from
                  this the most. The biggest thing with Kimi No na wa is; the moment you think about ANYTHING, it falls apart. This is a common theme you’ll be seeing in this review. 
Shinkai’s stories tend to focus on the idea of distance, and how it impacts a romantic relationship between two individuals. Kimi No na wa has a cool body swapping idea, and it uses that as basis for its romance. The problem is that the two individuals in Your Name are not only extremely bland, but when you think about it for a bit, the supposed relationship between them isn’t believable at all. Taki is the most boring character of all time. We know next to nothing about him or his past; his relationship with his parents, what he wants to do with his life, ANYTHING. He has a talent for drawing, that’s cool. Why not try exploring that facet of him? Of course not. We need to fucking shove cringe comedy down your throat instead; depth??? What’s that? And it’s not like he only lacks any depth, his personality is TERRIFYINGLY dull and gives harem protagonists a run for their money. All of the scenes with him are insufferably boring, and the film tries masking that and tricking you into thinking otherwise with its cringe sol comedy where characters do weird shit and act out of character because funny haha. 
Mitsuha, on the other hand, does have some personality to her; Yea, she’s pretty cliched and by the numbers, but eh. Anyway, the thing with her is that she lacks much depth. Her relationship with her father is a bit of a mess, is the hack shinkai going to explore said relationship or at least give her some sort of conflict or ANYTHING that’ll resonate with the audience and possibly Taki as well which would kind of explain his affection for her? (The movie can also write itself in a way where it can go both ways with Taki possibly solving some sort of long withstanding family conflict for her which would also gain her affection) No sir, that wouldn’t be retarded. We can’t have that. All her character boils down to is that she wants to leave her garbage village, and that’s it! That’s all they learn while they’re in each others bodies; Taki is boring and generic with no aspirations or passion or ANYTHING and Mitsuha is a bit interesting, but there’s nothing to her. I have two questions now: 1- Why do they like each other????? And 2- Why should I even fucking care lol? 
Why would Mitsuha fall for him? Why would he fall for her? Why would he go through so much for her? They know nothing about each other; Taki is insanely boring and dull, Mitsuha is empty and superficial. Why? I don’t get it. The movie didn’t use any of the first half to set itself up properly, so it all falls on top of itself. 
The side characters are nothing and add nothing to the experience. All of them are used for dumb comedy and aren’t characterized properly or fleshed out or anything, really. The girl he had a crush on was kinda interesting, but she’s a nothing character with nothing to really say about. The grandmother is just an excuse to shove info dumps down your throat because the film is unable to spread this information out and it probably doesn’t even want you to think about it if I’m honest.  
Another common theme in this film is PLOT HOLES; The calendar one being the most obvious one; the fact that they somehow never saw the actual date is just... wow. The timing of the body swappings makes no sense whatsoever alongside that baffling final act with the meteorites. The movie tries hiding this from you; that’s the thing with shinkai, he’s self conscious and knows what’s exactly wrong with his writing, but he doesn’t know how to fix it so he tries hiding it and silently hopes that the audience will just buy his bullshit. And that’s kind of what happened here, but whatever. Anyway,the fact that they didn’t notice the time difference is fucking retarded and shinkai should be ashamed of himself. 
The art is just nothing to really write home about, I guess?. The character designs are as bland as the characters themselves and clash unnaturally with the admittedly nice aesthetic. The photo realistic backgrounds are good, but the idea of “photo realistic backgrounds” just never really sat right with me. It just lacks the authenticity of hand drawn cel animation, plus you can just fucking google them lol. 
The movie PUNISHES you for thinking. It doesn’t want you to question, ponder or analyze it. It doesn’t want you to think about the weak romance or the plot holes or the lifeless character designs; it desperately tries distracting you from these aspects. Bad character designs? Spam a bunch of background shots ad nauseam. Badly written characters? Spam 400 unfunny comedic scenes. Plot holes? Make the story as convoluted as humanely possible and silently hope the Mitsubishi shit or whatever the fuck it’s  called is enough to distract them. Just mediocre. 
I know this is extremely short and I didn’t really get into the plot holes as much as I could have, but I kind of don’t like writing reviews anymore tbh; anything more than this is just...no lol.",5,-Frost-

I don't want to admit it, but I did not see the plot twist coming.
Story: Great balance of time-traveling body swapping comedy, and long distance relationship. Sure, there were large gaping plot holes here and there, but while I was watching it I thought very little of it because feels. Also, I'd like to mention that the whole body swapping thing is not explained fully, its just passed off as ""ancient magic""... that's kinda cheap.
Art: Seriously, 5 wallpapers per second, goddamn. One thing I want to point out is how the characters when switched have noticeable different postures and movements. I thought it was
                  really neat from an animation standpoint. 
Sound: The music fits the story & characters perfectly, but I did not enjoy the 4 random song break things out of the blue.
Character: The genius but curse of this movie is that the audience rarely get to see the characters be in their own bodies and environment, character development in situations like this is hard to do, but the film managed to pull it off, however I feel like I still don't know our protagonists way enough because there is very little background information about them (ehem TakI).
Enjoyment: 1 hour and 45 minutes of pure joy. The movie is just so fun.
Overall: Funny and heartwarming eye candy.",10,doctorpark

                Tl;Dr It's a good film that will make you feel empty afterwards.
Kimi no Na wa (lit. your name.)  is easily the best anime film in 2016- if not one of the best anime films of all time. Created, directed and written by Makoto Shinkai -the same creator of ""5 Centimeters per Second"" and ""Garden of Words""- and produced by CoMix Wave Films, Kimi no Na wa is a beautifully animated, thought-provoking and for some, tear-inducing film. Though this film is not perfect in every aspect, it is still a masterpiece in its own right.
Before I start, there's something special about the film Kimi no
                  Na wa compared to other Makoto Shinkai films that I have noticed. Kimi no Na wa runs for a total time of 106 minutes- more than 2 times than that of other films done by him. The extra 40-60 minutes are actually essential to the plot and without it, Kimi no Na wa might have become a TRAINwreck with bad pacing- but it is good that this was not the case.
The story starts off with what you see in the description- Taki, our quick-tempered male protagonist who lives in the city of Tokyo, finds himself in the body of Mitsuha, our shy female protagonist who lives in the rural village of Itomori. Later, he finds out that Mitsuha had also found herself in his body and soon, they find out a way to indirectly communicate with each other whilst keeping the other party's lifestyle in check. For normal anime these days, this type of plot has the potential to deviate into a more... ecchi based plotline. But, fortunately, this is not the case for Kimi no Na wa and this movie actually manages to achieve excellence without much fanservice. However, the story is not completely based around body-swapping and the plot soon thickens into mystery and heartbreak. I will not spoil too much about the actual plotline, but the main story of Kimi no Na wa revolves around searching. Searching for different things- places, friendship, people, romance and even names. The protagonists are always, always constantly searching for something, even if it might not make much sense to them or the audience at that moment, even until the end of the movie. The true beauty about this movie are the moments in which they manage to uncover and truly find the ""thing"" they are looking for, while the heart-breaking moments are the times where they find that ""thing"" after a long and arduous journey, only for it to slip from their grasp and disappear, turning the emotions of both the protagonists and the audience from initial happiness and relief to gloom and despair. There are many moments in this movie that shook me a little, and though I didn't tear up, it was guaranteed that someone else did. Emotional parts aside, Kimi no Na wa's story also allows for some thought-provoking moments, and mind me now when I say this, but the most important parts of the story usually come from the Japanese words said in the story, namely かたわれ時 (kataware-doki) and むすび (musubi). It is amazing how a whole, coherent story and be created from just these two words alone. The only problem I had with the story is that there were some Deus Ex Machina. That aside, though the story of Kimi no Na wa has some flaws, it still does make for a compelling story. And for that, I like it.
As for the animation, it can't really be summed in just a few words alone. Heck, this film has allowed me to see the most beautiful art and animation in my entire time watching anime. Even ufotable can't even get close to this level of beauty and detail. Some people might say that its expected because of Makoto Shinkai, but I have to say that the studio CoMix Wave Films deserve a big hand for Kimi no Na wa. Every frame is crafted intricately and painstakingly, close to that of tapestry but closer to that of an excellent painting. Considering that this is a movie that seems to run at a higher framerate, the amount of effort put into the animation and art must be enormous. Each scenery in the movie is breath-taking and vibrant, and this isn't even exaggeration. The scenes taken in the city displays Tokyo perfectly as a bustling city, and there is so much detail that it could actually be considered a photograph of the city in real life, if not for the equally well-animated anime characters walking around. The scenes taken in the village gives off a peaceful and serene vibe as well, while the scenes taken in rainy weather seems somewhat melancholic. The animation of the weather in Kimi no Na wa manages to match the characters' feelings as well- rainy in times of sadness and hardship, sunny in times of light-hearted joy and the evening sunset in times of seriousness. But what scenery or is completely lively without sound? 
The music and sound of Kimi no Na wa is outstanding as well. Not just the background soundtrack for individual scenes, but the other sounds such as birds chirping and such. For some particular reason, the detailed animation coupled with the realistic sound does pull you into the show, and for a moment you will be completely oblivious of your surroundings while immersed in the realism of this movie. The music does make everything seem more realistic, even compared to other anime, but what really stands out is Radwimps' insert songs at each individual part of the movie. If I'm correct, the songs are Yumetourou, Zen Zen Zense, Sparkle and Nandemonaiya. The songs really does manage to capture the moment at times with a feeling I honestly and regrettably cannot really describe. It's all going into my YouTube playlist. Definitely. The OST for the movie is also very good, especially the piano pieces in my opinion. The music complements the mood of certain moments in the movie perfectly and appropriately, but in this movie there are certain parts that are void of music, and are for the most part important scenes that require your full attention. As such, I can say that the music and sound of Kimi no Na wa is outstanding and close to flawless. If you have time to spend, go to YouTube to listen to the soundtrack and songs- whether you're studying, relaxing or on the way to or from the workplace, these songs will help to lift your mood.
Lastly, the characters and the cast of Kimi no Na wa- namely the two MCs, Miyamizu Mitsuha and Tachibana Taki (both alliterations, if you notice) are believable, likeable and relatable characters. However, their personalities only manage to show so much due to what I think is the curse of anime films. Because of anime films' short running time, there is the tendency for the characters to have little character development. Though Kimi no Na wa can be considered one of the longer anime films, it is an original and a standalone movie that doesn't have any prequels or foundation to back up the characters. This movie being one of the first few 'original' anime films I've watched, this might be something that just applies to me, but I feel that this fact still requires mentioning. I also have one additional problem with the characters- or more exactly, the side characters who are the friends of the MCs. Since some characters such as Tsukasa didn't get much development, sometimes it is hard to understand why they would go so far for the MCs, both literally and metaphorically. They usually show little to no resistance when told to do something, even if that 'something' is a very serious deed that actually requires some form of consideration. All that being said, I still find the characters of Kimi no Na wa much to my liking- they are portrayed very realistically through their individuality, their simple uncomplicated relationships with each other and their individual hopes and dreams of their own. 
Though the characters are well-written but are slightly flawed, they are not exactly Kimi no Na wa's strong point and would be much better if more time were spent on it. It is, however, definitely an improvement from 5 Centimetres per Second, in which some characters were incomprehensible. For the characters in Kimi no Na wa, there is definitely room for improvement.
Did I enjoy Kimi no Na wa? I'm sure I did. Time and time again, I was pushed to the edge of my seat while watching it. The humour made me laugh at times (especially the statements made by Yotsuha) and the touching scenes made me realise that I had a heart. My eyes were constantly glued to the screen- and believe me, when watching Kimi no Na wa, toilets and full bladders won't matter! I think I also enjoyed this film because of the unexpected but essential sci-fi elements that were introduced into the movie, which were also much to my liking.
Lest I forget, I also want to give an additional shout-out to the voice actors, especially the ones playing the MCs. After doing a little bit more research, I found out that the seiyuu are pretty new to the voice acting industry, with the girl voicing Mitsuha only 18 years old! The voice actors have done a superb job at voicing the characters, and never have I heard other voice actors voice their characters with that degree of emotion. Furthermore, because of the gender-swapping phenomenon that happens, the voice actor also has to start altering their voice a little, and that was also well-done. It was fun watching certain parts in which the seiyuu of the MCs had to act a little bit more like the opposite sex because of the phenomenon. I've to say that the other voice actors and actresses of the side characters also performed well, especially those voicing the other members of the Miyamizu family.
Overall, Kimi no Na wa is a masterpiece with excellent voice acting, great story, exceedingly outstanding art and sound and good character. Everyone who watches this film will definitely enjoy it to some extent, and some might even shed a tear or two. Personally, this film has exceeded my expectations and is currently the best film I have watched so far. I sincerely hope that Makoto Shinkai's next film will be equally as good or better, and I hope that his next film might be the first anime to make me tear up. This is a weird wish...
Edit: Having rewatched the film in its entirety again, I noticed a few more things in the movie. Rewatching the film makes it lose its ""magic"", and since I already knew what would happen I could pay attention to plot details I missed on my previous watch. This made me realise that even though the movie is mostly understandable, the main aim of the movie is to be like a nakige- to mess up your emotions. As a result, since the second run didn't give me much feels and my judgement was not impaired, it could be seen that some plot elements were not very well explained, which still made the movie slightly confusing even after watching it again. However, I still think that this is still the best anime film I've watched so far this year.
I still have not watched Koe no Katachi yet as of this time.
Second edit: Having watched the film for the third time in its entirety (yes, I'm that crazy but the film was just released in my country and I felt like watching it in the cinema in high definition and surround sound instead of kissanime's current native 480p resolution) I yet again realised a few more things, SPOILERS AHEAD.
Many people might ask, why did Taki and Mitsuha forget about each other? It seemed more like a plot device to keep the plot going and emotions flowing. Though I can't really argue with that, the reason for this is also because of the concept introduced (which is pretty true in fact) that dreams fade after you wake up. Everyone always had that one morning when you wake up and think ""Hey, I just had a dream but I just can't seem to recall what I was dreaming about."" The 'dream' in the movie was attributed to the body switching, and after the 'waking up' was triggered (the grandma asking Taki if he was dreaming) it is only right for the memories of the 'dream' to linger around only for a short while before disappearing. Even so, certain triggers in memory might lead you to remember part of the dream and feel a certain sense of déjà vu. Keeping that in mind, you might still retain a part of the memory of the dream for a while, though that memory is fated to eventually be forgotten, which is exactly what happened in Kimi no Na wa.
Additionally, the fact that Taki was able to challenge impossible odds and travel back in time to become Mitsuha again and save Itomori could be interpreted as nothing short of a Deus Ex Machina- which similarly to my previous analysis is in fact a Deus Ex Machina but has a deeper meaning to it. 'Musubi ' is the reason. This 'musubi' is supposed to be a concept of 'connections' in a certain sense, or as the characters would say, something that unravels, intertwine and connects together again. Because of this concept, I am able to interpret it as this : though their timelines weren't in step, Taki was able to change the past because of the shrine god's power (musubi) and this effectively allowed 'the timeline Taki was in' connected to 'the timeline where Mitsuha died' to unravel and reconnect again instead to the morning of 'Itomori's final day in which Mitsuha was still alive and had time to do something about the impending disaster.' This is how it makes sense to me and this is how I interpret it, after a second rewatch.
-SPOILER END-
SUMMARY = 45/50 or 9/10 (Personally, I feel like giving it a ten though)
+ Good story with interesting concept
+ SUPERB art, voice acting and sound
+ Character all have black hair. Finally. And they're pretty realistic.
- Not enough character development for some, due to movie duration.
- 1 or 2 Deus Ex Machina
- Though mostly understandable, some plot elements are not completely explained or not explained enough, which might make the film quite confusing for first-time viewers
+- Not good for the heart, because of the feeling of emptiness that comes after you watch it.

                I've only written a few reviews on this site for anime that I hold dear to my heart. I can only say one thing about this movie: it is one of the best movies I have seen. EVER!
Yes it is cheesy, yes it has teens as the main character, and yes it is in the Romance/Slice of Life genres. Though this movie takes those usually cut and dry mushy gushy cliques, and turns them on their head.
Characters
8.5/10
 Though I loved this movie, there is only one place I see this lacking. It isn't because I hate the characters or anything, I actually love them. The
                  only thing I can say about these characters, is that both the main characters are already good people all around with no need for character development. Yes both Mitsuha and Taki start off kinda disliking each other, but they do grow into loving the other and going to the great far and beyond. There isn't really a great antagonist either, besides Mitsuha's father whose just a grade-A asshole, but even he in his own way comes through in the end. That's the only downfall about the characters, is that all characters, main and supporting, are just great people. But that's another thing that makes it wonderful is how all the characters come together for one of the greatest plot twists and endings of all time.
Art
9/10
Oh my god, this is probably some of the best work to come from Makoto Shinkai. I've seen all of his films, but this is just a whole other level. Backgrounds in almost every shot is like it's own moving painting. Especially since many of the areas are drawn after actual places in Japan. While Makoto Shinkai did all of the directing and such, Masayoshi Tanaka did his BEST work in character design. His work in both Anohana, another favorite of mine, as well Waiting in Summer, are brilliant, but this one takes it. All of the characters, despite not having crazy colored hair all look drastically different from each other. He matches their design to who they are as characters perfectly. This whole movie is just a eyegasm.
Sound
9/10 
If you have seen this movie, you know now that every time you hear any of the soundtrack from this movie, it will take you back to that place all over again. Your Name was fully composed by  lead singer and songwriter of Radwimps, Noda Yojiro. Though he hasn't really been involved in any other anime works as of  yet, his debut as a head composer is nothing but brilliant. 
Zenzenzense, Supākuru, and Nandemonaiya are a perfect head set piece for this movie. I am so glad that Tananka requested Yojiro, because I feel like no one could have blended all the vibes, feelings, as well as the art into the sound as well as these two men.
Story
8.5/10
Your Name starts off like any other romance drama with a scifi twist. Yes it can be kinda smothered in cliques at times, but it does one thing that other in this drama doesn't. It gives us a plot twist as well as a good ending. While many of the scientific aspects of this movie are left unanswered at the end, at the same time we really don't want to know why all of it happened, just that we are so happy that it did. You have a typical body switchers romance comedy, but unlike usual plots similar this both Taki and Mitsuha are fully aware of the other very early on. I know what you're thinking, ""why don't they just go find each other after they switch back,"" well thats where the glorious plot twist comes in and makes it wayyyy less simple then it previously seemed. Plus unlike 5 Centimeters Per Second, let's just say they both turn around.
Enjoyment/Overall
9.5/10
This is one of those movies that will make you laugh, and cry all at once. You'll be so sad at times just hoping this will end well, and you'll be so happy that it does! It'll make you want more but, at the same time it'll make you feel completely satisfied with everything.",9,therushgirl13

                Before I begin, this is my first review on this site. This is one of the first anime movies (or shows, let me assure you) that I have ever seen. 
What prompted me to write this review was that I saw a lot of reviews that began somewhere along the lines of 'I saw this ranked #1 and watched it to see what the fuss was about...' '...but it's generic and boring with little character development.' But don't let the 'anime superfans' get you.
As a 3rd year film studies major, the character development was simple, yes. On the surface level, it followed many of the
                  tropes that you can see in the genre. But what caught my attention was how it led to that. The attention to detail, the small little nuances in the voice acting- it was masterfully crafted and well-done. As someone with a little knowledge about the Japanese culture, Shinkai successfully delivers character development through a genius (in my opinion) method of invoking the topics of childhood naivety, curiosity, and Japanese culture. 
I can say for sure this film is the equivalent to a Pixar masterpiece. It skillfully manages to deliver a basic plot in the form of a lovable and enjoyable film using its beautiful animations and design.

                ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***
Now, to start off:
At first, this film may not seem all too interesting and it may appear to be just a standard “romance” animation between two characters - I was starting to think that at first, but I don’t mind things like that anyway. However, this film is definitely worth putting in the effort to watch all of it; this is because it transforms into one hell of a film. Personally, I find the thought of swapping bodies with each other both amusing and also quite interesting as well as the silly antics that the two protagonists get up to as soon
                  as they realise that they have swapped bodies; I loved how they interacted with their family and friends and I found it sweet how traditional Mitsuha and her family were.
However, this where the film takes a dark turn which I was so shocked to see but I also loved it at the same time; this is where the film begins to get really good but also really sad at the same time. As I mentioned, the first premise of the film highlights how the two protagonists react when they find out that they occasionally swap bodies whenever they wake up in the morning and then they start to tease each other as well as laugh and have fun; but this is the last bit of their happiness.
When Taki goes to try and visit her for the first time, he finds out the place she lived was no longer - many people thought that was delusional for this, but the “place” that she “lived” was just a massive crater due to the fact that a meteor had hit it three years earlier killing upwards of 500+ inhabitants (almost a third at the time).
This is evidently quite a shock to Taki because he always thought that they were just interacting with each other in real time, but no, he was swapping bodies with a girl who lived 3 years ago. Ergo, Taki then tries his best to try and save her - he tries to do this by by managing to swap bodies with her one last time in an attempt to warn the inhabitants that the meteor is going to split in two and that extra bit that fell off will devastate their local districts. In attempt to do this, he also visits the shrine in which Mitsuha and her sister lay “a part of themselves” for them to come back to this realm after they were gone. Well, this worked because they managed to see each other via the use of “twilight” (also known as “golden hour”); however, as they get closer to saving each other, they begin to forget each other’s names - they know that they must save someone special to them, but they just cannot remember their names (hence the name of the film, “Your Name”). Mitsuha could have gotten their districts saved a while sooner, but her dad refused to listen to her (who is the mayor of their town/village). After failed attempts at getting people to leave, we finally see the meteor crashing down into the village and destroying everything in its path - sad music plays at the time, I honestly thought they had failed (I believe that’s what the producers were wanting us to think).
Honestly, my review does NOT do this film enough justice; no wonder it is the highest grossing animated film in Japan (Japanese anime film, that is) to date. This film’s story is both comical yet absolutely heart-wrenching and it certainly had me in tears at the end of it because I didn’t think they would.",10,Anyi_lizethBuwan

                already half way with this movie, I felt like I was going to cry. Then the tsunami of my tears was summoned. This movie may not be as good as I say, but it's good overall. I love the suspense created at the end of the movie, just the heart throbbing scenes were enough for me. I dislike the fact that the people forget about their most precious familiars(like hell this is hard not to spoil). Just like meteors, or shooting stars dancing in the sky, once admired and then forgotten.
My face red, my ears burning, my legs shaking,  and the beat of my
                  heart tightening my chest, totally mesmerized by the beauty of the scenery as the stars wove parallel across the sky. The beauty of their metaphor was beyond, it taught me a little bit of philosophy. Overall, it's a good movie to watch for anybody who wants an anime with a slice of life with some spice added in.",9,aroundTHElotus

                ""Your Name."" 
One of the best anime I have ever experienced as well as some of the best cinematography in any animated film. Nothing is perfect, but ""Your Name really hits home to the point where I want to say it is flawless. A simplistic yet complex story that will make you laugh, smile, angry and cry no matter how many times you watch it. Shinkai has really stepped it up since Garden of Words.
""Your Name"" includes some of the most beautifully vibrant and colorful animation, a very large attention to detail, breathtaking panning shots, an incredibly immersive atmosphere and a great score to truly
                  tie it all together. The music is so well produced and each track is placed perfectly throughout. Yamada You and Shinkai worked with RADWIMPS on the soundtrack during production and both the english and japanese tracks work so well with the material.
The amount of layers that ""Your Name"" contains makes it even more lovable. From it's characters, plot complexity and the narrative that drags you back and forth, the story is loaded with foreshadowing and a tragedy that reminds me of classic tales and modern renowned stories. The first half of the movie you get to learn and fall in love with the characters and then the second half you just feel so heavily for everything going on and it's almost as if you are swapping places yourself!
Makoto Shinkai, I personally thank you for giving the world this incredible gift.",9,SimplyCosmo

                This is the first time I take so much time to write a review, and it's certainly not a smart choice to do so right after watching the movie, as tears are not dried up on my f-ing face.
Of course, I came to this movie because of its grade on MAL, because everyone is praising it, and because I was seeking some beautiful amimation. Go see the trailer and you will absolutely want to see every piece of the full work.
I am not familiar with work of the director, and I don't usually watch full-lenght anime movies other than Miyazaki's (yeah, I don't have any
                  personnality), so I won't be able to judge it within his career. Let's get started:
 _ Story: 9.
The story is simple but it's not a bad thing. It expands itself, and seems really belivable, which a great qulity for this kind of story. I will be short, because I don't want to spoil anything, but as the story goes on, you'll find more and more depth to the scenario that you would ahave expected from a romantic comedy. You'll laugh and cry like a b*tch, that's the only thing I can assure you regarding the story.
 _ Art: 10.
Quick one also. This is probably the best looking animation I've ever seen. Everything from the lights, camera movements, character depiction, hair, bodies, sceneries, sun, leaves, wind, cities and mountains is outstanding. If you like Japanese animation, you have to watch this, and come to the evidence that we live in a wonderful time as for amition technology. You can see that everything is hand-drawn, and yet it's flawless, smooth. 
I hope it sets a new bar for animation, so I can live again something of this intensity.
 _ Sound: 9.
I'm not good when it comes to sound. What is a good soundtrack, the one that you keep noticing because it's so good ? Or the one you don't even notice because it suits so well to the atmosphere of the movie ? I'll with the second I think, but this movie does both.
The general atmosphere is really great and team up well with the animation, but we have a couple of songs and montage during the course of the movie, and I wasn't really convinced by it. Maybe it's taste, but I would have prefere the soundtrack without them, I guess.
 _ Character: 8.
Well, it's my lowest grade, but 8 is still great right ? The character are depicted really well, and were believable, but now that I come to think of it, they had no distinctions, they sorely exists through their interactions. And it's kind of impressive to make the audience care for ""bland"" characters, because as the story goes on, I would have sell my entire family to come help them. 
Second thing, one of the montage I talked about is actually about the building of the relationship between the two MC, so this important plot device is actually 3min long, but maybe it just spared us washed up Freaky Friday gags, I don't know. I feel like it would have deserved more screen time. 
 _ Enjoyement: 10.
I cried 3 times. Period. When it comes to the animes which touched me the most, I think about the ones where I cried, even though I usually goes for drama of romantic. That's why I'll say Clannad AS, AnoHana, Angel Beats, and now of course Kimi no Na Wa.
 _ Overall: 10.
For the first half I just thought this was going to be a feel-good movie, but it expanded itself and became something that I will probably consider one of my best anime experince in my life. Even though the story seems simple and the character are not as expanded as you could hope, maybe in 20 years it will be considered ugly and boring, but it cannot erase the feeling I have right now, 30min after the end, still smiling, happy about the choices that drove me here to witness this. It's a bit too much, when I see the grades and the reviews, I don't think I am the only one thinking that.
If you have the opportunity to wtach this, go ahead, you won't regret it.
I hope this review will help people ! Have a good day, sorry for bad english and typos",10,BigBangParty

                Usually i either skip any high school romance flick or i start watching and get bored 5 to 10 minutes in. This is why i came into this movie with very low expectation despite what the reviews where telling, but oh boy was this a surprise. Would have never guessed this would become one of my favorite movies. 
When looking at the characters and story alone out of context there isn't much special to be seen here. It starts out with your typical awkward teenagers getting put in awkward situations, then in the second half it does get a lot more interesting but still not
                  a mind blowing story from there on out. Simply not a perfect story but good enough to enjoy.
But when combining the story and characters with the rest that's when it gets real. First of the art, it is amazing. It is the most beautiful anime I've ever seen and some scenes even rival paintings. The animation is also really well done and makes each scene and character really feel alive. Combining this with the very well timed soundtracks and great voice acting it is just excellent, even if the story would be awful it would still be worth a watch just for that!
So ye if you enjoy high school romance go and watch it! If you enjoy beautiful visual and audio go and watch it! If you enjoy both then i don't get it why you are still here!",10,bramve

                Never in all my time of watching anime have I been so moved by a story. There's something about this one that just makes remember things from some time ago (as is a theme of the movie) 
TL:DR version 
Kimi no Na wa is a fantastic movie from both a objective and a personal standpoint the way the movie uses imagery and symbolism is astounding as well as its way of sudeley telling you about the movie's plot before it reveals it to you (If your looking.)
Longer version 
Kimi no Na wa is a movie that uses imagery and symbolism to convey a story that
                  is utterly astounding, It's subtle way of conveying more mature themes through the use of imagery is something that I enjoy in anime, however you don't need to grasp all these themes in order to have a great time with this movie. I think the thing that most grips me about this film is its way of making you expect something to happen, and then totally mislead you but you still end up feeling like that's what you wanted. Some of us can probably relate to the characters in the film, either it be with Taki's always frantic schedule or with Miyamizu's completely boring life. Point is everyone has someone they can relate to. (I wont go into the characters that much as there development is quite important in the story and would dive into spoiler territory) The Development of these characters is one of the best I've seen in anime, pretty much ever. 
Kimi no Na wa has stolen the top spot away from full metal Alchemist and rightly so. I must admit I never thought I'd see the day where something would top it, I new it would come though and whatever did would be fantastic and well I was right. THis anime does such a phenomenal job with everything in it and I wouldn't even hesitate to recommend it to anyone.",10,Jackrabbitor
32281,"
                I never never write reviews, but for this movie I had absolutely no choice I had to share how wonderful it is. Kimi no Na wa (your name) is an absolute masterpiece!
Story:
I loved the story from the very beginning. The concept is simple enough, everyone can grasp it from the start or even by just reading the synopsis. I liked the idea of the switch between the two characters, but that it is only half-conscious, they don't know that they are actually switching places and only think they are dreams. This genre is also not usually my cup of tea, but somehow I ended up
                  loving this movie. My eyes were full of tears at some point and I was trying very hard to not to cry. I really liked how the story is a kind of take on fate and destiny and how the lives of different people can be intertwined.
Art:
I really enjoyed the art stye in this movie. Everything was drawn beautifully with lots of details. All of the characters are also very awesome, it is not like in some animes where the secondary characters seem to have been just a second thought and drawn as such. I loved the landscapes, they seemed very realistic and they were really beautiful to look at.
Sound:
The sound was also very amazing. I liked all of the background music and I really enjoyed how it blend itself to the main storyline, it just matched perfectly what was happening on screen.
Characters:
I really liked the characters and I feel like they were easy to relate to. Everyone can see a bit of themselves in both of them, the struggles of high school and being a teenager in general to family issues or hating your life and wanting nothing more but to get out. However, I also feel like for the major part of the show, they don't have a lot of depth to them. They are very basic and cliche with next to no backstory that can make you feel as you actually know them rather then just seeing them on a show. 
Overall:
In sum, I really enjoyed this movie. At first I was not sure it would be my type of movie, but I can happily say that I was very mistaken. This is one of the best things I have watched in a very long time. To everyone out there, you should definitely put an hour and forty five minutes aside to watch this as it is a masterpiece. Even if you don't really think you will enjoy it, I ask of you to truly reconsider and give it a chance. I know I did and I absolutely do not regret it! In fact, I would probably have regretted it had I not watched it.",9,Limefrogz97

                Kimi no Na wa. In English, ""Your Name'. This beautifully drawn anime chronicles the events that occur to two teens, living on opposing sides of the ""train tracks"" of life. Mitsuha, a small town girl who longs to feel the pulse of bustling Tokyo, and Takashi, a Tokyo boy who struggles to realize his dream of being an architect while juggling a part time job and school. Both experience a strange phenomenon that allows them to change bodies. 
This starts a chain of events that will leave nothing quite like it was.
Story: 9
The story left a profound impact on me. It made me realize the
                  impact of the fragments of dreams we barely remember, and what power memories have. At times, I was a little unclear as to who was who, but it was quickly explained, leaving me enough time to understand and enjoy the story more because of it.
Art: 10
The art may be the best part of the whole film. It is breathtaking, mixing beautiful colors and imagery to create a stunning backdrop to the story. This may honestly be my favorite artwork in any anime that I have seen. 
Sound: 10
There is a fantastic use of music and silence in this one. The exchanges of art and sound in this film helped complement everything in it. The sound was there to enhance the story, and it backed off to let the images do the talking. Wonderful, and completely deserving of a ten.
Character: 10
The characters were very well developed, and relatable. I felt sucked into their world, and I deeply cared about their fears and dreams. I wanted them to succeed, and I felt their triumphs and defeats. I felt like they could walk into my house at any time.
Overall: 10
It's no secret that I loved this from the opening scene. I loved the characters, the art, the music, everything that this had to offer. I loved the symbolism of the trains, I loved this wistful and bittersweetness of it all. It kept me laughing and crying, and left me stunned until the credits stopped rolling.

                OVERALL
This movie was all about the feels. It will make you laugh, & at time you will find yourself on the verge of tears. Most of all, when the end credits roll, the bittersweet aftertaste will linger on.
To be honest, before this I wasn't a big fan of Makoto Shinkai. Sure, his movie visuals were always stunning. But the plots failed to excite me most of the time. Then I saw the trailer for Kimi no Na wa & couldn't help but feel hopeful. Kimi no Na wa is his best work, & I'm looking forward to see how he will be able to top
                  this in the future.
STORY
I had high expectations before watching Kimi no Na wa, & I was not let down. It started off as being your typical rom-com (which was pleasant enough in its own right), before you get hit hard by the feels train.
The different plot lines in the movie were meticulously & almost flawlessly interwoven. Seemingly meaningless details were scattered throughout the first half of the movie, leading to the big ""gasp"" moment of realisation at the end. & boy, was THAT delivered well. Sure there were some discrepancies here & there, but c'mon, who cares about logic! It's a movie about body swapping!
ART
What can I say about this that hasn't already been said already? This has always been Makoto Shinkai's strong point, & he delivered yet again.
SOUND
The voice acting. The soundtrack. Everything was on point, adding to the whole feel of the movie.
CHARACTER
Loved each & every character in this movie.
If I had to nitpick, it would be the lack of relationship development between the protagonists. But then again, this was a 90-minute movie, not 24 episodes worth of anime.
ENJOYMENT
Yes yes yes. Would recommend it even to someone who doesn't usually watch anime.",10,Hanabirachi
32281,"
                An absolutely stunning masterpiece.
Anime won't feel that same after watching this.
Makoto Shinkai didn't miss with this one. In my opinion, his best work. I've seen Weathering with You, but I believe this one is more interesting and enjoyable.
Sound:
The music by RADWIMPS is wonderful. The songs slap, they go from upbeat and hype songs, to more emotional songs. They fit this movie perfectly. If you watch this movie, the songs are probably one of the most memorable bits of this whole experience. They go hand in hand with the visuals, and make the movie so great.
Character:
The characters in the movie are loveable and relatable. Taki, a
                  regular teenage boy living in Tokyo. Many of the people watching can relate to him. And Mitsuha, a girl living in the Japanese countryside, not content with her lifestyle and wishes to move to Tokyo. These characters don't bring the movie down. I have noticed a trend among many animes, where if a character is unlikeable, it makes the show harder to watch. This is not the case. The characters work with the shows aesthetic and are written into the show perfectly. Shinkai did well.
Enjoyment:
I greatly enjoyed this film. Many say it is sad, but it is just very emotional.
Overall:
10/10.
Definitely recommend watching this one.",10,mattblamey

With a huge success on Japanese soil Your Name allows Makoto Shinkai to stage a dream story that will gradually see the daily life of two characters jostled. He tackles many themes through different genres (science fiction, fantasy, humor, drama ...), but knowing how to lead and master his story, managing to bring out the emotion and
                  the richness of the protagonists and stakes. It is also a dive into the Japanese lifestyle that he proposes, highlighting a modern Japan facing the more traditional one (several sequences are also memorable, like the manufacture of Sake), with a face bruised by recent disasters resonating regularly.
Defying time, Your Name turns out to be a beautiful fable where we take pleasure to follow the protagonists and hiding themes sometimes more complex than they seem. A sweet melancholy is slowly settling and the atmosphere is all along taking even haunting, the story is beautiful as the idea of ​​sharing bodies that are never met while Makoto Shinkai takes his time to develop well characters and issues, allowing you to focus on the protagonists and immerse yourself in the heart of the story.
We can still blame the work a last part a little less well managed, too slow and not highlighting the emotion that there should be. It's a shame because the work was really well mastered until then, but it does not become harmful either as the melancholy fragrance floating on Your Name remains addictive. Makoto Shinkai also shows a particular attention to details, here exciting, and offers many plans (and sequences, including humorous) memorable and beautiful while the work has a certain aesthetic and graphic quality, and sometimes sublime.",10,Miranox_x

                The most beautiful piece I have ever seen in my entire life. 
[Preface]
This is my first review ever and although I have completed around 150 seasons of anime (and probably more) this is only the 4th time I have given a rating of 10. That said, I don’t want to review anime with the same critical analysis as I might a literary piece in a traditional scholarly environment. I’m going to write this review in a straightforward stream of conscience. The main ideas will be put into brackets at the start of each paragraph.
It is not enough to say that this piece was refreshing or
                  innovative. Kimi no Na wa captures every element and trope of anime that is to be loved. It reminds us of why we started watching anime and why we still watch anime.  It brings us back to the basics, the little things we find enduring. It sets a new standard, a new tone for what we can consider a masterpiece in anime.
[Actual Review]
[These characters will be real to you.]
The characters in this piece are developed so beautifully, so intricately that you will often find yourself thinking back on your life. You might laugh as you recount the times you spent with your grandmother or burn with frustration as you relate to the social anxiety of the two main characters. These personalities are accessible. Truly characters that you absolutely fall in love with. These characters are friendly, cute, cool, inspiring, exciting, bold, and anything else you could love in a person. 
[Every single aspect of the plot folds exquisitely into each other.]
The plot was surprising. This anime is so much more than you think it is. In anime we often expect and unfortunately find that the plots are linear in nature. We can predict with ease what is to come and if we can’t predict the plot it’s often because the anime has brought in some nonsensical plot twists just to be surprising. Kimi no Na wa eases you into a vibrant reality with plot twists that make you feel like you should have seen it coming but for some reason didn’t. Imagine trying to solve a puzzle. Each piece is carefully guided into place until you are left with no guidance and realize that you hold in your hand the final piece. 
[Music is brilliant.]
The tone of the music for this anime is top tier, absolutely amazing. Each soundtrack sets just the right tone for the right moment for the right environment. Nothing short of brilliance in selection and composition. You’ll just have to hear it for yourself. In fact, one of the reasons I was so excited to see this movie was because I heard the amazing soundtrack beforehand.
[THE FEELS ARE REAL]
The anime will tug your heart in every direction. This anime leaves nothing to chance, every push and pull of emotion is intentional. It’s done very well, positioned and paced perfectly in a way that makes the anime both enjoyable and impressionable. Your heart will move for these characters. 
[Artwork is beautiful.]
I think nobody can deny that Kimi no Na wa has some beautiful art that is able to visually present a story that is captivating. However, personally I don’t think art is too important. When I first started watching anime I thought it was one of the most important aspects but now I think paying this too much focus is the wrong approach. Yes, when we look at anime like unlimited art plays a critical role in its success. However, there is so much more to the value of anime that is more inherent and timeless than art.
[CONCLUSION: There is a lot of depth to this anime.]
What do I mean by depth? Well if you watch this anime you will immediately be able to tell. There is more to be said about this anime than can realistically be put to words in the span of this review which is intended for a relatively short read. Just know that overall this anime offers an incredible amount in its vivacity. It takes from life some of its greatest themes and carefully maneuvers it into a story, a masterpiece. This anime is not simply a movie; it is an experience.",10,foerever

                Kimi no NA wa ( Your Name ) exceeded my every expectation from what i had. Initially i was just excited for some fantastic animation,feels,music and good storytelling, which is a lot but this movie threw in some elements of time, supernatural, psychology and emotion and blended it beautifully. there are no pacing issues, excellent dialogue, good lighthearted music throughout the film, comedy wherever required. Hell, i can't find any flaw with this, this is definitely Shinkai's best. i have nothing but praise for him. i hope he never stops what he does and continues to give us stellar projects like this.

I have watched many other movies such as five centimeters per second and the girl who leapt through time etc. However none of them had ever left me at the edge of my seat throughout watching the movie unlike this one. 
Story 10
Completely original story and I must applaud for the amazing plot twists
                  that led me wanting to watch more of it. Although it lacked the element of surprises, it still made me very interested in what will happen next. I was watching this with my friend throughout and whenever they explain what had happened (no spoliers), I would be screaming my heads off at how amazing the story was crafted. Easy to understand and most importantly very beautiful crafted with no confusion on what was going on
Art 10
One word: AMAZING. As I said earlier, the art was one of the main reasons why I was so hyped for this show. Throughout the show, the character designs, the landscapes and the scenery was absolutely breathtaking. The use of colors made the show appear very comforting and beautiful. Even the shots of certain scenes eg. The city shots were VERY well detailed and realistic. This is what I call QUALITY artwork XD. 
Sound 9
The main song for this show is Zen Zen Zense by RADWIMPS. When I first heard the song,I found it very addicting and especially loved the chorus. You should definitely listen to it! The song is very fitting to the show. And to be even more impressed is the music they use at certain situations are PERFECT. It fits the atmosphere and actually brings out the emotions of the scenes through music which was very amazing. It doesn't get a 10 maybe because It isn't as emotional as what people would expect since RADWIMPS is sort of a rock band (in a sense). But it does give the show life as this is NOT A SAD STORY.
Character 8 
If you are looking for big changes in character developments. This is not the show for that. The characters Taki and Mitsuha are well elaborated enough on their past, feelings and emotions to understand what is going on especially since it's only close to a two hour movie. 
However to actually have the feeling of being attached to the character or to 'grow' with them throughout the show wasn't quite shown in the movie (This isn't an anime series ya know). Furthermore, the side characters were also not given much in-depth characteristics as much as the main characters. But overall, It was really touching to see the amount of characterization of all the touching scenes. I teared up at some QQ
Enjoyment Perfect 5/7... Jk 10
I would say personally, this is the best movie I have seen in my life. The story was simply stunning. Throughout the show watching it with my friend through Skype, I was constantly telling him how amazing this show was. There were some points where they actually explained what was going on and boom, a plot twist which BLOWS MY MIND AT HOW WELL THEY CRAFTED IT. I waited 9 months for this show since the release of the first trailer and waited eagerly for this day to come. And the most amazing part of it, It was worth the wait. I smiled throughout the show and was so WOWed at it that I wished it never ended. Mind blowing and Beautiful are the two words I will describe the show. Definitely an amazing piece of work. 
Overall 10
If you are a fan of Shinkai's works, I would arguably say this is his best piece yet. If you are a fan of watching beautiful stories and breathtaking artworks. This is the show for you, currently while writing this, Kimi no na wa is sitting at first in the Anime Movies list and I would like to say, it is not a lie. Out of all the movies I have seen in my life, be it real life movies or anime movies, this is still the best one I have watched so far. If you asked me, what could be improved? Based on the movie and the story, it is already a masterpiece itself.

                Just finished watching this and... just wow.
I'm not really a fan the drama genre but this was really worth watching. The complicated but beautiful story made me playback some of the scenes to keep in track on what's really happening  but once you get to realize what was indeed happening, you'll just be amazed. Also, the idea of (spoiler)""body switching""(spoiler) was not just the same with Kokoro Connect but set in an unexpected manner.
The artworks and sceneries, though simple, were just beautiful. The most beautiful of them all was the comet, from its appearance to its splitting, amazing. The idea of a distant love
                  combined with these elements were just spectacular. 
My problem was, as I stated, the complicated storyline which made me repeat scenes and browse spoilers to keep up on what's happening. Lastly is the characters, not the entirety of them, but it just felt like they're not much explored enough to feel a sense of emotional attachment towards them. Aside from those, (y)

                This movie is a masterpiece in terms of Art and Sound. If you want to see one of the best ever art in an anime, then this movie is a must pick. I rated this movie 10 (masterpiece) because of its art. In terms of story, I have seen better. But it's quite good about 7 in 10.
I wanted to see this anime and ""Koe no Katachi since 2016 and I have waited a year and an half to finally finish watching both. I just had to bring up the name of ""Koe no Katachi"" because this movie being directed by a great director got
                  super hype and advertisement which affected ""Koe no Katachi"". But if you compare the two, you would definitely put ""Koe no Katachi"" way ahead of ""Kimi no Na wa"" in terms of story and characters and the art is quite on the same level.
Actually the story of ""Kimi no Na wa"" is very plain and simplistic. And if you think of the movie only from the story perspective, its actually clever mix up of some cliche themes in anime.
If you are looking for a great anime to watch and you haven't watched this one, then watch it definitely. The story is a bit down, but the spectacular and the grandiose art will mesmerize your brain the whole time that you won't realize it until you have finished watching in one go and calmed down from the exitement.",9,Sadi-st_Tanmoy

                ""What´s your name?""(May contain spoilers.)
It probably involves beauty around it. 
This is it; Kimi No Na Wa(Your name) comes an important part of what made the year 2016 excelent for anime with the likes of MHA, Re-Zero,Mob Psycho and of course the greatest ever, KOE NO KATACHI. Its been 4 years since its release but i wish it would be availible at the movies or to be 2016 again; with its scenery and music combined, it would probably be one of the best times in my life.
The story is confusing. Given its about one girl and one guy switching bodies all the time and one
                  begins to act like the other and suddenly they are the same back again made me wonder if i was delusional or the movie was that difficult to get. But continuning the movie, one thing stood out. Him finding her, her finding him; the writting on the hands..""Im always looking for something.""
In reality, this movie is all about love. When you think about love, its mostly wonders which is what the movie is trying to tell; it bonds people. The never ending feeling that you´re missing something. 
Besides its wonderful story, the scenery is literally pornography. Everywhere you look, theres care into it. Vibrant colors, shots from every angle...Tokyo specially, looks very VERY detailed; i can´t imagine how much time these guys spent just drawing all those shots, its amazing and i congratulate them.
Art and story are the formula for a spectacular movie. This movie will certinally mark generations to come. It doesn´t have such a deep story as koe no katachi for example but it certinally holds up on its own.

                I am not one to take MAL ratings seriously most of the time, so I do not bother with ratings here usually. However, with Kimi no Na wa taking the number 1 spot in MAL, anime that has an immediate high rating often attracts professional or highly analytical critics from around the world. I felt disturbed that it's called a ""masterpiece"" and so, with checking reviews and ratings ahead of time, I decided to rate this film based on a realistic train of thought, and taking this movie to the real world setting to really see how effective and consistent it is. So if you
                  believe this movie is rated more than it should be, then this review might be just for you.
Immediately, when the movie takes off, it starts off for some time with the usual charade of daily antics and life problems. A bit too cliche but not bad. It does however blend foreshadowing without disturbing the flow of the movie, but it also costs some intricate story elements along the way, which is why the movie is not notably unique.
The issue within the first 30 minutes becomes apparent. Character depth is not very big, and with the MCs' being your average children, the story needs to rely on other ulterior plot devices in order to deploy a strong message. Another case is that if a body switching like that occurs ever, a lot of problems can easily be resolved on a realistic train of thought, especially when the affected persons do not live that far away. Simply go big on the internet, state your location and then wait. And then, when they meet, all they need to do is identify their history and unique hobbies/belongings, and that's it.
This movie is confirmed to be primarily entertainment when the origins of the magical comet relies on grey areas AND it along with its meaning is vaguely tied in with traditional Japanese concepts hinting a rigged plot element. The flow of the movie is well done, and the comedy/social aspect is great. I'm sure these pointers are what attracts millennials. 
The time line of the movie is a great concept, very great concept actually. However, it needs more crafting time because a notable amount of things do not make sense, which is why it is logically loose. The intricacies surrounding the plot is also great and does not have any significant loose ends.
The main problem with the movie is that its main messages are not very applicable in the real world. So what if you know a person's name. Love is not analyzed deep here. There are many kinds of love, and there are a lot of disagreeing opinions of love. But what is love on a consistent basis? Consistency always matters. This movie fails to deliver even its strongest message when examined under full extent. What is the point of a magical adventure if you end up in the same starting point.

                This movie, its not really that type of movie I would watch at first because of the genre, but just for it high place on the top anime list here I had to give it a shot.
The story is really breathtaking, you can really live in to the characters pretty well and understand the feelings they have to eachother.
The art in the movie is just beautiful and landscape is really well made which not all movies/series do much effort to, this is something I really like with all this details.
What the whole movie is about is easy to understand and you learn about each character
                  as the story develops.

                By the time I'm writing this review, the movie is already the most hight-grousing film Japan  surpassing even Spirited Away, this movie is a phenomenon and one of the most praised animated films in recent history, so obviously I would have high expectations about this movie and the worst think about it is it had the potential  to be what everyone is saying -A masterpiece-. But no its not, it may be the most Overrated movie I ever watched. Now that doesn't make it bad, its just okay but again, it had the potential.   
Story:
Okay the start of the movie is
                  one of the best starts and well paced starts i ever watched (for the most part). It explores cultures, the daily life and psychology of the main characters in a way so well made that you get immediately drawn in (not invested tho) by simply saying ""what if this 2 change body every next day"" . 
This is good, no i take it back this is brilliant, its not 1 time, its every next day, and not only that, both of them know they have to live with it so the make rules to protect its others personal life and in the same time making it better for each other, immanent the possibilities you can do with this. Also there is this whole thing about  ""musubi"" (　結び　）which is really interesting and connects okay with the story nd pretty much give the deeper meaning, at least that tries to do.
I hope you like what i said because after that throws its self from a high mounted and splashes it to a million pieces. 
I dont want to get to spoilers but to put it simply the climax (which it start when Taki goes to the girls home town in person) has nothing to do with the build up we had by now. The stakes changes and take a whole diffident direction and almost ruins the film. Anyone who saw this movie n reading this review ask yourselves "" did we really want THIS climax?"".  Personally I believe "" as long as the characters are interesting you don't need a great story"" ( Deadpool for example). Which bring me to the second problem of the movie. 
Characters:
Okay lets just say Mitsuha is well made and flawless, I can believe that, but what about Taki? He seem so invested towards to Mitsuha but you don't really feel it, in fact ( miner spoiler) he fells in love with here and you don't even see that happening, hr friend says "" oh you're in love"" and that how we know he's in love with her. This won't be a real problem if his main motivation wasn't  that and the side characters where actually well made. Seriously! there just there, helping the friend in need no questions ask, no juice, not taste what so ever. There feel plain and cliché (heck! there is ever the most typical stereotype of bully in). Don't even make me  mention the climax again.  
Never the less, the things that are good a really good, (which it the idea) and it may not be that big waste of time in the end but i don't believe this i a movie you want to see over and over ( Its pretty forgettable actually).
People, I know you love this movie and i can see why but let me ask you something. Do you like to have the most gourmet and expansive sea food with the cheapest red wine? RED!!

                This is actually my first review, mostly because of my English is not really good. But after I seen ""Kimi no Na wa"", I simply must write one. 
You for sure read the synopsis so I will not write any. Story maybe lack some surprises, but overall it was really nice and make my heart feel warm. Especially when main characters start to cry because of they can´t remember a really important thing.
Maybe I imagine ending a bit different, but I still get really nice feelings from it.

The music is a masterpiece, to me the soundrack is one of the best (if not the best) of all time, you can actually find some videos talking about it so you can get all the little details you probably missed.
Characters are good, they fit the story

                Kimi no na wa is another one of those anime where my friends all suggest me to watch it, but I delayed it for a while. This is just another wakeup call to watch good anime sooner. Kimi no na wa is a beautiful story that has a very interesting plot twist, and has some of the best art I have seen. 
Story- The story is touching and is simply fantastic. Because I really do not want to spoil the show for anyone, I cannot discuss some plot points that were really good. The basic show premise is that two people, a boy and a
                  girl, switch bodies at random, and have to live out each others life. One has to deal with the busy city life, and the other has to deal with the boring rural life. The plot will get more complicated than that don't worry. 
Art- The art on this movie is the best art I have seen in any animation I have ever watched. It was so realistic at some points, and also very surreal at others. Regardless, it takes you to Japan and shows you the wonders of nature. 
Sound- The music and sound effects were also top notch. The sound effects of nature really remind me of nature and the music is also very relaxing to listen to. 
Characters- The characters in this show are very good. Most of them are funny, caring, but with some character flaws. They remind me of real people that can exist and are characters I want to be friends with. There are some characters that are reduced to a very flat role, but the other strong characters make up for it. 
Enjoyment- The show's twists and turns allow me to be engaged and connected throughout the duration of the movie. Not only that, but it kept me wanting more.

                Honestly, I feel I could get away with saying ""10/10, go watch it"" for Kimi no Na wa, but I'll do a proper review. This is tied for first for my favourite anime movie, and here are the reasons:
Story: The story in this movie in essence is simple, a boy meets girl story, but it isn't. This movie is so much more than that, it's an anime that can capture raw feelings that are impossible to put into words, and display them in a single movie almost flawlessly. Granted, there may be some kinds of plotholes and such, but I myself have not tried to
                  search for them, as this anime should be appreciated without having to try and go Cinemasins on it. Giving it a 10/10 for story.
Art: The visuals in this anime... I have no words. Shinkai has not let us down in this in the slightest, he has more than delivered in his past endeavours and some say even furthered and perfected past ideas and tasks. Nothing I say hear will be able to do the visuals and art in this anime justice, so I'll leave it at a 10/10.
Sound: The soundtrack for this anime was exemplary. It managed to sync perfectly with the events in the film, and the lyrics, as well as the way the songs were performed, perfectly suited the moods and amplified the scenes in the anime, something many movies and anime series fail in. 10/10.
Character: The characters in this anime may have appeared a bit shallow and 2D in places, but they did not need to be complicated and complex webs of people. I believe that not delving into overly-tragic backstories and incredibly in-depth character developments helped strengthen this movie greatly, not taking time away from the story to have flashbacks or exposition as many others do. 9/10.
Enjoyment: I cannot say it enough, I absolutely loved this anime, as I have most of Shinkai's other works. 10/10.
Overall: There is no question, this deserves a 10/10. It is hard to explain in a review, but the feelings and emotions that this movie could stir up, happiness, love, awe, hope and many others that I cannot even begin to describe, deeper feelings that we don't have names for, is something that makes this anime absolutely exemplary. This anime is a 10/10 from me and I recommend it to absolutely anyone, along with many of Shinkai's other works.",10,Springball64

Every single one of the characters I fell in love with and I feel that relative to each ones screen time and importance to the story we got to know well. The art and animation in this movie is miles above almost anything else i've ever seen. I'm an emotional person and that means I cry in a lot of movies/shows, but this one hit especially hard and I had tears in my eyes almost
                  all the way through the movie and for the last 30 or so minutes I was just sobbing at how beautiful and emotional the movie was. I believe that even if one is not into romance anime or movies in general there is still a good chance that they will enjoy this movie. This movie is also a good anime film to show to people who don't watch anime. One of my favorite anime of all time and around my 5th favorite Movie of all time.

                After seeing that this film had the highest rating on MAL, I decided I had to give it a watch. Although I wasn't disappointed, I have to say it is definitely over-rated. I don't usually write reviews, but after seeing how unfair of a rating this film has, I just had to write one because it slightly annoyed me. No spoilers in here by the way.
Story - 9
I found the concept very interesting, and the events were played out in a nice order. However, only after about 10 minutes into the film you figure out the main mystery. Would have been better to prolong this
                  more. A few people found the plot confusing, I don't understand why though. It's very easy to follow in my opinion.
Art - 8
Very nice to look at, but nothing too original or mind-blowing. The character designs were simple, but the animation was very fluid and the landscapes were beautifully drawn.
Sound - 6
The music was alright, again, nothing new or particularly compelling. Also, the songs were used in quite a strange manner, almost as if they were inserted randomly into the film as music videos. This may have worked for a different type of film, but unfortunately not for this one.
Character - 6
As mentioned before, the character designs were very simple. Nice, but nothing stood out about their appearance or personality. A few of the side characters made me laugh. That's about it really.
Enjoyment - 7
I was really enjoying the film up until around halfway, maybe more. In general, the film was pleasant, had some good tension, but honestly wasn't actually that emotional. Yes, there were a couple moments where my eyes welled up a tiny bit, but there wasn't enough to make me cry. And it's not like I'm one of those people who doesn't cry at films either - I'm usually the one who is crying the most. That's why I was so surprised that I wasn't very upset. I felt like watching an emotional film today, but unfortunately this one wasn't cut out for me.
Overall - 7
Kimi no Na Wa in general is a good film. Pleasant to watch, interesting to think about, but just easygoing in general. If you like those types of films then I think you should watch it, but if you're looking for something super emotional or super interesting, then don't get your hopes up too high for this one.
Also, something that really irritated me about this film was the ending. It wasn't particularly bad, it was just cut off too soon. There wasn't enough closure. Sometimes this is a good thing, but in this film's case it was rather bad. The film just didn't finish with enough impact, when it really could have done. If that were the case, it would have definitely boosted my overall rating up to an 8, possibly even a 9.",7,mikanczowy

                This anime is really something you should watch.
This is an anime that really hits your feelings.
The first time I watched the anime, I really felt something deep inside, because the anime itself is really about romance, mystery and adventure, and i couldn't get enough of it. Everything I have ever watched was really about romance, and more, but this romance really hit me deep inside, because the bond of the main charaters is really something, and they just try to find a solution on trying to find each others, and that thing really is outstanding, and just everything is great on that anime.

                I'll preface this review by mentioning that I tried to temper my expectations for this movie, and tried not to have my expectations too high.  Even taking this into account, I feel that this movie almost felt like Shinkai was testing out what he and his studio could do with a larger scale and budget, and this didn't come out feeling quite right (to me), and as a result, I feel that this was not his best film (I believe there was an interview in which he also stated that he felt the same).  I will include spoilers in this review, so if
                  you don't want spoilers STOP READING.
Story:
I didn't find this story to be particularly original, and at times, it felt a little out there (yes, even for an anime plot).  The concept of a budding romance through the using body swapping has been done to death, though its usage beyond just experiencing slice of life moments was new and kind of fresh.  That being said, the actual crisis of the film (a falling fragment of the comet which would eradicate a small town) felt a little grandiose compared to the overall tone of the rest of the movie.  
The use of the pseudo-time travel plot element was both good and bad in my opinion.  While I was watching, the fact that Taki was investigating an event that had happened three years ago, definitely added to the mystery and ""what the heck"" aspects of the story, but Shinkai literally made zero attempts to actually expand upon the reasoning and mechanics for why this happened.  There was even a moment when Mizuha's grandmother basically commented, ""Oh you get those body swapping dreams too? Your mother and I got those too.  It's some weird s**t"" and that was the end of the conversation besides the brief mention of the Musubi threads earlier in the film.  I also feel like the ""Your name is?"" line felt really forced, and almost seemed like a bad pun, and it just seemed like Shinkai wanted this to become a recurring line at all costs, due to the fact that the memory loss was also never really explained.  Another gripe I had was about how the movie cut when Mizuha went to confront her father, who was a total dick the whole movie, and then is apparently convinced off screen, and then everyone somehow miraculously escaped unscathed despite the fact that the comet fragments were already plummeting towards them at ridiculous speeds (I seriously think that they underplayed how long it probably takes to evacuate even just a section of a small town).
In comparison to the other two Shinkai movies I've watched (5 Centimeters Per Second and Garden of Words), the overall scale this movie attempted to tackle was larger, and I appreciate Shinkai's efforts to develop as a director and expand his repertoire, but I felt that he was both trying to have an epic story while simultaneously trying to have a slice of life film, and it felt like I watched two movies.  And in many ways, that's what this film was:  it was about two characters' stories which aligned tangentially through a twist of fate.  But still, I felt like they could have been tied together much, much better.
Art:
I don't have much to say on this section.  It was a Shinkai film.  I expected stunning visuals, and I got stunning visuals, just as much or maybe even more so than any of his previous movies.  Shinkai always delivers some of the most visually pleasing anime I've seen, and I'd give the visuals for this movie 11/10 if there was that metric on this site.
Sound:
The soundtrack and background music were okay in my book.  The voice acting was good, though I thought it wasn't particularly outstanding.  There weren't any tracks that I found particularly memorable (I generally have not in most Shinkai films, which is one of the reasons why I personally think that Shinkai is still behind Miyazaki, because he doesn't have a Joe Hisaishi).  If anything, I was a little annoyed at times with the usage of the theme song at some points, because I felt like it was way overused and broke up the flow of the movie at times (though it was never terrible).  It just felt like Shinkai was right up in my face about what moments were supposed to be dramatic and shoving the theme song (that I also am not a big fan of) down my throat, trying to tell me how to feel about a moment.
Characters:
To be honest, I never really felt super interested in any of the characters.  For what seems like a movie where the relationships of the main characters is a huge draw, they all seemed rather bland.  The relationship between Taki and Mizuha felt a little forced, like they were barely starting to see each other as friends, and then suddenly it jumped to I will love you forever (plus the added pseudo-time travel elements made their relationship overly complicated).  Though I felt some flashes of chemistry between Taki and Mizuha, I just felt like this time the overall chemistry between the characters was weak, which I feel is strange for Shinkai, since Shinkai's characters have made me feel terrible before they have relationship issues.  Similarly, I felt like none of the supporting cast were all that interesting either:  Mizuha's two friends (whose names I cannot remember) basically just seemed like plot devices in some ways to me (with the boy being the son of the construction head and the girl being in the broadcasting club), and Taki's senpai and friend basically just tagging along to eat food and ask questions to move the plot and romance along.
Part of the reason I think this is the case is because of how the story is constructed.  Because Shinkai had to devote so much time to splitting the story and setting in half, it felt like we only saw snapshots of the characters, and Taki and Mizuha never really got to interact on a truly meaningful level, or in a way which helped develop their characters significantly since they basically communicated with each other via post-it notes (which can be effective, but I didn't think was done well in this case) and groping each other's privates.

Though I might have criticized a number of things, I did enjoy watching Kimi no Na Wa a lot, and part of that was because of how different it felt compared to Shinkai's previous films and how I couldn't predict how the plot would progress.    That being said, I would definitely say that Kimi no Na Wa is not what I consider to be Shinkai's strongest work of those that I've seen (I would probably still choose 5 Centimeters per Second for that).  I definitely liked a lot of things that this film tried to do, but at the same time did not really like the execution of many parts.  
I felt like in this movie I saw that Shinkai was trying to take steps to diversify himself as a director, and that I saw the potential, but that in other cases it just didn't quite reach its goal, and that he didn't take advantage of what made his other movies so successful.",7,MrShmucker

                The story was very well made and very straight to the point, it did a good job of making you wonder what's happening, but also it lets you know what's happening. 
The art style and animation were very smooth and fluent, I would've continued watching even if the story was boring.
Before I watched this the ending was spoiled for me and thought ""I won't be satisfied with this ending"", but I was wrong because after watching the whole thing this ending is pretty suiting/fitting.
I always procrastinated from watching this anime for 2 years and I now wish I watched this the moment it was released.

                Kimi no Na wa is beautifully animated coupled great original soundtrack to deliver a mediocre teens romance with generic unmemorable characters, story that is full of plot holes, poor re-hatched of unoriginal settings from other franchise,    that overall tried so very very hard to pull the heart string of the viewers.
In short, the BIGGEST ANIME HYPE TRAIN of 2016.
This story might had worked if there were no Internet and smartphones in Japan at the time of the story's setting. With characters having access to Internet and smartphones; the story development of Kimi no Na wa became unconvincing and down right doesn't make
                  sense. I won't go into much about it to avoid spoilers for people who have not watched it, but just keep Internet access in mind.
The story of Kimi no Na wa is basically a re-hatched of a (I hate to say it) a 2000 South Korean film ""Il Mare"". Yet, Il Mare was successful at interesting/logical story development (huge part due to shitty internet access during the year the story was set in), convincing romance, great soundtrack, great cinematography and shorter run time.
Overall, the reason that I somewhat enjoyed from Kimi no Na wa was because of its stunning animation and good soundtrack. If you take away those 2 things. It's just a poorly conceived teens romance story.
If you want a real tear-jerker of a love story anime teens romance, try Your Lie in April (Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso) and forget about Kimi no Na wa.
Animation and music will continued to improve with technological advancements, but great stories are timeless. Mark my word, Kimi no Na Wa will not age well and will never become an all time masterpiece with half-baked try-hard teen love story.

Overall: 10, it deserves nothing less
Makoto Shinkai has brought us yet another masterpiece, this one especially taking the stage and stealing 1st place on MAL, and my god does it need to be here. I don't know how many shonen series I've seen floating around the top anime that lack a real sense of emotion and deep meaning, however Kimi no Na wa not only fills those critical holes in the anime world, but is on a whole other level of entertainment. I cant even seem to find a single film that compares.
Why is it so good though?
This movie is for everyone, young or old, boy or girl, action or romance, none of this matters as this movie will appeal to every demographic with it's hyper-realistic nature and moving storyline. 
The unexpected is really what lunged this anime further up than Shinkai's other works. You thought Garden of Words was good? You believe 5 centimeters per second nailed it? They're 9's in comparison to Kimi no Na wa's story and attention to detail.
I will say it right now, this is not my all-time favorite anime, but that's only for personal reasons. I respect this movie too much to give it any less than I have, only the characters didn't suit my acquired taste, but hey that's nothing big really, they're still undoubtedly incredible and work too well with one another.
Please for the love of god, watch this anime and give it a 10. The new members of the anime community HAVE to see this anime, regardless on their interests, it's like the old classics Death Note, Steins;Gate or FullMetal - Sure not everyone will love them, but they have to try it to truly understand how beautiful anime can be.

                The hand-painted animation is stunning, from comets streaking across the night sky to an afternoon walk through fall foliage that is breathtaking.
	At 2 am, couldn’t sleep. Thought about watching some Netflix. Scrolled down my options, saw a Japanese titled movie and thought: If its bad, ill sleep sooner. 2:30am I was not laid in bed anymore, I was sitting down with a smile on my face. 3am got there and I was standing up close to the tv, full goosebumps and almost crying. 4:30am and I am writing this review. Guess no sleep.
	At the beginning of the movie you can already notice that the animation
                  is unlike any other. Its insane how much work was put in there and the visual result was nothing less then striking. When you think about the “Swapping Bodies” theme that’s been popularized recently, and reintroduced in “Kimi no na wa”, the first impression you get is that it is just silly, I mean, the concept is not bad, but it has had already been used so much, and failed so much, that there is always that little apprehension in our minds before even thinking about watching something like that. So, imagine combining the before mentioned concept with romance, it is obviously the recipe for failure, right? Wrong. This is the best movie (by far) I’ve watched ever, and now that I introduced it a little, I will try to explain why. 
	The story plays with its time line throughout the movie, which characterizes its non-linear time nature and adds more complexity to the story, and while for the most part you think you understand it completely, it only reveals itself in the final 20-30m, by the time in which if you are not already hooked, you just aren’t able to appreciate the art, relationships and development of the characters. (“The flow of time is Musubi. These are all the god's power. So, the braided cords that we make are the god's art and represent the flow of time itself. They converge and take shape. They twist, tangle, sometimes unravel, break, and then connect again. Musubi - knotting. That's time.” -quote from the movie. 
	I will abstain my self of telling the whole story or revealing any important information/spoilers, because I STRONGLY suggest to everyone, watch this movie. As much as I wanted to explain why it is such an amazing movie in details, I don’t want to ruin your experience, because even though it really connected with me in a emotional way, it may connect with you in a different way. It deserves its rating by the way. Ranked #2, receiving a 9.22/10 points, with 377.036 people voting it is obvious that every one loved this movie.

I'm not into that kinda of stuff, usually. I'm not a School-drama anime guy.
But i watched Your Name for curiosity, not expecting anything out of a movie that appeared this way in the playbill.
Damn i was wrong.
The visuals are incredible, i really enjojed the OST (specially ""Kuchikamikaze Trip"")
And the story was kinda surprising. That is actually GOOD writing and GOOD directing.
That was fun even in the first part, and after a while we got the Twist, i didn't see that coming, and i loved it.
In conclusion, we got a love story, like many. But this story does not develop like the others

                (SPOILERS)
I was starting to get tired with this movie, 1/3 of the way through although I was enjoying the characters and the settings I thought it was just another Freaky Friday movie copy, but then the twist hit me of the time difference and the disaster. I was then set on a continuous roller coaster of emotions of whether Mitsuha would survive or if either of them would even remember each other I was preparing myself for that scenario as I am a bit of a narcissist and the movie had already tricked me once. I kept thinking Mitsuha would die even after Taki's aid
                  from the future and that Taki wouldn't even remember her.
The fact that they could have forgotten each other at any moment was heartbreaking and again I was preparing myself for that scenario but I was rooting for them to live, to find each other the whole movie.
I really enjoyed the fantasy aspect of this Movie; the comet, the religion Mitsuha followed,the body swapping with the time twist and the feeling of fate/love between Mitsuha and Taki also the soundtrack was amazing.

                I created an account solely to review this amazing film. 
Directed by Makoto Shinkai, this masterpiece was both visually, and emotionally stunning from start to finish.
Story: 9
The story was about as well paced as you can get, considering the ground covered in such a short time. Occurrences which were intended to be tragic, felt tragic. Resolutions in the story felt rewarding. The plot line actually became MUCH more chaotic than would be expected from a story that would be considered cliche. This is not meant to be a knock, with the utmost respect, I felt that everything that occurred in the story was both explained,
                  and justifiable, signs that the story is almost airtight.
Art: 10
Not much to say here, every frame is immaculate. Hand drawn reflection work on every shot, I mean for god sakes I keep saying shot while reviewing an anime! That is how I felt viewing, like I was watching characters in a real environment.
Sound: 10
I appreciate the alternative rock soundtrack presented, and the piano scores are emotionally fitting to the story. I grew up in an alt rock scene, and the feeling of nostalgia regarding a story which takes place in high school-adulthood couldn't have a more fitting genre put to it, in my opinion.
Character: 10
This is where the story and directing truly shines. A two minute scene and a 30 second clip already has IMPLIED everything I need to know about one of the side characters *don't know MAL policy on spoilers or namedropping*. I feel that this is truly a sign of master directing. Not much needs to be said regarding who everyone is, almost no expository dialogue. Some say that the lack of expository dialogue is a given in a story which has to do with following a character through a journey of ""amnesia"", however I didn't feel for a moment that something was happening solely to explain why a character acts or feels the way that they do. Even complex traits regarding the little sister, who has literally no backstory talked about, can be seen, and they add to the development of the larger characters as a whole.
Enjoyment: 10
This film was enthralling. Regarding half of the anime I watch these days I often feel that I have no idea why I am even watching it. I haven't felt the urge to actually stay wide awake late at night while watching an anime for a long time. I am a pathological multi-tasker, I read, watch shows, do work, listen to music, all at once, and pretty much all the time. However, I hung on every moment of this full length production. I literally signed out of all communication the second I was interrupted once, that interruption literally pained me, I immediately knew that I was on for this ride with no distractions. 10/10 for enjoyment, easily.
Overall: 10 
On a non-emotional level, I thought that the character development was sufficient to justify any actions taken by all of the characters. Even if mild criticism would be directed toward why Mitsuha's friends participating in such a scene at the end, their frustration, and overall sentiment was clearly explained earlier in the film. 
On an emotional note, easily the best movie I've seen recently, on any medium. Directing and cinematography were breathtaking. I've never seen so much attention to detail in an anime, from start to finish. I might be totally biased, and overtaken considering I just finished this an hour ago, but this was the kind of movie that I want to just walk up to someone, and say ""Just watch this movie, from start to finish, trust me"".

                Overall the anime is good but not as good as you would expect from the hype it got. The anime seemed to lag behind in the story department. The story starts good but starts to weaken dramatically towards the end to the point of not making any sense.
I have watched about 100 anime now and a lot of them are much better than this show. Seeing it at the top of rankings just makes me cringe. Seems everyone just likes to jump on the hype train even when rating shows.

I believe that this movie should have a sequel, but shouldn't have a sequel since it basically had a perfect ending for Mitsuha and Taki. Most fans just want a sequel just to see them together and have a future. This may be true, but the ending was so perfect in my opinion that it doesn't really need a sequel since it probably would take a lot of time and would probably ruin the story. Thanks for reading!

Story:2/10
It's based off of a cliché trope known more commonly as ""freaky Friday"" in the online world where basically two (or more) people switch others place.
The ""plot twists"" in this movie are just so random, like what was the point of the whole earthquake arc? Basically the
                  second half just doesn't make sense at ALL, it's just fillers to make it a sob story and convinces you into thinking that it's an amazing movie which it ISNT.
The first half was pretty decent, they introduced the characters and their point of view in the situation although it was pretty boring because some of the fillers where the protagonist has meaningless conversations with her friends which contribute nothing to the story. Although the second half is very very poorly written.
The point of the second half? ""True love will find itself no matter where you go"", nice message, but, again, where does this add to? The romance? Yes. The plot? No. 
The plot was that two people switched minds and you're supposed to turn that into a ""romance"" and no, this is not how you turn it into a romance. You can't just add unrealistic scenarios and somehow make the two characters find each other when they are in different TIMES. This is just for the romance aspect and doesn't contribute to the plot progression at all, although we did get  character development. 
The ending? It was really disappointing, I was expecting so much more but I'm not gonna spoil it.
Characters: 3/10
Mitsuha is a cliché, she's made to just fit the ideal waifu type but she has no personality whatsoever, she's naive, stupid and whatever adjective fits her personality.
The other guy (forgot his name) has no personality, it's like looking at human being who is hollow with nothing inside.
The characters were extremely boring to watch and felt so empty to me. 
I wouldn't have minded a few more characters who could've contributed to plot progression of this story more, focusing on only 2 characters who are really boring is just not cool.
 I get that this is supposed to focus on the two protagonists but if you want to make an entertaining movie then add personality to the characters, well written and thought out plot twists and not random ones which just fit the convenience of the romance and drama aspect of the show. Its a really cliché romance, that's all.
Sound: 8/10
One of the best soundtracks ever, even though I hated the movie and characters, the soundtrack itself gives me nostalgia when I hear it.
Art: 10/10 Excellent, brilliant, show-stopping, incredible, amazing. The art was so beautiful and it's like eye candy, the backgrounds and overall aesthetic is just so pleasing to the eye.

Art 10/10: Absolutely amazing animation, natural and charming movements. An utter delight and feast for the eyes. 
Story: 3/10 
Extremely nonsensical. [potential spoilers] Even if I were to suspend my disbelief and say that they knew that it was a dream, how did they not notice when they wrote down in their respective diary the respective time gaps? It is literally three years apart.[potential spoilers] Also, it is literally impossible for their friends to not notice how they radically different they are from who they were. It really pulls me out of the film when the body
                  swapping happens and no one thinks ""Wow, this guy/girl literally forgot EVERYTHING about where he/she is, who I am, and who he/she is. Huh, maybe's something's wrong here. Methinks we should bring him/her to a psychologist for his/her severe amnesia."" Because that was literally what happened yet this reaction never happened. 
Characters 5/10: It wasn't about the depth or chemistry of the romance. I didn't find the two characters particularly interesting. Their interactions are conveyed mostly through texts messages for half of the film, so I didn't find it endearing when they finally met up and somehow fell in love. The length they will go to meet each other again over being body-swapped was extremely off-putting; reason being they never had a proper conversation, just romantically gaze off vague concepts of each other based off superficial fragments of what others know of them and little of what they were willing to reveal. But nevertheless, it was so well-animated and put together I was actually willing to forgive the underdevelopment of what should have been a couple of huge plot points. The way they convey the emotions they were experiencing over their desperation, the love that they had (not sure why) actually filled those holes because it felt so believable. Unfortunately, it was still terrible every time I remember they are doing this because they body-swapped. 
Enjoyment/Final Score 6/10: 
I can see what all the hype is about, it was a meticulously put-together film, the imagery exceeds expectations although I didn't quite like the montage bits. It is beyond amazing to see how a poor and confusing concept can be so well-executed. I might have enjoyed it more if it wasn't so universally acclaimed but I am not sure, the story is really beyond awful. The characters mediocre. I guess it's really what you are looking for in a film because the animations, the atmosphere, really makes you forget all of its flaws almost instantly.",6,Trolls_Bane

                I bet you are one of those people saw the 9.40 rating (currently) and came scrolling through reviews for reassurance before actually watching it. Listen to me. Kimi no Na wa is a masterpiece; go watch it right now, if you haven't already. Since I hate spoilers, this review will contain NO SPOILERS so you can rest assure, and just jump right in!
Story: 10/10. As you might have already seen in the synopsis and the trailer, it's about a boy and a girl, switching places. Yeah, I know, it's a pretty simple plot that yields only some decent interest if you ask me. I had
                  my doubts, so I decided to watch it. I was blown away. The plot itself is pretty plain, but the amazing thing about Kimi no Na wa was its brilliant plot execution. From the start to finish, the protagonists experience an endless series of conflicts that drags our heart along and play with it. Shinkai Makoto, the director, script writer, and original creator is truly a genius. 
Art: 10/10. What do you expect? It's CoMix Wave Films! The artwork is a feast to the eyes. It was able to express all the feelings of the hardworking animators to us all. Scenes directions were especially captivating and camera angles were exceptionally well done.
Sound: 10/10. I was drawn to the Kimi no Na wa since I heard its music in the first trailer, months before it aired. Beautiful music flows through the whole duration of the movie, which brings the watching experience up to a whole new level. The synchronization between the art and sound made it very pleasing to watch.
Character: 10/10. One of Kimi no Na wa's strongest point is character development. In the beginning, we were introduced to two characters, Mitsuha, a girl who lives in a little town in the middle of nowhere and Taki, a boy living in the heart of Tokyo. The story started out by showing their daily everyday life, which allow us to get a closer look onto the characters. Then after that, it shows how both of them switch roles, and how they react differently outside their comfort-zone, allowing us to create a bond with both of them. And as the story progress, the bonds between you and them would just grow bigger and bigger until you were hugging the screen before you know it.
Enjoyment: 10/10. The first 30 minutes was plain and slow-pacing, which may be boring for some of you. Few comedic reliefs will pop up once in a while when you least expect it, which really enhance its effect.  I was kind of bored at first too, but when the main story suddenly kicks in out of nowhere, my mouth was left hanging for the rest of the movie. (That was not even an overstatement; really :D) And as it turn out, those boring parts actually connects with everything else at the end, which make you understand the message of the story completely. Mark my words, focus on every parts of this masterpiece whether it's boring or not; you won't regret it.
Overall: 10/10. Saying that Kimi no Na wa is amazing is quite of an understatement.  I haven't watch such a beautiful and meaningful movie in a big while. I felt so fulfilled and satisfied when I finished it that I was smiling and clapping like an idiot for a while. Kimi no Na wa is definitely one of my favorite anime/movie of all time. I guarantee that you won't find such a flawless movie easily.  If you are planning to watch it, please savor the experience slowly and thoroughly like you are tasting something expensive and delicious because the flavor won't linger forever. But in all seriousness, Kimi no Na wa was such an adventure of emotion that made me cried so hard; twice. Kimi no Na wa truly deserves a 10/10; not just from me, but from everyone of you who've witness this wonderful piece of art and acknowledge how remarkable Kimi no Na wa is.",10,danat17

But hoo boy I wasn't expecting that I would be truly taken into his wild ride. I ended up really cheering for the protagonists, hoping that everything would end up all right. Especially knowing that Shinkai loved his bittersweet/sad endings.
And thank God it did, or else I would have to lower my score just for out of the sheer rage
                  I would feel.
Bravo. Never before I cared this much about a romance story.",10,Ugoki

                Yet another masterpiece set by Makoto Shinkai to upgrade and ameliorate anime industry that's filled with ""moe"" garbage, that I obviously dislike. 
And it is evident just how much this movie can manipulate with viewers emotions, which is indeed more than needed from any form of art.
What drives this movie towards imperfection is the lack of depth in characters and story.
For an example it is told once that our protagonist, Tachibana Taki is fond of architecture.
He is also short tempered, that has been told... Once. 
I have seen few of character personal traits in action. 
But regardless of losing little details, the characters are finely
                  executed and give a vibe of real and existing people which makes you dive into the movie.
As for the story, original, simple and beautiful as expected... Dreams connecting our protagonists together, truly shows originality and signature distance between people. 
I like reference to dreams and how we forget them when we wake up, some really deep shit. Just another example of originality this show holds.
Arguably it could use bit more in depth and details to be presented, for instance we are only told that this phenomenon happened to Miyamizu family not the reason why this happens or how...
I am avoiding details, for the review is whether to watch it or not, which is why spoilers are out of question.. 
Art and animation feels real and smooth which is big plus.
*Overall - This movie feels like it needs more time, the story feels bit rushed  and characters feel like outlines of what needs to be finished. 
The art is wonderful and beautiful, and pure eye candy.
 At some point of the show, the art feels like an intruder and out of place. I enjoyed this show very much and as I said it feels like it needs an hour more of screen time at least.

                Undeniably one of the greatest anime films I have seen. And certainly up there when it comes to films in general. 
The extremely rich and developed artwork was visually stimulating and engaging. Intoxicating the viewer immediately at the incredible detail and colors emanated throughout the film. 
The plot was very touching and quite emotional to see play out. The way this film presents the story and incorporates themes of love, time, and wonder was phenomenal. The way everything weaved together was interesting to watch from beginning to end, and ultimately served for a greatly enjoyable and at times very emotional experience. 
There were humorous moments,
                  there were sad moments, and other moments of adrenaline and suspense. The main characters themselves were interesting and instantly relatable for me, causing me to identify with and care about them as the story progressed. The way that their relationship with one another develops and the journey they embark as everything unfolds is well-done and quite memorable. 
There are a few twists and turns, and even though many people would have an idea of how things would play out the film nonetheless does a masterful job of gripping the viewer and making them enjoy every second of it. The twists that occurred were thought-provoking, as was the entire concept and what the film was trying to say in general.

                alright dont judge my review its pretty late for anyone watching this movie, plus I went with the expectation that's its going to be a lovey-dovey romance film but boy I was wrong.
This is a must watch film for anyone starting out on anime, it will give you an entirely different perspective on anime.
I will try to keep my review short and simple, to the point.
First Story,the plot was suited for a film and I really enjoyed the suspense they kept till the end. There were major twists halfway. If you are a pure shounen fan u might not like it for your taste, but
                  the beautiful animation will make up for it.
And there's a bit of scifi here like parallel universes so it might be hard to figure it out but u will get it.
 Art here is the key selling point, now I haven't watched other movies like this but at the start I was amazed by its crystal clear art, with detail in every aspect displayed beautifully. Say it cutting tomatoes or shooting comets every thing  is done the right way and id rewatch this film just for the animation. Well done in that aspect.
Coming to sound, now I am no audiophile, but sound is just as well done as animation. If u wear headphones or use surround sound, you can really feel the immersive feel of being with the characters and watching their point of view. of course this is made to stream on theatres so u can understand. Soundtrack was great, its soothing ending song gave it a perfect satisfying knack to it, and I am glad I didn't skip the PC scenes(post cred.)
Character-wise except MC and heroine, the supporting characters didn't play much role in the plot, they were there just for plot sake. Didnt really make an impact. Since the movie is focused only on those two , can't really complain. Also the VA is done well, I appreciate their efforts.
Overall I enjoyed the movie and I would rewatch it just for animation. And I really liked how the plot narrates from characters point of view and both the animation and sound made it feel like I was right in the middle of the story, that's how impressed I was with the film, and btw I was never a fan of romance tag, so don't watch it with such prejudice, and trust me after watching this film, you will feel satisfied.",10,Devilhand2304

                What. A. Masterpiece.
My mind was blown away by this amazing piece of art produced by Makoto Shinkai. A movie that should be on your watchlist regardless of whether you watch anime or not.
The plot is original, the characters are interesting and relatable, the visuals stunning, and the music from RADWIMPS is a cut above the rest. Your Name is one of those films that leaves a lasting impact on the viewer. I was left feeling empty as it ended, as I remembered that I had to come back to reality. Not many movies have made me feel this way. Definitely a must-watch.

10/10, moving on. -------------------
As you can see, I gave Kimi no Na Wa the rating of 4/10. Keep calm and learn why:
Mainly because I have once again failed to integrate in my mind the appeal of what I heard was called ""subtlety"" in japanese storytelling. The elements of the story were not only predictable but they were also presented in such a way that they are just *almost* half-assed, meaning that the various intentions of the storytelling were willfully inhibited just a little bit, just enough to make this movie, by the end of it, feel like an itch you'll never be able to scratch and because of that you'll want to hurry to forget you've ever watched it. 
I mean, it was trying not to be indulgent, but it was already stupid and melodramatic, so the only way it could have redeemed itself was by having the two protagonists (if I can call the girl a protagonist--the guy had a stronger personality than her, was more assertive in the story, which in turn made him seem like the ""real hero"" of the movie at some point, and that is alright since the whole movie is cliché and dumb, except it seemed to have a different intention in mind with the premise, but OH WELL IT TURNED OUT LIKE THIS ANYWAY) the only way it could have redeemed itself was by having the two idiots literally fucking tear at each other the second they met, because that at least is satisfying to watch even if it's dumb, more satisfying to watch than the two idiots being undecisive until the last permissible moment of the movie holy fuck literally.
I hate this about Japanese stuff.
A certain anime I've watched before Na Wa. that I won't spoil here was completely degenerate, it didn't try to be anything better, so much so that it was sort of refreshing. It was an idle, relaxing watch for me, and memorably, it did something in one episode close to the end, something in which the protagonist's ""side girl"" who obviously likes the protagonist and contrary to the ""main girl"", knows exactly what she wants, actually lays one on him.  She says things to him that kick the story miles forward (in relation to its snail pace) and affects change in him. She actually pushes him on top of her bed and he doesn't freak out or indulge or—He has a very human reaction to the whole deal. The scene had a point and it reached it. No playing around. The scene was not vulgar, indulgent, melodramatic or unsubtle. It seemed pretty natural. I wish there could be more of this style of storytelling in anime and manga.
'Course, the example I used here involves romance, but I meant what I said in a broader sense, just those examples are the most straightforward or simple examples that came to mind.
Not to mention, shrewd civilain Versus clueless countryperson: Offensive trope is offensive. 
Not to mention, plot-holes of glory. I'm sure there are articles online that are dedicated to pointing out these funny little things, articles that aren't busy sucking Na Wa's multitude of dicks. 
Visuals:
10/10, moving on—wait, there was a a handful of ""timelapse"" sequences that egregiously flaunt brand marks at you and serve no deep purpose other than striking awe into the audience. And financing the movie production. 
Sound:
They did the cheesy insert song thing 3 times. I'd only be able to tell the 3 individual songs apart after a dozen listens. Rad Wimps are rad though, check em out.

Wow, what a movie. I was truly engaged the whole time, and personally, that's a big thing. I went into this move with 0 knowledge on who made it, the plot, the characters or even have seeing pictures or footage from it. The only thing I knew previously about this movie, was that it was pretty highly regarded by the anime community, and in Japan in general. Look, I'm not the most eloquent and proficient reviewer (not even a reviewer at all) but I'm going to jot down some reasons why I enjoyed this movie so much. 
From the beginning, I had a pretty
                  clear idea what the main plot point of this movie was going to be, though this was presented though subtle character movements and cleverly placed character shots that would switch back and forward from the two main characters. The story progressed nicely and shared nice insights into both characters lives and how their interactions affected one another, which at times were delivered with a genuinely funny and realistic sense of humour. The dedicated segments to both of the main characters barely lagged or felt like they went on for too long, which kept my interest focused. 
Another admirable thing about this movie, was the way that it invoked emotions from the watchers, specifically how it showed some pretty devastating emotional situations the characters went through, but avoided cheesy anime tropes to portray them. In a way, the emotional aspects of this movie were reminiscent of live action romantic drama films.
Can we talk about the beautiful artwork in this film? Specifically, the background art. It was clear a lot of detail went into the artwork and at time it left me speechless. At times though, however, the characters somewhat resembled characters from Studio Ghibli movies, which isn't really a complaint, and more of an observation. 
The ending section of this movie was fantastic, particularly how it gave the characters a purpose to reverse what had previously happened to them (you know what I mean), which created a sense of tension that wasn't too overdone.

[Review contains some Spoilers]
Story/Characters: 3/10
The story revolves around two adolescents who mysteriously switch bodies for sporadic periods of time across the span of an unknown amount of time. They end up building a relationship with each other in the process of this mess and eventually develop a desire to meet up. However, that goal becomes hard to reach as even more bizarre things occur, seeking to prevent them from that goal.
The story is poor, it’s so superficial, backwards and shrouded in vagueness that it makes my head spin. The more I think about it the lower I want to rate it. I
                  was originally going to give it a 5/10 because, at the time, I didn’t give notice to just how bad the narrative was. And it’s not just the narrative; the characters are severely undeveloped blank slates that have no reason for anything they do because none is given to us. Instead, a pathetic attempt at ""showing not telling"" is made, pathetic in that what it shows us is irrelevant to the plot.
So the story is really poor because it doesn’t have a solid foundation from which to build off of and that becomes more evident the more you try to follow the logic/flow of the story. A good story requires a solid, believable foundation and this lacks that. The mystery of the body-switching, which allows for the subsequent budding relationship/romance sub-plot to emerge (which a good portion of the movie focuses on), isn’t given any depth at all and there’s no reasoning given as to why such a key theme is glossed over. 
Imagine finding out that you’ve been switching bodies with someone you don’t know. What do you do? Don’t you try to find a fix for it or at the very least understand what’s going on? Isn’t it an inconvenience to your life, goals, dreams etc.? A lot of intrigue like this isn’t even explored, and the little of it that is is glossed over by vagueness and a fast pacing. For example, one of the characters (Mitsuha) actually wished to be a handsome boy living in Tokyo. Why did the writer even bring up that point? Was it supposed to off-set the shock of becoming such a boy moments later? I don’t think so because there’s no serious backing behind her wish. It’s just one of those moments where you just say the first thing that comes to mind without much thought. No point in giving much thought into it anyway as she is an undeveloped character that doesn't care about anything other than what the writer demands of her. So yeah, it might be fun for Mitsuha to be a guy for a while….but to be a guy for an unknown amount of time (could be forever for all she knows, after all, she doesn’t understand much of how it’s possible or why it’s even happening to begin with) and on top of that to have a guy you don’t know living in your shoes while you’re taking his place. Who would want that? As for why that specific guy (Taki) is picked, well, we’ll never know. 
When the switching first starts, the shock of such an event is played off as a dream, which leads to some humorous occurrences. It isn’t until a day later that it’s realized that it isn’t a dream, as they switch back to their respective bodies afterwards and find that they did things the previous day that they don’t remember doing. After that, the shock sets in and failed attempts at rationalizing and dealing with the situation are made. I say failed attempts because rather than working together to try and understand what’s going on and maybe fix things in the process, they focus on understanding and respecting each other’s personal space whilst they’re bodies are switched.  I would’ve been fine with that had it not been for the fact that it isn’t until several weeks pass (? Unsure on the timeline as the story is vague on those details… though weeks are mentioned at one point) that the idea comes to actually get into contact with each other, as up until that point they had just been communicating through each other’s diaries. So yeah, potential weeks of awkward body-switching go by and THEN they decide “Oh, it might be a good idea to get into closer contact with each other and work things out” Sike! What really happens is that they want to get into contact because all of a sudden they have feelings for each other, for no reason. Yep, totally believable.
If you thought the madness ended there, you couldn’t be more wrong! Even more madness ensues as a random time-warp and subsequent amnesia sub-plot is introduced to spice up the romance sub-plot and give it the tragic edge that is a staple of the genre. Yes, it turns out that they don’t get to meet up right away because all of a sudden one of them doesn’t exist because they died several years ago…and all of a sudden the other character doesn’t remember them and only has a faint feeling and a mental scene to go off of. Don’t worry though, because LOVE CONQUERS ALL and defies reason in the process! Stuff happens, happy ending, all of it is contrived, meaningless and an utter childish fantasy that doesn’t teach anyone anything.

                The first time I watched Kimi no Na wa I immediately purchased the film on Blu-ray but the more I rewatch the film the more the entertainment value drops for me. I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad film but throughout my reruns I could see more and more of its flaws. 
Without the surprise of the twist it just seems like they shoehorned this apocolyptic plot line to add more drama to the film. I admit it worked on me the first time but now it just seems kinda dumb and lazy. It was somewhat decent with the whole switching bodies thing. I would've
                  been fine if it was just a simple romantic slice of life comedy. But adding the whole cataclysmic event sort of cheapens the film. 
And I can't really see that much chemistry between the two leading roles. Sure, they might know each others' individual lives but that doesn't necessarily mean they know how the other person themselves is actually like. They just send messages to each other from time to time and that's it. You never really see them talk or spend time together to get to know each others' personality. In fact the only times you see them together is at the climax of the film and at the very end of it which are both only a few minutes long. And yes, I know it's because of the twist in the middle of the film but that's another reason why I don't like it. You don't even have that much time to see the characters live out the other person's life because it's skimmed through to make room for this subplot. 
Now with all that being said I don't think the film is awful. I would be lying to you if I said I didn't think that the animation in this film is gorgeous, especially in the intro, and I really enjoyed the Japanese rock songs placed throughout it. And again I wouldn't necessarily call this a bad film. I've even rewatched it here and there to see if my opinion on it has changed over time. The message that one day we'll find the missing piece in our lives and that everything will be okay is an uplifting one. But the way that they present the message could've been done better with a more grounded plot and more solid character chemistry and development. I'm sorry but I really don't see the hype to this film. I just found it perfectly tolerable.",6,junx2

                Includes minor spoilers.
The moniker “the next Miyazaki” is a title often bestowed upon Makoto Shinkai for his ability to direct aesthetically pleasing films that shy away from the slew of negative clichés of anime, catering well to the general Western audience. Upon closer inspection, it would appear that the parallels between the two directors are often merely superficial, as the themes they explore and the style with which they do so are incredibly different and nuanced in their own ways. For Shinkai, it is no exaggeration to say that almost, if not all his films to date have dealt with themes of teenage romance, distance
                  (both spatial and temporal), and loss. However good his oeuvre may be, one cannot help but wonder how more many times Shinkai could redress the same story before he moved on. Doubts were quickly assuaged, however, as it became abundantly clear to me only partway through Your Name that he was only just getting started. Fact of the matter is: execution is everything, and Shinkai executed his latest film to near perfection.
At its very core, Your Name is a colorful body-swapping tale a la Freaky Friday. There is Mitsuha, a 17 year-old girl living in the placid countryside town of Itomori, who yearns for life in the big city while she begrudgingly attends to her shrine maiden duties; and Taki, a boy of similar age residing in Tokyo who is also a part-time waiter and aspiring architect. They, like the viewer, are slowly clued into the fact that they are switching bodies in their dreams with ensuing hilarity. As Mitsuha and Taki learn more about each other’s diametrically opposed lifestyles, they reflect on their own lives and begin to appreciate what the other has to bring into it. If this sounds like a promising setup for a romance, you would be pleasantly surprised at just how much more there is. It is absolutely perplexing how Shinkai weaves together so many elements of fantasy, science fiction, and even disaster films, yet still managed to wrap everything up neatly in a beautiful ribbon.
In terms of writing and directing, it would be a gross understatement to say that Your Name has eclipsed Shinkai’s previous works. The melodrama and heavy-handed writing has been dialed down from the likes of Garden of Words, replaced by a focused progression of the narrative and a hitherto unseen touch of humour from Shinkai as well. A wonderful sense of continuity is prevalent throughout the film as it thematically plays on opposites, with the ever-present juxtaposition of dreams and reality, femininity and masculinity, traditions and modernisms, fate and free will…the list goes on. This is of course underscored by the characteristic Shinkai themes of the pursuit of a distant romance and loss, engendering a painful sense of unfulfillable longing that pervades a majority of the almost-two-hour movie. Despite the long runtime (shared by one of Shinkai’s worst-paced films in Children Who Chase Lost Voices), the pacing of Your Name was near impeccable. The film starts slowly with disparate scenes that ostensibly make no sense, owing to the use of clever cuts and well-disguised transitions (which happen all throughout the film). As the plot unravels, the pace picks up at a staggering rate, and never once does it let up. From the light-hearted introductory act that will have you in stitches to the tear-inducing finale, Your Name will is an edge-of-your-seat rollercoaster that will run the entire emotional gamut, violently plucking your heartstrings and leaving you emotionally drained. I can only imagine how great it was for first-time viewers that went in with no prior knowledge.
Over the years, Shinkai’s name has become synonymous with gorgeous visuals. Your Name is no exception, offering frame after frame of artistic goodness and some of the most beautifully animated renditions of Tokyo and rural Japan ever (okay, Garden of Words probably still takes the cake for the former). Seriously, those time-lapse shots in the Zen Zen Zense montage? Perfect. Photorealism is the name of the game, as landscapes, buildings, and objects are all drawn with excruciating mind to detail, and these are portrayed with equally impressive sweeping shots as well. The colours are vivid and lines are soft and clean. To top it off, unlike the folks at Studio Ghibli, Shinkai is not averse to liberally using digital lighting effects to enhance the artwork. Frequently incorporated are lens flares, light rays, shadow lines and particle effects that add just a touch more magic and sparkle to the shots without being distracting. The end result is an emotionally captivating visual presentation, one that can be hyper-photorealistic at times, yet is also often tinged with a soft and dreamy haze that subtly contributes to a mounting sense of melancholy. Character design, courtesy of Masayoshi Tanaka (AnoHana, Toradora, Anthem of the Heart etc.) is simple and charming. The one downside was the animation of character movement, which had some moments of inconsistency or awkwardness towards the end of the film, but overall, the visuals are some of the best in the medium.
RADWIMPS does a tremendous job on the music, composing a cracking and eclectic soundtrack that combines a handful of pop-rock tunes with a collection of contemporary classical pieces scored for piano, a small string orchestra, and a few woodwinds. While not quite on the level of the best Joe Hisaishi scores from a purely musical standpoint, the more strikingly contemporary and poppy sound created by RADWIMPS lends itself well to the teen aspect of the film, likely more so than Hisaishi’s more classically-entrenched style. The insert songs are well-placed and downright catchy, the type that is likely to be looped for days on end. Despite being understated and often taking a backseat to the film itself, the orchestral score is poignant and makes use of a few recurring themes and motives to augment the feeling of nostalgia. Mone Kamishiraishi and Ryunosuke Kamiki nail their performances as Mitsuha and Taki, respectively (or vice-versa), with their organic and effortless delivery, and, critically, their inflections in their body-swapped scenes that are just nuanced enough without seeming overwrought. In a word, believable. The sound design was excellent as well, leveraging well-recorded and realistic-sounding samples against moments of palpable silence for an incredibly immersive, and, dare I say, impactful experience.
Nevertheless, the film is far from flawless, as character development was often forgone in favour of plot progression, and some of the animation and production values seemed to take a hit towards the end. Despite all that, Your Name is, without a doubt, one of the most gripping and exhilarating anime films I have ever seen, having absolutely lived up to its hype, however immense. Lovely film, would absolutely watch in theatres again.

                This is something I'm making after seeing other reviews essentially just slandering this movie. This could also essentially be a rant. I just finished this show tonight, having high expectations. With that being said, each and every single one of them was met. The ONLY problem that I had with the show was that I was confused about a LOT of things involving Japanese culture (Red Ribbon of Fate, etc) and the different religions being portrayed. On top of this, the scene at the mountain and Mitsuha disappearing all had its own actual reason and impact.
First off, the story. The story was amazing to me.
                  All of the subtle hints that were laid out here and there, as well as the whole story just coming together. Taking a deeper dive into this anime to find all of its niches really gives you a sense of appreciation for how much thought was put into this anime.
I don't believe I even have to really say anything here. Even the people giving this show a 2/10 acknowledged the animation was good.
The sound design didn't stick out to me as much during the actual show like the show Horimiya for example, but upon re-watching the show, I realized just how much of a difference it makes.
Characters themselves weren't anything to behold to be completely honest. It is all a personal thing to me. I got way too attached to these characters and actually enjoyed them a lot, but I can understand other people's reasons for not liking them as much as me.
Enjoyment is easily a 12/10. After watching the show I couldn't help but just sit there in awe as the credits rolled. Absolute masterpiece.
Overall, I literally only made this because I'm seeing WAY too much Your Name slander. I can understand not giving it a 9 or 10 out of 10 but a damn 2 overall? You're tripping.",10,Noxaaa

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!
Oh, wow. Look at that. Another 10/10 review for Your Name. How original.
I know that I'm far from the first to give this movie the rating it deserves, and I highly doubt many will actually bother to stop and read through the entire review as nearly everything I'm about to say has already been said by thousands of other people a thousand times over, but I wanted to put it out there because A) I love the movie, and B) there is one negative aspect of this movie that I don't think a lot of people actually mentioned before that I think
                  deserves attention.
So, to the three of you that still haven't seen this movie and/or don't know what it's about (and don't mind spoilers), here's a brief synopsis of the movie's overall plot. Your Name is a supernatural romance film that takes place in the modern year (2016 at the time) and it stars two Japanese high school students: a boy named Taki who lives in midtown Tokyo somewhere within/close to the Shibuya ward and a girl called Mitsuha who lives somewhere north of Tokyo out in the boonies in a fictional lake town called Itomori. Taki is just an average high school kid, but Mitsuha is a descendant of a Shinto priesthood passed down by generations and she is in training to become the next priestess. Assumably, every priestess in Mitsuha's bloodline forms a mystical bond with a random boy somewhere in Japan. In this case, Mitsuha forms the bond with Taki. The bond links their lives together and causes them to dream. Within the dream, they both wake up inside each others bodies and are forced to live out each others lives until the next day. At first, they both think the dreams are just that: dreams, but hey, what do you know, the dream is happening in real time! Over the course of the movie, as they quite literally continue to walk in each other's shoes, they begin to fall in love with each other by living out each others lives. Eventually, the love becomes so strong they want to see each other, but by the time they make that decision, the dreams stop and they have no way of contacting each other. This, all while they slowly start to lose their memories of the other person and the other world in which they dreamt about.
After the dreams stop, Taki makes it his mission to find out where Mitsuha is so he can meet her in person. With the unexpected help of his friends, he manages to find the clues and piece them together and, to his shock and horror, discovers she had been killed years ago, along with her entire lake town, by a meteorite that struck the land and wiped them out. Despite having a crisis of confidence, Taki is unwilling to give up. He seeks to uncover the mystery surrounding the dreams and the meteor, believing there exists some unknown connection between the two that might give him a chance to wind back the clock and stop the tragic event before it occurs.
Will he succeed in his quest or will the girl he fell in love with, the people he met, and the town that had become his obsession forever be lost behind that unfortunate disaster?
And that's where I'll leave that. So, I know body swapping isn't particularly original and most of the stories surrounding the concept (fanfiction mostly) end up being washed-up garbage and/or wish fulfillment of some sort or another, but this is the first and only story I've come across that actually ended up producing a solid story from the concept. In fact, it's so good, it ended up being the highest grossing anime film at the time and, objectively, one of the best anime films out there.
Let me officially begin this review by explaining why that is...
THE GOOD:
Despite being a body-swap love story, Your Name isn't wish fulfillment of any kind and the quality of storytelling is far beyond that of fanfiction I've ever read, thank Christ! After hearing only great things about this movie, I expected to be disappointed. In fact, the body-swapping was the very aspect I expected to not only exist, but drag the story down immensely! Thankfully, it not only doesn't drag it down, but it's used as a tool to tell it's story and develop the romance.
The story is easily the best part of this movie! While it isn't wholly original, it's one of the best romance anime films/shows I've ever seen in the genre thus far (one of the few that isn't either bad or mediocre). Being a romance, the two protagonists obviously fall in love, but the way in which they fall in love is very unique. Unlike most romance stories where the two meet somewhere at the start, Taki and Mitsuha never actually meet one another until the final third of the movie and before that happens, they've already fallen for each other. How is that possible? Well, they slowly fell in love while inhabiting each other's lives, spending time with their friends and loved ones, and getting to know the other person through their own eyes. The two learn all there is to know about each other simply from being them. In fact, Taki and Mitsuha only ever meet 3 times throughout the entire movie and each moment is very short and used sparingly. They spent less than 5 minutes together on screen!
This is excellent because when the protagonists do finally meet one another at any of these moments, it's a momentous occasion! I was on the edge of my seat each time waiting and listening to every word and watching every detail just waiting to find out what happens next. I don't think I ever blinked the first time I watched the iconic magic hour scene. This scene is one of the best moments in any anime and possibly one of the greatest romantic moments of any romance story.
Each moment within the movie can be heartbreaking or heartwarming, but they are always hopeful. You feel the emotion weight of every scene, you feel these character's desperation to find one another after they realize they may never get the chance, and you feel the love and sheer joy that washes over them when they finally find each other and see each other face to face after the disappointment of realizing they live in different worlds at different periods of time, or that the other just doesn't remember who the other is. Every breath they take, every slip, every touch is meaningful and very few stories develop the emotional weight necessary to create it.
In other words, Your Name is essentially a star-crossed love story that slowly boils towards these two characters who should be fundamentally unable to be together, finding each other despite the odds by figuring out how to overcome the obstacle in the way, and forging a path ahead that eventually leads them back to each other. It's a message of love, of hope, and of joy. It's about the idea that anything is possible.
I've read reviews of this movie on this site, even from people who's opinions I greatly appreciate, who've said the characters in Your Name aren't all that great and I couldn't disagree more. While there are definitely developmental flaws (I will explain later), the main characters are some of the best I've seen in high school romance story. Admittedly, it's a low bar, but the bar has been raised tremendously. Each character is different. They have their quirks, their motivations, and their lives, and their stories are not told, but shown through the eyes of the other protagonist while they inhabit their bodies. Neither Taki nor Mitsuha are particularly special. They aren't the strongest, the smartest, the most good-looking, or the best at particularly anything in their class as far as we know. They're just average teens with above average looks with their own dreams and struggles who are seeking to escape their mundane lives.
The side characters all have a purpose for being in this show and, like the main characters, they have their own quirks and personalities. They may not be in the movie as much as some might have wanted them to be nor are they as well developed or as spectacular as you'd expect for a movie of this caliber, but the story is easily strong enough to make up for it, and the characters themselves are used only when it makes sense for the story. There isn't any wasted space or a subplot that deviates from the main story. After all, this is about Taki and Mitsuha and the bizarre situation in which they found themselves in.
The way in which each character behaves makes sense. I haven't found a moment where I was taken aback by something a character does and wondered why the fuck did you do that? The characters are consistent pretty much all throughout the movie. If a character does something dumb, it's because they are dumb. If a character acts afraid, it's because they have reason to be afraid (even if I myself wouldn't be). If a character acts emotionally, it's because they have reason to be emotional.
One of the best side characters is Mitsuha's father (Toshiki) whom, after losing his wife, spirals into a depression that ends with him abandoning his family and the family business for politics. One of the most chilling moments in the movie occurs while Taki inhabits Mitsuha's body one last time and, while attempting to save everyone from the meteor, pleads with her father to evacuate the town. The father, understandably, thinks his daughter has gone absolutely insane and suggests she see a therapist. Taki, in Mitsuha's body, frustrated by her father's inability to listen to anything he has to say, grips the man's tie and forces him out of his seat.
Toshiki, having realized that this reaction could not have been his daughter's, has a revelation. His tone changes. His eyes soften and grew wide as he slowly remembers the miracle that is in front of his eyes. He stares into the eyes of his daughter - no - the eyes of someone else. He is speechless, but finds a way to speak. Even still, there is only one question he can ask, ""wait a second. Who are you?"" Just writing that out gives me goosebumps. Even to this day, that one scene hasn't lost its potency and it's unfortunate the film didn't delve into that moment any further. It's truly one of the most underrated scenes in the movie and probably all of anime!
Unlike most anime, these characters don't suddenly break character and turn into someone else just because the plot says so. When the characters are established, they are set until they develop and they don't change suddenly for the sake of a dumb gag joke or in order to push the story. The character's react to the story and the situation depending on who they were to begin with.
Each character may be different, but what unites them all is that nobody gives up. It doesn't matter if a situation seems hopeless, it doesn't matter if nobody believes them or listens to them, and it doesn't matter if everything that is stacked against them suggests either death or eternal separation from one another. They find a way. That's what made this movie so special!
The art is amazing as expected for a Shinkai movie and though it doesn't quite reach the level of Makoto Shinkai's other work, Garden of Words, in that department, they are within the same league. While characters are all well realized, the backgrounds are jaw-dropping. I actually live in Hiroo, Shibuya-ku so I've visited a couple of the places depicted in the movie and the attention to detail is unbelievable! They're almost identical to their real life counter part.
The sound is really good overall. The soundtrack is the best part, especially the orchestral/piano pieces. The music captures the emotional tone of each scene wonderfully and elevates it nicely. Radwimps are good musicians no doubt and while the pop music isn't particular great in and of itself, the rest of the sound design is top notch from the solid voice acting to the fantastic ambience and sound effects. It's really well done, though probably the weakest aspect of the show's positive elements.
THE BAD:
Keep in mind, there is no perfect movie. Even masterpieces are flawed, and this movie has its share of issues.
The story, while excellent, is incomplete. I didn't notice it when I first watched the movie. Hell, I didn't notice it the second or third time either, but after watching this film several times over, what I noticed is that whether it was due to budgetary issues or time constraints, much of the movie's original story was cut from the final product.
The biggest example involves Tokishi and Taki's interaction. After Mitsuha returns to her body for the last time, when she runs back to her father, Toshiki still believes it's Taki, reacts aggressively and says, ""don't tell me you're back."" That suggests that, after the revelation he had regarding Taki, the conversation still didn't end well. We knew that, but it doesn't make sense why. Why wouldn't he evacuate the town after witnessing this miracle? I'm sure there may have been a reason, but it's never given as the scene is cut from the final story. All we know is that Mitsuha's father is aware of the dreams and, quite possibly, had taken part in them at some point in his early years. Whether it was his wife in those dreams or someone else, we don't know, but Taki and Toshiki share some sort of bond. They are linked, and that carries more weight than anything else in the show save for the bond between Mitsuha and Taki.
Here's another example: Anyone who has seen this movie knows about the humorous montage sequence set to the beat of the Radwimps pop song Zen Zen Zense in the first act. It occurs somewhere before the halfway point and depicts Taki and Mitsuha switching bodies over and over again struggling to adapt to the situation and causing each other distress in the process. Seeking to keep their lives as in tact as possible, they set rules for each other and attempt to follow through, but fail in the process. It's a funny sequence, but that montage was not originally supposed to be a montage. Rather, it was originally supposed to be fully realized chapters of each other's lives. You can understand the story behind them, but a lot of the romantic and character development is lost between the two protagonists in the process.
Let me elaborate further: Towards the beginning of the movie, because Mitsuha lived and grew up in Itomori, a small Japanese lake town, they don't have a lot of the fancy shops and restaurants that you'd find in larger parts of Japan, such as Tokyo. Itomori doesn't even have a cafe anywhere near it, so Mitsuha and her girlfriend, Sayaka, both dream of one day visiting one.
Now, we also know that Taki, in his real life, works at a fancy Japanese restaurant. So, one day when Taki switches bodies with Mitsuha, since her friends can't visit a real cafe, he decides to build one himself. He saws through the wood, builds them a table with chairs and an umbrella, and basically creates their own little slice of heaven at one of their favorite resting spots. What a champ! He plays the role of their waiter and gives them a part of the cafe experience. It isn't much, but it's such a sweet little moment that's only present in a montage. If it were properly told, it would have only bolstered the already fantastic characters and story to even greater heights.
So when the protagonists finally realize that they had fallen in love with each other, while it's emotional and spectacular, it still feels very sudden because a noticeable chunk of the development is missing, locked behind a montage.
Your Name, upon it's release and subsequent critical acclaim was being compared to the likes of Ghibli Studios, which is arguably Japan's greatest animation production studio to date! Upon hearing this, the movie's director, Makoto Shinkai actually pleaded with people to lower the bar and said that he believed this movie was ""incomplete,"" and I can see why! The story is excellent, but it would've been even better if he had more time and money to finish the rest of the story the way he originally intended, but alas, it's not the movie we got.
I'm not saying that montages are bad. They aren't. As I said, the story is the best part, but they are an inferior method for developing characters rather than say, actually developing characters through the story. If everything else about this movie wasn't as masterfully crafted, it would have been the element that was holding it back, but thankfully everything is great enough that it doesn't drag it through the mud as much as it should have.
CONCLUSION:
Your Name is deservedly and widely considered to be one of the greatest anime films ever created! Despite it's obvious flaws, the shows strengths more than make up for the issues and elevate it above the rest of it's competition. I don't believe there is a single romance anime out there that can compete with this movie. I've seen romance anime before, and honestly, they’re not that good. This is the only anime romance I truly enjoyed.
I sat my mother down to watch this movie. She hates pretty much all anime (and I don't blame her), but Your Name ended up being one of her favorite movies of all time!
So, as surprising as this must be, Your Name gets the highest possible score of 10/10! (* shock, Gasp. So unheard of!) It is a masterpiece: a must-see for anyone, even if you don't like anime or romance. If you haven't already seen this movie, I would highly recommend you at least give this movie a try one time. You may think it's overrated at the end, but I'd be surprised if you didn't at least think it was good.

                The best anime movie your boy have seen and probably will ever see. Everything just worked out really good. The music fitted perfectly to the movie and the situations. The movie had its plot twists and it was really hard to predict what is gonna happen next and thats why its a GOOD movie. THe movie puts you in a trance, it makes you focus on one thing. THe ending was good, but could have been better, would love too see the 2 main characters mitsuha and taky interact more. But this movie made me realise what love really is, and made me envy this
                  feeling between the 2 charachters. Because not everyone will have that same emotion. And do i need to talk about the visuals? It speaks for itself.
Conclusion: Overall a beautiful movie, that can even make a emotionless person like me, to see the beauty of love and the feeling of looking for someone to complete you.",10,Kazooo

                The story of this anime is great, one of the best if not the best stories I have watched in a while.
The art is pretty solid, I pay more attention the characters but the art didn't deter me like some anime.
The music melds perfectly with the actions.
The way the main characters interact with each other and the secondary characters is great. The subtle nods here and there are what easily are putting this in my top 5.
Overall I could not have enjoyed this anime more. It started off in a weird spot then built into something i could never have imagined. If i could give

                {SPOILERS}
Okay, I watched Kimi No Na Wa, and im sorry to say but its lacking character development. It was short which i like because it wasn't the most entertaining story line out there (No offence). I dont' get the hype around and would not recommend it anyone I know.
{Story 6/10}
The story was lacking and somewhat cliche. It started out alright, but quickly turned into something like Erased. One of the protagonists die, and the other protagonist goes back in time to try and avoid this happening. 
The only good thing that I wasn't expecting was when I found out that Mitsuha was actually already dead
                  and her timeline was 3 years before the present.
But that was quickly washed away with the frustration I felt that they just took so long to figure out who they were and I was seriously hating the ending because of the ignorance.
{Art 9/10}
Beautiful art! Its colour scheme is so asthetic and Its really nice. I have nothing against it and its one of the only good things this anime has to offer.
{Sound 10/10}
Sound was really good too. They had music playing at just the right moments and even though I didn't really enjoy the movie, It made me feel a little sad. If there were no music i would have felt no pity for any of the characters. 
{Character 5/10}
Bad Characters! It was such a short movie you couldn't get attached to the characters at all. They rushed character development and you can't just force someone to feel pity if 20 minutes ago you just met them. Like, they are realizing they are switching bodies then 4 minutes later out of no where the protagonists love each other like what??
{Enjoyment 5/10}
I got bored around the middle of the movie, which really shouldn't happen because of how short it is. The stories end didn't make me feel bad or happy it made me feel frustrated. It was showing Takis struggle but why? As far as im considered he had a good life. Friends, Entertainment, Cafes, A date. He didn't really need to switch and thats what made it lacking.
{Overall 6/10}
I would not recommend this anime to anyone. It was okay but nothing that made me sob or contemplate after i had finished it. It left no lingering emotions and thats a sign to me that I didn't enjoy it.",6,Cyxnnn

                THIS, is my kinda movie.
It's everything I want.
It had the absolute most satisfying ending to anything I've ever watched. Biggest smile on my face. I was so curious at every point in the movie, how it was going to turn out, and that's something I normally don't struggle with. I can usually at least predict the next scene. Not at all with this story.
The exchange between the main characters were so real yet ethereal at the same time. A perfect mix of fiction and non-fiction. I got nervous at points because I'm used to being prepared for confusion, but everything just connected so seamlessly it
                  almost surprised me. Not that there are never questions, but everything is answered in the most satisfying way, and there are subtle questions that linger - but in a good way. I enjoyed not knowing some things, even until the end.
I can see why this movie is doing so well. It's an often overused idea - two people switching places, but WOW. It was finally done in a serious way that didn't feel cheesy. The animation was stunning, and I love RADWIMPS so the music really touched me. 10/10 easy.",10,Clamiku

Your name or ""kimi no na wa"" as it's called in Japanese, is the latest movie by the great visual director and writer Makoto Shinkai. Makoto Shinkai is famous for his previous works such as ""5 cm per second"" and ""garden of words"". I've seen both of them and the animation is some of the best I've ever seen, but I feel like they both got similar problem with pacing, story and characters. I was uncertain going into ""your name"", but Makoto Shinkai has really outdone himself with this one. The story follows two high school kids who's never
                  met, that gets united through their dreams. This movie may just be the best anime movie of 2016 with stunning imagery and an investing and original plot, great characters, great music and great pacing.

now, I will not explain the visual side of this, its simply obvious the director, did a stunning job, yet again I cannot simply like it.
as much as a good visual animation with bright comets and remote craterlikeshaped with trees and lakes in the middle of it with other stuning views you can add, I  simply find the story describable with two words: Plot Convinience.
as easy as that, not original,  illogical and unexplained, simply ""dreadful"". its quite bad, yet, the visual part adds some points and I personally enjoy good sound a lot, so as much of a cliché fanserviceable trying to

The movie has great art and story combining with beautiful sound gives  a whole package of excitement. The movie deserves a 10 out of 10 rating but if there was an 11/10, then this one deserves it.

                Your Name: A spoiler free review.
  You wake up alone. Just you. No one else around. Not that you've never felt it before, but the feeling of sleeping alone is becoming all to familiar. You forget what it's like to touch. But you gotta get up right? Gotta get in that uniform, get to where you have to go. Make it there in time. Time is of the essence after all. You do your work. Get it done. You lay back down in that bed of yours. Again. Alone. But your thoughts are there. They are all that's there. They yearn for something more.

   I admire a story that can do this to a person. While I'm watching this film of these two people, desperately trying to reach another, answer questions on who they really are, I start to think the same. Not because they brought it up. Not because the story force fed me a monologue on how life is a sand box for the willing. I thought of this because I felt like them. Taki especially. Things in life you want. Places, people, you feel as though you're supposed to know and yet can't seem to figure it out. I think it's safe to say we all feel like that from time to time. Maybe even more than that.
   This perfect score is a little different. This review and the reviews I do are also a little different. Plot, style, technique, pace, color, acting etc... these are all very important when crafting a story. Especially a film. But what does it have to say? What does the piece of work, that another person made have to say about the world. About themselves. About yourself. People can argue that the ""Enjoyment"" category can cover this but I review on raw emotion. Did this piece of work have something to say? or did it just speak what it had to. It had something to say alright. The title is another great example of a masterpiece. A metaphor for what's to come. A piece that says ""You're up!"" a piece that doesn't ask you to live your life, but to have something to say about it. Even if it's just your name to the greatest person you'll ever meet.",10,paper-tapes

                This movie already has dozens of reviews on this site alone, but the differences in opinion surrounding them baffle me, so I was prompted to write a review that will hands-down encourage anyone considering watching this movie to give it a try.  In that regard, I firmly assert that it has earned the lofty 9.3 score it currently holds on this site at the time of writing this review.
First, the story:  I WILL NOT GIVE SPOILERS, so rest assured.  However, I will say that the story earns a 10/10 for the writing and thought put into it, regardless of my opinion on
                  whether I liked the story or not.  It holds all of the essential elements found in good storytelling.  The pacing keeps the watcher engaged and doesn't leave questions unanswered, and at no point is there ever any ""filler"" scenes between the meat and potatoes of the story.  Every event serves a purpose that ties the film together.
The art rated a 9/10 for me.  There was nothing that made me think, ""wow, they outdid themselves with that cut,"" or left an impression that will stick out in my mind, but given the realistic setting, that's fine.  In the same breath, it certainly doesn't leave one wanting. For an anime, this is one of the better examples of animation quality.
The sound was the same as the art for me.  It was all done very well, the effects, voice acting and the soundtrack, but it won't win awards for it.  It feels natural though, and doesn't overshadow the art or story, which is probably a good thing.
The characters are well-written, especially the main duo.  I kind of feel I can't adequately review them without spoilers though, so I will simply say that they were enjoyable and relatable and leave it at that.
I gave the enjoyment factor a no-questions 10/10 like I said earlier in the review.  I can't wait to rewatch this movie.  It sounds cheesy, but I laughed, I cried and I empathized with the characters.  I even felt frustration when the characters felt it, and felt their desperation when they felt it. At several times I found myself holding my breath in anticipation, or full-on shouting at my computer for such and such character to do such and such thing.  A culmination of everything put into this film snatched away my control over my own emotions and practically forced me to feel what it wanted me to.  It was incredible.
Overall, I rate the film 10/10 mostly from the amount of enjoyment I received from it, and the quality/type of story it told.  There were plenty of ways this movie could have fallen short given the type of story that it set out to tell, and I don't think it fell short at all in any of those ways. It skyrocketed into my top 5 stories I've seen in anime, and I highly recommend watching it if you are at all interested in the genres listed on it.  Give it a watch, I am confident you will not be disappointed that you did.",10,Achaemus

                all i got to say this is a classic.
it was a great movie and it broke the boundaries of anime.
real tear jerker and i know if Jah was still here he would have cried also. now I do not know if this was the best anime ever but it was real good. it might seem confusing at first but when that twist hits its all over. jaw dropping I made me start going down the path of sad/wholesome anime like your lie in April, a silent voice. honestly i should not have watched those just too sad ya feel. this was the one of the
                  first anime I watched this was a big mistake because it was so good I have to compare everything else to it. anime is not good for people and for me because it has been putting these ideas about humans and life that i should not have in my head. this is just like Lord Henry in The painting of Dorian grey that is anime to me. i have been thinking about taking a break from anime recently because i dont need a god damn cartoon making me feel these feels yurd. i need to listen to soulja boy or something idk. young draco is making the biggest comeback of 2019 anyway.",9,biglou1

                I'm a lesbian girl who can't watch a minute of a straight romance anime, but I enjoyed this movie, I enjoyed it a lot!
That's the biggest compliment I can give to a straight romance anime, ever.
The characters were great, the animation was pretty, I didn't feel bored while watching, not even for a second, and as I do in emotional anime: I cried.
Another huge compliment from me: as much as I'm a huge yuri fangirl, and I'd absolutely love a yuri anime with this quality and budget, from a certain point on, from where the film really started to spread its wings I felt like
                  ""You know what? I don't want this to be a yuri. This is perfect the way it is.""
I hope you didn't get weirded out by my heavily lesbian- and yuri-filled review, and I hope you found it at least somewhat useful!

                Have you ever had the feeling where after watching something you've felt like you've reached a level that surpassed enjoyment and just feel a sense of heaviness? Well I had with this movie. As a person who wasn't event into anime at that time, I went into the movie blind, not knowing what type of movie it even was. All I knew was that the song Zenzenzense from the movie was a banger of a song and that the YouTube comments section was squealing of how good the movie is. Thus I went to watch this movie. And oh how I wished I watched this
                  masterpiece sooner. Never in my life had I experienced something so impactful by a movie. The tear-jerking plot, the rich and beautiful soundtrack, and of course the stunning visuals all makes the movie hit different from all the rest. Describing how god damn good the show is and even my own emotions from watching the movie would be an impossible task because it would be beyond my writing ability to describe it. In fact the movie was so good that I have gone out of my way to write this review which is the first movie review I have ever written. For those of you who are still wondering what kind of movie this is because all I have done so far praising it extravagantly, allow me to explain. First of all, Your Name is a romance school anime which just by typing the three words ""romance school anime"", makes me cringe a little since it automatically makes people assume it would just be another typical shoujo anime––but its not. It's the body switching concept that added a whole new element leading to many potential possibilities in the plot which gave the chance for the movie to separate itself from the cliche corny shoujo anime. And Makoto Shinkai delivered. The romance in this movie was also very wholesome and sentimental without even having the two characters kissing each other, which is impressive considering how most shows and movies would just resort to having the characters kiss in order to show that sentimental feeling. I'd always thought that romance was always something that would make a show or movie corny, but the way this movie delivers it makes me think otherwise. Let's face it, the reason why most of us watch anime in the first place is for the sake of escapism, and the visuals and sound design of Your Name definitely did help me escape the boring world I was in (which was during quarantine) and immersed me to its beautiful world (something a lot of isekai shows fails to do). If you ever heard from others of how food in anime looks more appetising than food in real life, this movie definitely proves this statement. The building in the movie looked really detailed and spectacular that it had gotten me a new appreciation of high rise buildings. Literally every single frame from the movie can be a background wallpaper, thats how good the visuals are. The song Zenzenzense also encapsulates the busy city of Tokyo and the song Sparkle encapsulates mystery and wonders of the comet which is a crucial part to the plot. If you remembered what I said at the beginning of this review of how I wasn't into anime at that time and noticed how I have more days in to watching anime in my account page, its because of how good this movie is that I wanted to get that same experience I got from this movie. Unfortunately, this movie does not have a good rewatch value and the enjoyment you get from rewatching would never be as breathtaking as watching it for the first time since the plot is easily spoiled if you already know whats gonna happen so make sure you go watch this movie blind like I did.",10,LegendaryUltra

This is literal perfection. It is impossible to put in words how amazing this movie is, but I will try my best.
When I watched this show I was very doubtful on how good was. I heard for from and online source that is a great movie and a must see for anime lovers, along with it being #17 in ratings. However after I watched it I was blown away. It made me feel a combinations of different emotions that I can't really describe, it actually gave me a adrenaline rush. 
I feel in love with characters and rooted for
                  them throughout the film, the story was compelling to watch play out. The art was absolutely beautiful the best I have ever seen in a movie.

                Your Name or Kimi no Na Wa is what I would personally call a masterpiece. Its been a while since something as brilliant as film has touched my heart and reminded me about my past. The film revolves around 2 that have great significance:
The first being ever having the feeling of yourself missing someone or something. This is referring to the invisible ribbon which is the idea of meeting the person you are destined to meet by fate.
The other one is about referring to Japan's disaster which occurred in 2011, Shinkai chose to add disaster to the plot to make you ponder the question while
                  watching this film: ""what if a disaster like the one in Japan could be prevented?' 
This film also compared the life modernism to traditionalism which can be seen through the two character's day to day life.
The emotions, bonds and ideas in this film can be seen through the landscapes since many of the feelings are expressed by image and actions.
The supernatural characteristics in this film could really make you careless since you would be too busy paying attention to heart warming feeling than the plothole, even though they aren't very distracting. The audience may find the supernatural element to be very confusing, which is understandable since the film could've gotten a little more in depth into explaining it.The audience will be left with putting all the pieces of this film into chronological order and after they do so, they will understand why it is such a amazing work of what it is trying to show the audience.
Overall, I myself agree with plenty of other reviewers and Shinkai himself that this project could be have been even better if the length was extended and if the group didn't run low on budget and was given more time to work on it.",10,WinterAlt

                When I read the synopsis, I thought ""Huh... this might be halfway decent..""  However the synopsis does not do this movie justice!!!!!!! I've never found an anime that made me feel like this one does!! Absolutely stunning!! There are no words... My review also fails to do this movie justice... So much better than I imagined it would be. 
Reasons behind this are as follows: The artwork is stunning. The characters are much like most other anime drawings. the landscape however makes the movie. It gives it life, and makes you come to feel as though you belong there.. 
I havent found another story
                  like this one. It's very unique in my opinion. I was not expecting the plot twists that happen over the course of the movie. Just when you feel like the whole story is ruined it makes a comeback!! 
The characters were lovable, and very easy to relate to. Like most high school students with jobs and relationships and friends... 
I enjoyed this movie wholeheartedly. I actually felt anxiety towards the end because I wasn't sure how the movie was going to end.. One change in how any of it went and the whole story could have been swayed in an entirely different direction. I laughed, felt sad, hated this movie but it exceeded my expectations on how a story could go. 10 out of 10 all the way.",10,Sagrilli2

                I just finished watching Kimi no Na Wa and it seriously is a stupid film; a shitty film. Even without the hype, I'm pretty sure I would've still judged it as stupid.
I'm pretty sure that I've read a premise that's like the premise of the movie - two people exchanging their bodies to live as the other. Like the movie, it was also a romance type of story but it wasn't idiotic like that of Kimi no Na Wa. 
Kimi no Na Wa's premise is definitely interesting. What would actually happen if two strangers, from two far away places, exchange their bodies? What would develop
                  between the two? How would it affect their lives in the present and in the future? How would it affect the lives of other people around them? There are so many interesting things that you could do with the premise and in the beginning, the movie did have some of the things I've thought of. The problem is, that wasn't the point of the movie. And because it wasn't the point of the movie, it was done in a very lazy manner. As such, it just killed my mood for the show instantly. 
The two protagonists acting weirdly every now and then? Present. How were they received by other people? Positively. How much time were they presented to the audience? Oh, just a minute or two. But it was still believable, right? Definitely not! 
The two protagonists having no memories of the body they possesed? Present. Where they still able to cope up with their every day lives? Yes. How much time were they shown to the audience? Just some scenes here and there. But it was still satisfying, right? Absolutely not!
And this last one is the one that I definitely was disappointed the most. Basically, how they fell in love with each other. It was not shown. At least for the other two problems I had with the show, there were some scenes that showed them, this love development, on the other hand, doesn't have one. It was just told to the audience! This is like the foundation of the show! They should've shown things properly, right? So why did they not show it!
Then things happen. They suddenly stopped exchanging their bodies, date & time is different between the two, magically exchanged their bodies again because the show said so, without real explanation, just some superficial ones that wasn't even hinted at all, and more sh*t, and blah blah blah. 
Basically, characters, 4/10, and story, 2/10.
Now, for the good parts. 
Like any other Makoto Shinkai anime, the visuals are spectacular. Animation is fluid, character designs are good, and backgrounds, alright. Directing is great. I didn't look too much on it. 9/10
The sound section is definitely a good one. Even before watching the movie, I was already listening to its soundtrack due to a roommate of mine listening to one of its songs back then. And so I just also listened to it since the song was catchy. Perhaps, because I can’t use my headphones (jack something of laptop is destroyed), I was not really able to listen to weaker background music, but from those I’ve heard, they are great! There might be scenes that I think needed some background music for better feeling but meh. It was already great so 9/10. 
Enjoyment: I was enjoying it until the third problem I mentioned. I just somewhat just lost a part of my interest with the show but there was still a little bit of enjoyment, even until the end. 6/10
Conclusion: A movie that surely should have been better if it was a serialized one since the characters and the story are horseshit in the movie. If it was a tv series instead, characters would have improved quite a lot (a 2 or 3) but for the story section, an addition “one” would already be generous. It’s just another easily digestible movie with bad writing but entertaining nonetheless. 5/10

                When this movie was first announced, and I heard it was going to be directed by the same guy who did Five-Centimeters per Second, I had very high expectations for it and fair enough, it pretty much exceeded those expectations. I saw Five-C and loved it and was hoping for more. 
THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS. READ AT OWN RISK.
I cannot express any much more than absolute enjoyment for this film, and apparently I pretty much have the same exact taste as everyone for those who rated this film 10/10 and made it #1 on MAL. 
The story begins with two teenagers of the same age
                  who have been dreaming of each other. That very moment where Mitsuha witnesses the comets falling for the first time is where things get screwy when we finally realize the truth to what's been happening. 
Story - 9/10
Taki and Mitsuha begin to forget each other and soon, they meet. Although one flaw I noticed is why they both started experiencing these phenomenons. Could the comet have been the source? We don't know, and I'm a little irritated they never got into that point. But nevertheless, their hopes and dream to meet each other finally came when Taki visits Itomori. Taki and Mitsuha work together from out of time to prevent the deaths of Itormori Town. 
Art - 10/10
The film had first made its world premiere at the 2016 Anime Expo this summer, before having its Japanese premiere later in August. Although the version I watched was actually the DVD screening showed at AX, before they posted online, the art was so-so. Probably because it wasn't exactly the Blu-Ray. But even so, I have heard from others who actually saw the premiere that the art was fantastic. 
Sound - 10/10
I wasn't focused on the OST itself, but rather the music provided by the band RADWIMPS, who performed the theme song for the film, which was very nice. 
Character - 10/10
Both Taki and Mitsuha are very.... VERY different characters. Mitsuha comes from a family of spirit mediums, and is very polite when speaking to others.
Taki however, is just a normal Tokyo schoolboy who we first meet (as himself) as someone who doesn't take time seriously, other than drawing. 
These two very distinct characters, yet they have such good chemistry together.
Enjoyment and Overall - 10/10
Sci-fi is nice. With that genre you could literally do anything that normally wouldn't be humanly or scientifically possible. If you add in a sci-fi element to a romance, then anything is possible. Normally Taki and Mitsuha would never have met. But the comet and the body-switching made it all possible. Something that wouldn't be expected, becomes reality. 
This film is certainly a good watch. After all, it's Makoto Shinkai, the one who did 5-Centimeters. I nearby cried on that film, and I almost did here too.",10,Skywarior01
32281,"
                Wow, I didn't expect such a strong pull on my heart strings here. Regardless of the ending of this film I felt pleased. All I can say is if you aren't repulsed by romance then definitely watch this. There's no reasonable reason to not watch this. If that makes sense.
Anyways this is my second Anime, the first Anime Film I've viewed. I was pleased to see it was a full length feature, with an average film run-time. Time is filled with full enjoyment from beginning to end, with focus on the correct character or activity without filler. It certainly isn't the most revolution setting but
                  the execution was not flawed. 
Story I give a 9 of 10. I couldn't have been more vulnerable or sensitive during this movie, caused by this movie. I am a masculine man, I lift, I do manly things and I pride my body hair but this turned my heart to jelly. I wish the ending could have brought myself solace with my own issues but in the end the characters are left without the viewer's pain which is a decent enough-for-me ending. 
Art was at least 8 of 10. As my second Anime I liked the way it was illustrated, although sometimes proved inconsistent. I'm unsure what real connoisseurs in the animated arts are looking for, but I liked it. 
Sound was 7 of 10. & is my standard of not too weird, not inconvenient, and isn't noteworthy. It was subbed, I cannot speak on behalf of those viewing dubbed. Run of the mill sound.
Characters were 8 of 10. There was confusion in the main character's friends I've had, but I feel like it doesn't matter in the end. I generally enjoyed the characters and each character was utilized in some way, so not really any unneeded extras. 
On enjoyment, I'll slap a 10 of 10 up there. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I didn't know the premise, or anything other than the cover going in.I was displeased when it ended and I wound up back in my reality, a world without changing tropes and true love.

                wow, do i really have to say more than this... just wow. There aren't really many words to describe it... just wow, amazing, outstanding, superbly beautiful, 9/10 will cry, even if you are a very tough kind of person emotionally like i am (i never cry in funerals for example) you WILL cry watching this. 
You know, i find it very hard to give a meaning to life, and after years of investigation i found that moments of happiness and learning, learning whether it is morally or in other ways, to be the main goals of life. Happiness has many ways to be achieved, by
                  helping others or by experience. At least that's the way i think about it. And if you want to get those kind of amazing experiences... just watch this movie. I would advise you to:
-pick up that girl/guy you like and ask him/her to go with you watch this movie. Because it's going to tear him/her up emotionally and it's going to give you an amazing experience.
I watched this movie alone though, and i can see why it has such an high rating on mal and i dare to say it should have it even higher, there's no way a movie like this can be disliked unless if it's someone who purposely wants to dislike it. 
The way it's built is amazing. The inner relationship between the two persons who are the same is amazingly well done and props for the drawers they deserve to be congratulated, this movie has some amazing art that rivals studio ghibli. The story follows two high school kids (typical from anime) who wake up at random different days in the same body, basically switching their souls to two different bodies. From there they try to find who is the other person and why they are switching bodies but in such a way that makes it seem it is not really a drama or a anything we've ever seen... you could call it a drama but it's so quiet and peaceful and at the same time so powerfully emotional everyone should watch it. A masterpiece like i've never seen before.
ABOUT THE COMPARISON WITH SPIRITED AWAY
I watched spirited away yesterday for the first time and now i've watched this movie and i was somehow compelled to write a review about this movie but not about spirited away. The two movies are probably to the general opinion the greatest anime movies (if not of all animated movies ever created, both 2d or other genres, but that opinion isn't so popular) ever created. I must say, spirited away is unexpectedly cute and it's not scary for someone over 12 at all. It is a mix of magic and reality and it is one of the few movies (together with kimi no na wa of course) that really transport the viewer to inside the movie, like if we were really there watching. Both are, however, different because the first is focused on fiction with a bit of reality and the other on reality with a bit of fiction. Both of them deserve perfect score from me in all ways, although both kind of lack in the sound. If i had to pick one i wouldn't, simply as that.
Do i recommend it? the movie has very few flaws if no flaws at all in my opinion, and right now i can't think of anything i didn't like besides the songs (they weren't really god knows level) but who wants pop songs in a movie like that? So i rate it: flawless. 
I NEVER RECOMMENDED SOMETHING SO PASSIONATELY IN MY LIFE, SO PLEASE WATCH IT, IT'S PERFECT!!!!
EDIT: -1 to the sound and story and -2 to the characters.  The characters were actually pretty bad  and unoriginal and the sound was pretty average actually. The story wasn't perfect put i still liked it very much and i still loved the movie and thought like i was having an never before eyegasm after watching but now so many days after, i compare it to other movies and i'm like ""meh, not as good as spirited away and the dissappearence of suzumiya haruhi"".

                Man, this anime had so much potential but it really did not deserve the praise it got.
This is a common theme of Makoto Shinkai's, being that he makes romance anime movies. He is one of the best at this category, but it misses out on so much.
In summary, this movie is basically about a young girl and a young boy who switch bodies on random days starting after the first comet fall in Japan after 1000 years. 
Story (Concept): 9
The story was amazing. They put a lot of detail into it, and it really came out well. They had planned a lot into this movie,
                  and it really paid off. I read the plot synopsis and was instantly hooked. The concept for the movie was amazing, and it was one of the first creative anime plots I have ever seen. Unlike the typical romance anime, the story also had other major points, like the religious part with the Musaba god (I think that was his name at least).
Art: 10
The art style, just like all of Makoto Shinkai's other works such as 5 Centimeters a Second and the Garden of Words, is amazing. The style is the same, but still eye catching. The sights are beautiful, the characters are cute, and everything about the art is simply exquisite. I would rate it 11 if possible.
Sound: 10
Again, like the past works of Makoto Shinkai, the sound is amazing. RADWIMPS is a good band, and they really put together some good music for the opening and ending. It's sad none of the other pieces by RADWIMPS are very good. 
Characters: 3
As before, this is very iconic to Makoto Shinkai. But, this is where it falls apart. The story concept is amazing, and I would do love to see this in a 12-episode anime. But, it missed out on so much. Because of the time limit on movies, he did not really spend enough time with connections to the characters. Though we do get partially emotionally connected, the fact that we really only see them and not what they do, or much of their families and friends, makes it feel kind of lacking in the connection. The ending was supposed to be very sad but also happy, but I was just sitting there like, ""Wait that's as far as they went with character development?"" This is quite common in ALL of his other works. Take, for example, the Garden of Words. It is a really touching story, but in the end, we don;t find out much about the characters, and we don;t see their relationship develop very well until a sudden development in the end. And again we see this here. The two characters just seem to be going along their lives when suddenly it is revealed that they really like each other, or they really want to see each other, or something along those lines. It is so typical, yet still so sad because it had so much potential.
Enjoyment: 7
I think one of the things that made this movie not a 10 for me is the fact that it was so hyped. Overall, I still enjoyed it quite a bit, but it missed out on SO MUCH.
Overall: 7
I still think this is a good movie, just it was overhyped, and not as good as many people see it. I think of it kind of like SAO. It was so hyped, and many watched it, but in the end, it was overdone, and missed out on a lot of potential, even though both of their music was good, and the art style was wonderful.
Please don't criticize me too harshly. This is my own opinion, and you are free to have your own, though you are free to correct me if you see any errors in facts.",7,willster88

                After a painfully long wait, Shinkai Makoto's huge hit, Kimi no Na wa has made it to theaters and I was fortunate enough to be able to watch it on its debut. This will be my first review on MyAnimeList and that is because of my strong feelings for this film. These ratings are subjective so feel free to disagree, but I genuinely stand by my thoughts. 
Story [8]- The story is set in Japan when comet Tiamat, has been expected to fall. This brings an uproar to all the folks, as they're about to witness something that comes every thousand years. At the same
                  time, the female protagonist Miyamizu Mitsuha is introduced with desires of becoming a handsome guy in Tokyo. As expected, she swaps bodies with the male protagonist Tachibana Taki, a hardworking student in high school. The series is classified as a Sci-Fi, Romance: a genre that may seem overused. However, for anyone who knows Shinkai Makoto, his depiction on romance has always been cliche and cheesy, but is executed oh so perfectly. The romantic tension has included drama that can only be described as fascinating. My opinions speak strongly, believing that Shinkai Makoto is one of the very few directors that can make cliche animes entertaining.
Art [10]- Shinkai Makoto has done it again. With him directing this film, (or any other film) it immediately signals to the audience that his cinematography would be stellar. The art is gorgeous and accurate; from realistic scenes, to the luscious forests of Japan. The hand-drawn animations are beautiful as it provides a soft; natural mood that gives you shivers throughout your body. The animations and camera movements are also smooth, as some scenes are really highlighted, through the actions of traditional dances and breath-taking comets. The film itself is definitely worth watching just for the artistic elements. 
Sound [8]- To be honest, I was not feeling the band 'RADWIMPS' when I first heard their songs in the trailers. However, that has come to change: The variety of voices that are heard between the theme songs are so powerful. The soundtracks were also good, as every track fits perfectly throughout the different scenes of the movie.
Character [7]- Both Mitsuha and Taki are generic, but likable characters. Although they lack detail and experience lifestyles that we could only imagine, their development invokes empathy from the viewers. They are realistic and contain humane emotions that we feel on a daily basis. The side characters, however, feel underdeveloped. They do not stand out and ultimately feel irrelevant. Every single character could've had more development, which may have provided a stronger connection between the audience and characters.
Enjoyment [10]- Despite the flaws I've found throughout the anime, it does not- I repeat NOT- take away my enjoyment factor whatsoever. The roller coaster of emotions felt throughout the anime is something that I wont be experiencing anytime soon. The story may not have had been the greatest, nor have had the deepest of characters, but it has set standards for the anime genre. This enhances the potential of all anime production, as we the audience, hope to experience more often. To watch it in theater was a whole new experience. 
Overall [10]- This anime is not perfect by any means, but it is an experience that I can only describe as life changing. We all have an anime that we've really felt a connection with, having a deeper impact on us for any reason. This is the anime that reached my heart. The attachment that I've had with this anime has made me overlook the slight flaws and realize that perfection shouldn't be depicted out of a series that is meant to entertain. Calling a series perfect is subjective and it's only natural for opinions to differ. This film touched my heart and not my mind, making it stand out to me. It has achieved every one of my standards and there is so much for me to say and love about this film that I wouldn't change a single thing about it. The dichotomy of two star-crossed lovers thinking heartily about one another brings the adolescent feeling that has left its mark in my heart, enhancing my love for anime. All in all, this anime is a masterpiece and I strongly recommend everyone to give it a shot.",10,WowNice
32281,"
                I've seen plenty of anime after people hyping them up to no end and it's nothing new for me to watch a title that doesn't live up to the hype but this movie goes beyond that. Shortly after hitting the theaters it became a huge success, most grossing anime movie of all time and number one on MAL (doesn't say much but still, it illustrates the hype around it). I even saw people who went to theaters over and over again to rewatch it up to 10 times or even more! I have friends that bought the special editions and all that. 
Now I didn't
                  go into it expecting to be blown away, neither did I do in to be a smug asshole to tell everyone how bad the thing they love is but I did expect more than a very mediocre mix of drama and romcom. 
Story: Kimi no na wa is a touching take about a city boy and a village girl swapping bodies with silly shenanigans that arise from it and,  uhh... time travel... and comet strike disaster subplot that's just there for some reason. It's also about family, friendship, nature and about 5 or 4 other things that can be used to very loosely describe what is actually a very pointless movie. 
I gotta say, this Shinkai guy? Amazing art, his writing? Not so much. He can sorta draft an interesting concept that has a lot of potential but I never saw him properly flesh out any story of his so what he ends up with is a pretty movie with interesting concept but instead of actual plot it's just a string of emotionally manipulative moments that through a combination of appropriate music, beautiful visuals and characters just bland enough to feel bare minimum of sympathy.  
That's the case here. Mitsuha is a village girl who wants to live in a big city, she's a daughter of her village's mayor and uhh... That's about it. She's boring there is nothing to her. Taki or whatever is even more bland, he's a pretty generic Tokyo boy, has a short temper,  wants to be an architect and that is again it, he's dull and evern the ""short temper"" part doesn't even matter a single bit outside of a few comedic bits and one irrelevant scene near the end. 
Do I need to point out why such bland characters are a problem in this kind of movie? Pretty much all good romance has to have interesting chemistry, clash of personalities or just something to make you care about characters and their relationship. Then again I'm not even sure this qualifies for romance in the end cause I've seen movies with throwaway romantic subplots with more romance. Here they just meet through MAGIC, swap bodies for a while and when it stops they are somehow in love with each other and can't live with one another, spending their lives passively searching their other half. It's terrible and I think I said enough to justify my position so let's get to the other part. 
Drama! It sorta just starts maybe hour into the movie when body swap stops so our main guy, unable to accept that he's no longer a girl few times a week, does his best to find Matsuha but when he does we learn something terrible! That's when nonsensical time travel is introduced, I swear to god Shinkai must have a fetish for putting some arbitrary distance between his characters but never actually exploring it. We also get to the comet strike garbage and averting damage is what the rest of the movie is spent on. It's spent on saving the village and characters you don't really care about and resolving the timeline conflict in a way devoid of any tension or thinking. But at least we get a very flaccid happy ending, hurray? 
Art: ten outta ten, this is the first Shinkai movie that's more than just beautiful scenery and pretty characters. This time around there's actually animation around every corner and his use of 3D only gets better with every movie so it looks pretty smooth and natural aside from one shot where camera pans all the way from Tokyo to a remote village. It's an extremely tough thing to do in both 2D and 3D so even though there are minor faults visible here and there it's still very visually impressive. Don't expect mad sakuga, it's not an action movie but for what it is the movie is still absolutely gorgeous. 
Audio: not much to say, a lot of the soundtrack is Radwimps living up to their name. VA is just about standard, I saw someone praise va for making SUBTLE changes when characters are body swapped but it's as fine and subtle as blunt force trauma. If you think that's anything noteworthy watch literally any body swap movie. 
Funfactor: you might think I hated the movie but I didn't. I do think it's about as close to a masterpiece as Stephen Hawking to being a ballet dancer but it's still an entertaining casual watch of you can look at it without analysing any aspect of it.",6,Gundroog
32281,"
                I have a rule to never rate anything below 5 and never over 9. But this movie is one of the exceptions to the rule. 
There is nothing to complain about it, it's very enjoyable, doesn't rely heavily on plot twist to keep you engaged, the characters are not overdeveloped, and we dont linger on side-plots neither. 
Story: It's a short story with a lovable cast and a great, yet predictable, plot.
Ary: The animation is lovely, make yourself a favor and watch it on 1080p +. I was watching it on a browser at 720 and the quality was average, but it kept buffering, so
                  i got it on Bluray instead and watch it for a second time and boy let me tell you, it's basically a different movie.
Sound: The song's lyrics were fitting for each moment, the background music never felt too much or louder than the voice of the characters, and it has some lovely soundtrack, nothing to complain about. 
Character: The cast i lovable, a bit one dimensional, as each one fulfilled just one roll, our main characters on the other hand are perfectly developed for the story, i could like to see more of them in different interaction, but i dont we have enough time to fully developed them in a movie.
Enjoyment: Rewatched it right after finishing it, nuf said.
Overall: I'm a bit of a cynical, that enjoys a bit darker anime, yet i enjoyed this one. It marks all the boxes for a good movie and then it builds into something beautiful, not many movies can deliver in such short run time.",10,bronosh

I watched this on May 6, 2017 at my local cinema. It was getting all the hype and I decided to check it out. Definitely not disappointed.Story: This wasn't the average teenage body-swapping cliche story like I had originally expected. I am a sucker for multiverse/timeline theories with spiritual connections so this was definitely a right fit for me. There were some confusing bits and a couple plot holes that Makoto Shinkai mentioned himself as well, so this is why I cannot give it more than an 8.
Art: Sound:
I cried tears after this movie and got quite emotional just watching the trailer and it came to me that it was most likely the art and music that brought those feelings upon me. Shinkai has said multiple times that he does not want to be compared to Miyazaki, but in this way, I believe they are quite similar as both directors have amazing art + sound in their films that bring forth emotion. Brilliant.
Character: After watching the film, I still haven't felt a connection to either Mitsuha or Taki. In my opinion, we haven't seen enough of the characters prior to the switching. There were sometimes I wasn't sure who was who which confused me a little. Nonetheless, I did feel attachment towards the relationship they had. The strong connection the protagonists had was easily felt by the audience, I'm sure.
Enjoyment: I was not bored at any moment whilst watching, in fact, I was interested in every second.
Overall: 10/10 
Would I watch it again? Yes but not anytime soon. This film moved me in a way I had not expected it to and to watch it again would take away from the first viewing. It's a great film about youth and love. :)",10,Liza

                Kimi no Na wa. is a class act. Easily one of the best anime movies of the decade, Shinkai Makoto has outdone himself yet again.
Story 9/10
The whole concept of time was very nicely executed. The meaty plot is only the tip of the iceberg, however. As the story is played out, different plot elements surface. The pacing was fantastic, rarely missing a beat. My only qualm is the ending, which felt disappointing as there was so much more to achieve.
Art 10/10
The art was beautiful, and the colours used in the scenery was vivid yet soothing. Animation was smooth and refined and you could tell how
                  much effort had been put in through the thoroughness of the hand-drawn animation.
Sound 10/10
The background music was amazing, timed to perfection. The animation and sound synchronized superbly, flaunting the high quality production.
Characters 7/10
Considering they had only slightly more than 90 minutes to work with, the main characters were portrayed nicely, and you could almost feel their relationships blossoming. However, I feel that there was so much more to plunge into, for both the main characters and their friends.
Enjoyment 10/10
Kimi no Na wa. really brought me on an adventure like no other. The progressively deepening story, coupled by the breathtaking art and music, kept me engaged throughout.

Disclaimer: I just got home from the cinema and I feel like ranting to someone about this, hence the existence of this review. If there are any subtle developments that would make me appreciate this film more, I most likely missed it.
Another disclaimer, this is the only other Makoto Shinkai film I've seen, other than 5cm/s. So I'll try my best to review this as a standalone rather than compare it to some of his earlier works.
Story: 7/10
Starting off with the main premise, Kimi no Na wa (Your Name) sounds pretty cliché. Not too overdone, but it's no innovation by any stretch of the imagination. 
This view has been echoed through the hallowed chambers of MAL, but I'm gonna say it right now, nothing plot-heavy happens in the first half of the film. It plays out like, as many have mentioned, the standard romcom (without the rom, which is something I'll get to later). But then in the second half, it tries to through a somewhat coherent but still messy plot at you. Even if you manage to get through the confusion, you're left with a bunch of unanswered questions, in which your best guess at an answer would be ""Gods did it."" which is about as convenient as it gets.
As for the overall theme of the movie, if Shinkai was aiming to get that distance-y feel from 5cm/s (yes I know I said I would look at this as a standalone but ... yeah no I have no excuse), then I would say that while he didn't completely fail in that department, he didn't really capture it either. One can definitely feel a 'so close but yet so far' theme going on (this is especially apparent with the fact that Mitsura DISAPPEARED on Taki, or the other way around), but again, the confusing plot stops us from fully experience that. Is it even possible to appreciate the theme if most of the time we're wondering why the time wibble is breaking? 
Then again I could be entirely wrong and he was going for something completely different, but still.
Art: 10/10
Like Shinkai's other works, every part of the film is pleasing to the eye. I'm no art student so I can't exactly go into specifics as to why the film is beautiful, but pretty much every frame (well not really but you get the point) is begging to be a wallpaper. Visually stunning colour, attention to detail, as well as countless minor but still important features (his use of shadows, the smooth animation etc.) creates Shinkai's trademark eye candy.
Sound: 7/10
Nothing much I can say in this department other than the sound effects did its part in immersing me into the movie's world, and the soundtrack was, although easily forgettable, pretty well done. The VAs did a pretty good job as well, I liked how they put in the effort to sound more masculine/feminine depending on who's in who's body.
Character: 6/10
Oh boy here we go.
First off, let's try dissecting the main characters' personalities. I first thought that the characters didn't really have any defining traits, but upon reflection, their personalities can be pieced together by how the surrounding characters act, and I give credit to the film for doing so. Some of the side characters were developed more than they needed to be as well, especially Tessie.
But my biggest grievance with the film in this field is the supposed romance between Taki and Mitsuha (which is why it lacked the rom, as I mentioned earlier). It's entirely within the realm of possibility that they both developed feelings for each other,  but I can only believe it when you show it to me. Looking back on the film, there were very little scenes where they both directly communicated to each other. Oh, I'm sure that they talk to each other off-screen, but that's the thing, those conversations are off-screen. Viewers would've been better off being shown their conversations because then there's some actual believability to their feelings. 
And to make this worse, there was actual chemistry between Taki and Mitsuha. One example the mid-movie montage, where the banter between the two of them was excellent in showing how they're relationship could grow.
Their rushed relationship and wasted potential are pretty much why character ranks the lowest here.
Enjoyment: 8/10
Despite the film's flaws, I actually enjoyed the experience. The plot was too convoluted for its own good, and the relationship between Taki and Mitsuha was pretty much non-existent due to the fact that we're not shown how they grew to like each other. However, past the movie's gaping holes is a visual marvel with a pleasing soundtrack to go along with it. It might not have been the 10 I was hoping for, but I don't regret watching this movie.
Overall: 7.6/10
Your Name is stunning in terms of its art (as any Makoto Shinkai film would be), but its pitfalls are its complicated and confusing plot, and with poor development between Taki and Mitsuha. And to some, those shortcomings makes this film disastrous, but to others, it doesn't change a thing.
Hope this was good for a first review.",8,funnyname_

                                        A IMP Review of: Your Name (Dubbed edition)
(IMP stands for “In My Prospective”, meaning if someone attempts to correct the way I see the show I have no intention of reading any “corrections”)
Story: Before I get too far into this, this movie is to MAL considered the 2nd BEST anime thus far and I’ve got to say, WHAT?! THAT WAS THE 2ND BEST!? If you’re wondering no i don't think it should be first instead, I don't think this should even
                  be 400th in all honesty! Was it bad? No, but was its ""spectacular""? HELL NO! I can only assume this show is supposed to make people feel for the main 2 characters of the show and how they, throw the most bullshit means get to ""help each other"" to prevent spoilers. But why would I care when we get little to no build up for the characters motivations or personalities (We didn't know jack shit about the guys personality throughout the movie in all honesty), 2, count them 2 montages of them getting to know each other when in the others bodies instead of slowly showing us how they got to connect with one another, and the music scenes in it that sound really upbeat and nothing at all like how the shows basic setting is. The setting is a sort of tragic/romance where the music and the pacing were like an episode of friends like an upbeat slice of life show. Let’s get the ball rolling with my score for the story, 5/10. One might say ""you just complained about it why a 5/10?"" It’s because overall I liked the concept of the story, I think the events regarding them switching bodies was kinda bullshit but I guess in fantasy you can take some stuff from reality and mesh it into an anime to make it seem symbolic. Its pacing was TERRIBLE! It’s a movie for Christ sack, don't do montages, don't do just music scenes, BUILD MY INTEREST IN THE CHARACTERS IN THE SHORT TIME YOU HAVE! Overall throughout the show I enjoyed it enough to not call it terrible, but the chances of watching it again are slim because I was annoyed on the progression and the conclusion of the show.
Characters: There are a few characters that have some importance, mostly the people the main girl of the show knew, the guys friends were just that, the guys friends... The main girl wasn't anything special in terms of personality but she felt, how to put this, real? She was a believable character with Japanese bumpkin shine girl problems. The guy on the other hand was more shaped by the interaction with the girl of which is when we see him then have personality. The main girls’ friends are a guy who believes in the occult whose dad works in something to do with construction and a girl that other than the end was just tagging along with the occult guy so she’s not important. I'd mention the guys 3 friends and 1 girl that he sort of likes but they didn't do enough to make an impact honestly. Overall the occult guy and the main girl are what really give the characters any ground to stand on. The main guy does a lot in the show but ultimately he’s just (insert yourself here) protagonist. Characters 5/10. When I only care about a 2 characters in a show, I can't give it any higher rating. 
Art: Ok, if there's one thing the movie does right, it’s the art. BUT! They a lot of the show sort of force you to acknowledge this fact, there are many panning shots, shots of them looking up at the sky, shots of random scenery, a lot of light effects, etc. PLUS! It’s a movie so the animation usually should be pretty good regardless so because of these factors though it would have gotten a 9/10 in art, it gets an 7/10 instead.
Sound: I believe I mentioned the some about the music portions of this show but here's the rating 3/10. I'm sorry but the sound/music didn't match the atmosphere, was played at times it shouldn't have been, was very memorable, and I honestly didn't like the sounds in all honesty. In terms of background music I didn't notice anything about it to save the rating at all so it won't. 
Enjoyment: Ok, despite a lot of the issues with the show I was invested for at least the end part of the show because thought it was obvious where it was going I wanted to know what happened. 6/10. There's not much more to say about it other than I wanted to see the main girl get what she wanted (to prevent spoilers).
Overall: 4/10. This anime movie was just like most normal non Ghibli anime movies I’ve seen, in fact I think another show I saw that wasn't made by Ghibli might honestly have been better then it and I thought that show was just around the same as this one, The Girl who Leapt Through Time. The main difference between that movie and this besides the art was CHARACTERS DEVELOPMENT! I gave way more shits about Makoto Konno then I did about the character I thought did the best in Your Name Mitsuha Miyamizu because Makoto was given far more time to develop as a character, she had a defining personality and I could care far more about what happened to her then these two for most of Your Name. The supporting cast in that movie was also far better, HELL even though we don't see a major about of development on the guy in TGWLTT he still felt more like a character I gave a shit about then Taki Tachibana. Ultimately what I really want to say about this show is 2nd best on MAL? Really? Maybe I’m getting old and I just don't get it but I will never claim this show to be 2nd best in terms of anime films, or shows. It had good art, and some decent characters and an interesting concept, but overall it was just another typical anime movie that will eventually to me be forgotten.
Let me tell others 2 things, 1: I will not tell you or encourage you to give the same rating, this is just my personal opinion on this show and 2: honestly I’m doing this review and other reviews as a hobby and for my own “anime records” so to speak, so if you see this and don’t like it just ignore it honestly because its more for me then to help others in the long run.",4,SniperKnighter

Kimi no Na wa. is another piece by Makoto Shinkai which highlights his attention to detail and background. Just to kick this review off, the movie was entertaining and kept you at your seat for the first half of the movie, however the story crumbles on itself as we enter the second half of the movie.
Spoilers below:
The setup was great. A light-hearted and comedic scenario that captivated the attention of the viewers. The tone and pacing of the story was well done where it kept the story moving along as well as explored the backstory and history of the characters. As usual from Makoto Shinkai, the art and sound accompanied each other very well.
What I found lacking in this movie is the resolution and almost ""cop out"" feel to the ending just so that we could end on a good note. Despite the dispute between Mitsuha and her father, they were able to resolve their differences in the final minutes leading to the towns destruction. I felt that there was too much left unexplained to really justify/explain why the father changed his mind or if they resolved their differences. In addition, how did they even got to evacuate everyone when there wasn't supposed to be any time left.
I wouldn't really say I had many gripes about the characters themselves, but I find them flat at times.
Just to reiterate, it is a movie definitely worth watching. The pacing of the first half was great, but the attempt to wrap up  such an amazing story really falls flat.",8,myl0h

                I started watching this Anime, when everyone and his dog was already talking about it. I expected my expectations to be waaaay too high because of all the hype that swept and bursted throughout the forums.
I was mistaken. Quite a lot mistaken. This is the most amazing piece of art I was ever allowed to enjoy. Someone must have put his very everything, really every thing he had in his soul into this impressive movie. And many others followed up, contributing to the amazing execution, the immersive Artwork, the vivid voice acting, the fluid and surprising scene composition. Everything about this work screams with all
                  its Might sole Impressiveness. Still, what makes this Anime the unchallenged top of the list is the outright amazing story it tells. And the fact, that everything that happens in the movie is contributing so much to the progression and the detail of that very story. Go watch!
Alright, since MAL tells me, that this Review is not long enough, I keep going with kinda redundant songs of praise for Kimi no Na wa.

The animation is GORGEOUS! Must be seen in 1080p or 4K if possible. The characters are unique and can really make you feel for them and be in their shoes. 
Towards the midway point I was hoping for the best, but the rollercoaster ride began and the feels could not be contained within. From that point forward I was anxiously waiting
                  to see what would happen next because I knew what I wanted to happen, but the plot could have easily gone the other way, and it seemed like that the entirety of the remainder of the film. Up to the last moment, I was like, ""Please, PLEASE! It can't end like this! They have to solve the problem at hand!"" And ofc, the tears came... I can neither confirm nor deny the events that took place in the film for those reading this review, but I can say, tears happen... that is all...",10,Snoopy25

                After watching Your Name, it has become my new favorite movie. The combination of visuals and sound drew me into the story and made me genuinely care about the characters. This was only emphasized by the tragic twist later in the story. All I wanted for Mitsuha and Taki was for them to find each other. It is very rare for me to care about a character that deeply. I think a large part of those emotions were a result of the greater meaning of the story. It wasn’t just another love story; it was showcasing two entirely different lifestyles of people in different parts
                  of Japan while showing how they indirectly affect each other. It incorporated a very literal “us against the world” theme, in which Taki had to take on nature itself to set things right. It also shows how easily parts of history get lost over time yet maintains a positive spin on it by appreciating and preserving the parts we haven’t forgotten. Not only did this film inspire me to believe in love and destiny, but it also encouraged me to follow my own path despite what others say as Taki did to get to Mitsuha. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.",10,kpeterson

Your name is an absolute masterpiece
First I have to adress the art and music, the art is simple to explain, anyone that puses the film at any time will have their breath taken away by the amount of detail put into every scene as well as the smooth and beautifull style of the anymation.
Music is also outstanding, but don't take my worrd for it, as one of the track from the film became a number one hit in Japan with hundreds of millions of views (Shen Shen Shen) and the others such as
                  Sparkle and Nandemonayia are forever engraved into the watchers hearts.
The story is an outstanding portrail of a love hate relationship with paranormal activity stuffed all around it, sure it's a strange concept that takes time getting used too (I won't get into it cause of spoilers), but the mini story arcs inside the film are amaizing as well as complementing the film perfectly, I won't get into the specific arcs because of spoilers, but they are both relatable and beautifull.
Finally characters, they are pretty regular  normal high school students, but they way they are portraid is so accurate that it makes them great. Being adventoruos while at the same time knowing the consequencess of their actions, getting pissed at the tiniest things, having their individual problems and hopes and dreams.... Perfection.
So that concludes my review and I guess it's safe to say that I enjoyed it a bit.",10,Manlikecheese

I've watched ""Kimi no Na wa."" aka ""Your Name."" around December 2019, and it's one of my favorite movies.
The movie isn't very clear and understood at the start, but after all - they cover it very quickly and the movie becomes great.
I liked the movie because of the love story, determination  and music.
The music is perfect.
all of those above make that movie the best movie I've saw so far.
If you watched ""Kotonoha no Niwa"" aka ""The Garden of Words"" you would surely enjoy ""Kimi no Na wa.""
i'd recommend as well to watch ""Tenki no Ko"" aka ""Weathering With You"" a little while after ""Kimi no Na wa""

                Makoto shinkai returns to dazzle us with a relationship-based movie, only this time, the scope is much bigger. 
Analyzing his previous films, such as 5 Centimeters Per Second and Garden of Words, we can clearly see that Makoto gets the nuancies of human interaction, but in these two, the character animation lacks work. 
In this film, however, both the character and the enviroment art are amazing. The details and expression give life to the whole movie and only adds to the experience.
Also, the on-point soundtrack by RADWIMPS is probably one of the best of anime production, as its captures the exact feeling on each scene
                  with a variety of instruments. Perfect example are the opening track ""Yumetourou"" and ""Kataware Doki"".
The story itself is an exaltation to the ""akai ito"" belief, representend in Mitsuha's ribbon, and also to true love that surpasses the boundaries of time and space. The script does fail at some points of silly and unnecessary justification of the ocurring facts, but this flaw is only a speck of dust in the almost perfection that it is Kimi No Na Wa. 
Both the main characters are well developed, especially Mitsuha, with a more focused movie on her side of the story, justified by the concepts that the movie presents, such as ""Musubi"". 
Summarizing, Kimi No Na Wa is probably the best movie Makoto Shinkai has given us up to this point, and is definetly one of the best experiences the anime industry has given us.",10,CallTheEagles

I really enjoyed the anime because it was very unique. There was comedy, sadness, romance, and others all mixed together. Normally, this would be a bit strange if not executed well, but Kimi No Na Wa did it well. The entire was a rollercoaster

The Good - - - 
Art: 
-	Attention to Detail:
I highly appreciate the fact that they put little details in the two protagonists' rooms; Mitsuha's room being fairly organized and slightly cluttered while Taki's room has pictures of architectural buildings and his landscape drawings hung up around the room, indicating later on that he wanted to be an architect. Taki’s friends were also commenting on the design of the cafe they visited, also indicating that they wanted to be architects as well. And as an aspiring architect, Taki built a nice ‘café’ for Mitsuha’s friends whilst in her body. In Mitsuha’s room, it is seen that she sleeps on the floor with a futon, and I have noticed that whenever she is in Taki’s body, she wakes up by falling off his bed. Another detail to point out is their phone models. Mitsuha's phone was an older version while Taki's phone was a newer version, hinting at the 3-year time difference. The dates on their phones both say September 12, but Taki's phone shows Monday, and Mitsuha's phone shows Thursday, again hinting at the 3-year time difference. Another part is when the meteor struck at the end. The camera panned back a few hundred meters back, and there was a delayed sound for the explosion because the sound had to travel. The last detail I want to mention is the red braided cord. Whenever Taki is in Mitsuha's body, he does not wear the red string in 'his' hair; instead, he pulls ‘his’ hair up into a ponytail. Whenever Mitsuha is in Taki's body, she does not wear the red string around 'her' wrist. I'll admit, I didn't catch on to these little details until I re-watched it the second time since I was too wrapped up trying to understand their story-line. But noticing these sorts of details makes you appreciate the amount of work the animators and artists put into these shots.
Sound: 
-	Voice Acting: 
It is interesting to see how the two characters differ in their way of speaking. Mitsuha is mentioned to have 'an accent' which Taki scolds her in their notes to lose the accent. And her choice of words makes Taki’s voice sound awkwardly feminine, and A LOT like Mitsuha’s voice actor. The same goes in the reverse, Mitsuha’s voice actress sounds a lot like Taki’s voice actor when he is in her body. Mitsuha once accidentally refers to herself as 'Watashi' (gender neutral for 'I' although it is perceived as feminine), while males in Japan refer to themselves as 'Ore' towards close friends or relatives (male version for 'I'). 
-	Soundtrack/Music:
As I am writing this, I’ve been listening to the whole Kimi no Na wa album of Radwimps, and I absolutely loved it. I’ve listened to their music before I watched the movie (one being Zen Zen Zen), and the tracks seem to be used in the right place at the right time. 
Characters: 
-	Relatability: 
I, for one, can relate to Mitsuha in some ways. Waking up late with her hair all messy, that’s a definite yes. But when she finally decides to cut her hair after she realizes that Taki doesn’t remember her due to the time differences, that was something I had in common with her; a connection I have. We both cut our hairs because it was a way to release the negative emotions; to let go of something, whether it be a memory, a burden, etc. 
Mitsuha is portrayed as a reserved person with family responsibilities while Taki is portrayed as an outspoken person. It’s understandable how they get along; they balance each other out. I could relate to Mitsuha on a personal level, although I can also relate to Taki as a city kid.
I also noticed that Mitsuha tends to play with her hair when she’s embarrassed, and this is also a habit she tends to do while in Taki’s form to which Taki’s friend described as ‘cute’.
Plot:
-	The Symbolism of the Red Braided Cords:
In Japanese tradition, the Red String of Faith resembles the connection of couples chosen by fate. In the movie, Mitsuha always wore a red string to tie her hair, and we see the use of this symbolic red string brings back the memories of the past for Taki and Mitsuha. Without the red string, Taki, unbeknownst to him, loses connection with Mitsuha, which explains why he woke up in his form, crying.
-	The Hidden Meaning of ‘Suki’:
A question that was lingering in my mind was: why did Taki write ‘I love you’ (suki da) on Mitsuha’s hand? Why couldn’t he just write his name, address, phone number, or anything to get them to stay in contact?
Musubi, the connection of everything, couldn’t erase love because feelings aren’t like memories. In the movie, the Moon was always there. The Japanese word ‘suki’ (love) is incredibly similar to ‘Tsuki’ (moon). Tsukiyomi, the moon god, is the reason for the lingering feelings Taki and Mitsuha have. What Taki wrote on Mitsuha’s hand wasn’t erased by Musubi because, in the end, love conquers all. Love transcends dimensions of time and space.
-	That Scene:
One of my favourite scenes is when Taki comes up with an idea to write each other’s names on their hands. And when Mitsuha is about to write her name on his hand, the pen drops and she disappeared. That has got to be the most gut-wrenching scene in the movie ever.
The Bad - - -
Characters: 
-	Lack of Chemistry: 
The two protagonists have never spoken to each other, only putting down the Do’s and Don’ts in each other’s notes. As someone who is heavily into romance since a young age, I always look for the chemistry between two characters; I always search for the reasons why they might like each other. Of course, they learn about each other from living their different lives, and they start to care about each other which ends up being their motivations to find each other. And yes, I did say that their personalities balance each other out well earlier before, but I never felt like I was watching them gradually fall in love. It felt like it just somehow happened right off the bat, leaving me like “Oh, well that just happened.” I don’t understand how Taki just accepts that he’s in love with Mitsuha after his date with his ‘senpai’ who he has (or used to have) a crush on. 
-	Lack of emotional attachment:
While I do relate to the main protagonists, I wasn’t emotionally attached to them. I can’t really explain their characters other than “She’s a hardworking family girl” and “He’s a schoolboy in Tokyo”. Nothing in their personalities made them really stand out. It just felt like their characters were dull and missing something. 
-	Lack of Character/Character Development:
Taki seems to be underdeveloped, and to me, his character isn’t explored enough especially his objectives and family relationship. This makes it hard for me to relate to him. Mitsuha, on the other hand, seems to have been explored more as a character, but it only brings up more questions. I can see that she seems to resent her shrine duties, but what exactly is her dream? (Other than being a handsome high school boy in Tokyo, of course. I mean the actual goals.) She has mentioned about living in Tokyo, only because country life seems so boring for her which I can empathize with. As far as I know, it seems that her responsibility with upholding the old traditions of Itomori is holding her back from achieving her ‘dreams’ (whatever that may be). 
This brings me to another point. Why does she continue doing these traditions? It couldn’t be that she enjoyed it. Was it for her grandmother’s sake? Or is she forced into doing so? Does she feel pressured into doing so? And what is her relationship with her grandmother? If anything, Taki has a more defined relationship with her grandmother than she does which is incredibly ironic.
The only character development we ‘see’ in Mitsuha is when Mitsuha stands up to her father, but even THAT isn’t shown at the climax of the story which is disappointing. 
Plot:
-	The Flaws:
I couldn’t understand why Taki would keep the red braided cord as a lucky charm around his wrist from someone he doesn’t know at the time. And I couldn’t really understand why the two never bothered to check the dates on their phones when they switched bodies, or how they never noticed in the first place. However, I do understand why because they did mention saying it felt like a ‘dream’, and when we dream, we can’t always remember all the details. And why did Taki’s friend and senpai tag along on his journey to find Itomori? It seemed kind of unnecessary for them to join. And why didn’t their friends question about their strange behaviour and just accepted it as a normal thing? How did Taki forget such an important part of the comet, which was the Itomori tragedy? How did the notes disappear from Taki’s phone, and why did it start to disappear right when Taki reaches the destroyed Itomori? And to mention the final flaw: I felt like the ending could’ve been better. I am slightly disappointed that Mitsuha left Itomori and didn’t continue the traditions her grandmother taught her. After all, her grandmother did mention that it was important for her to continue the traditions since the records of their older traditions were destroyed.
-	The Climax Problem:
Taki, in Mitsuha’s body, attempts to save Itomori and its residents by planting a bomb in the power plant and fake an emergency evacuation. And Mitsuha’s friends are completely in on this plan. Skip to the part where the plan is about to fail and then Mitsuha comes to the rescue by confronting her dad which we don’t even see. And for some reason, he is convinced to evacuate all citizens even though HE was the one who didn’t believe in his own daughter and almost called the mental hospital on her. How on earth? Also, did you really have to go that far to the point where you have to blow up the power plant? 
Writing:
-	The Comedy:
I don’t really get how groping breasts seem so funny. And even after Mitsuha found out and told him to stop doing so, he just continues. Is that…not harassment? Also, when Taki and Mitsuha finally meet, the conversation of that is just brought up just for laughs, and here I thought we were onto something serious. But, hey, I guess it’s just an anime. Still not cool though.
Also: “You’re a girl of marriageable age”- Tessie.
-	Oh, Yeah. That Scene:
There are some scenes to remind you that this is still a clichéd anime. For example, when Mitsuha tries to alert the town, she ends up tripping on a rock and tumbles down the hill in a hilarious yet stupid way. I had to admit that I burst out laughing because of how ridiculous that looked and at how it just defies physics, but then again, the whole story defies physics.
Another scene to mention is when Taki slips in the ‘underworld shrine’ (or whatever you call it). I mean, hey, I guess anything works to get him to look at the paintings on the ceiling. Still, I laughed a little when it slowed down as he fell on his back.
-	Missing Scenes:
I noticed that the movie seemed to have completely skipped Taki’s first day of being in Mitsuha’s body, not counting the part where he groped her breasts (sigh). 
I have also read Kimi no Na wa’s light novel, Earthbound, where it explains Mitsuha’s father better. I wished they could’ve added his story in; it would make complete sense to why he finally listened to his daughter and evacuated the town.

  About the story, was amazing how Makoto Shinkai plugged us into a mistery and the drama of if the main characters will ever meet each other.
 The arts was a masterpiece, there were times in the movie that i nearly cried just for observing the details, like when the comet was flying over the village.
 But what i enjoyed the most was the soundtrack, the RADWIMPS song Sparkle is now one of my favorites in animes songs, and along the movie there were a
                  lot of other beautiful songs.

I plan on making this review short because there is not much to say so here goes:
This anime is a masterpiece in my opinion and that you should definitely watch it!
I like to start with the cons and then we will move to the pros of this anime film.
Cons:
 - The sounds that were use were not the absolute best. It was quite simple and just nice. It fits the anime well but it still goes as a con I guess since I have heard better and it lowers the standart of the anime by a bit. 
- The story may be a little
                  hard to follow at times with terminology that is difficult to understand even most things are explained you may find yourself a little lost at times.
- Kimi no na wa doesn't really roll in the tongue and isn't easy to say. XD
Pros:
- Very beautiful story with great execution and thought went into making the films plot and the ideas involved.
- As expected from Shinkai Makoto's films the art is gorgeous and it's a very appealing anime film to look at.
- Great voice acting from everyone in the film with no decrease in quality.
- Intersting and lovable characters are everywhere in this film.
- It's hilarious at times and most people will understand the jokes especially if I got (I'm quiet slow at understaning jokes).
- The story plays with you and makes you a part of an advanture as you breathlessly watch the film rooting for the characters smiling with them and crying with them making this film a reality for the viewers.
As a conclusion I thing that Makoto outdid himself and made a content made to entertain gods and royalty and by pure chance it came down to this world for us all to enjoy.
This film got 10/10 for me and I cannot wait to get the blueray version to support the creators for making this masterpiece of a film.

Story - I really enjoyed the plot and how it all unfolded. Lots of surprises and twists I did not see coming. I felt it contained a great balance of comedy, suspense, and romance at just the right level for a movie. I felt emotions of happiness, wonder, awe, sadness, hope, and confusion and treasured every minute of it.Art - So much detail whether is be the smoothness of the animation or the still images it is probably the most visually stimulating anime ive ever seen.
Sound - A beautiful score i loved the piano and the placement and timing of the music was perfect. Sound effects also really good. My only negative thing i would say is not the biggest fan of the singers voice.
Characters - I think when it comes to a movie there is only so much to do to introduce all the characters then build upon them. You don't have any more further episodes or seasons its just one film. And yet the movie made me attached to the main characters and their desires just as good if not better than many episodic anime out there. While it would be nice to get to know more of characters backstories or some of the friends personalities more I like to think this movie was designed to let you just fill it in yourself about what type of lives they lived and focus more on the 2 main characters and I'm glad it went that way. 
Enjoyment - Simply a blast from start to finish. Great variety of intense emotional feelings and simple daily life scenes. Not many experiances given to me quite like this movie gave.
Overall - A must watch anime that's great to just take it all in. It helped me recover some of my imagination and desire to love someone again.",10,Skittles2519

                Kimi no Na wa, another one of Makoto Shinkai's outstanding and beautiful works. 
Story: 8
I have to admit this though the plot at the start was kinda weird. It went 0 - 100 really quickly in a messy way halfway through the movie. From like a slice of life comedy style anime to a very dramatic. I can't say it's bad nor good. But other than that the story was pretty nice and has captivated me in a way to just keep watching.
Art: 10
Kimi no Na wa is no exception to the beautiful art of Makoto Shinkai's films. Stunning and beautiful, the camera angles and
                  colours all mix very well together. The scenes are perfect, the background and wide-scale landscapes were also perfect. If you really love artistic style in anime this anime is definitely a must watch.
Sound: 10
The sound in this anime were amazing, soundtrack and songs were played at the right moment every time. They were well-planned and the songs were well written to fit what is happening in a scene. The voice acting for characters were also perfect. They really emphasise their feelings when they talk.
Character: 7
Now here's where Kimi no Na wa has it's downsides. The characters were kinda underdeveloped. There were some unmemorable supporting characters and the main character's relationships seems underdeveloped. Even so, I like the main character's personalities as they do make sense and are likeable.
Enjoyment: 9
I enjoyed almost every part of the anime. All these together creates a very fun ride that starts off kinda slow but at the end, it was well worth it.
Overall: 10
Kimi no Na wa has became one of my favourite animes. I've planned to re-watch this at a later date. But overall, a great story, perfect art and sound, ok good characters and a fulfilling enjoyment. I recommend this to anyone but if it's your first time watching anime, come back at a later date and watch this masterpiece. You will not be disappointed.

32281,"
                Kimi no Na wa is a work of art. I was refreshed at the end of it after having my heart torn apart and mended repeatedly in the latter half of the film. I dislike expressing my opinion of anime - or entertainment in general - with numbers, so I'll need a few paragraphs, but I'll try to keep this short and free of excessive hype or spoilers.
The concept of this anime got me as soon as I read the synopsis. I'm all over romance combined with weird supernatural stuff like this - hell, Kokoro Connect is one of my favorite anime. Unfortunately, though, I
                  didn't get around to watching this film until now, as I've been on a break from anime recently. I started watching the film expecting great visuals since it's a Makoto Shinkai film, but I wasn't as impressed by them as I with 5 Centimeters Per Second's. The comet looks absolutely incredible, and so too do the mountains, but perhaps I was too invested in the story and characters - I just wanted the plot to continue.
Despite the anime's high rating and my own enjoyment of it, I can certainly see why someone would dislike this film. It relies much on humor to keep viewers entertained while the characters are still being fleshed out in the former half of the film, and humor is, of course, highly subjective. If you don't get a chuckle out of the first few jokes, it could be hard to get to the film's strongest elements - the emotional scenes.
Emotional scenes are the meat of the pie - beneath them lies the crust that is viewer attachment. If you can't get a viewer invested in the characters, good luck trying to make emotional scenes. It's possible, especially when viewers can relate to a character's emotions or situation despite not knowing much about them, but even then it's difficult. Kimi no Na wa establishes its characters well. As a film, it has far less time than a TV series to flesh out its characters, but Makoto Shinkai films usually end up giving me a stronger bond with characters than most 12-episode anime do.
This movie is great. I'd recommend it to anyone that's ever seen and enjoyed an anime before - maybe even to those that haven't, actually. It was one of the better decisions in my life to see this film.",10,findwrite

The first time I watched this movie was enchanting. It had amazing music, beautiful artwork, and in my opinion an amazing story. Every scene that Taki Tachibana and Mitsuha Miyamizu swapped felt exciting and interesting. I feel like the plot can be confusing for someone who might not really focus on the plot and what is happening in the film, but it is relatively easy to understand, at least me. They made it so every little detail was a big deal in this film. They made things like ""katawaredoki"" and ""Musubi"" seem magical in their own ways. The ending
                  is the most enchanting. It can easily move you to tears if you are caught off guard, it's an incredibly creative story from Makoto Shinkai and I look forward to all of his future movies with great anticipation.",10,Showgate

                Time, time is something that is always out of your control. The fate of someone's life is never in your hands, its impossible to go against time. Messing with time deals significant consequence. Kimi no na wa is a heart warming phenomena of a story which is excellently told and executed.  
The story revolves around the aspect of time and space as a form of connection between two individuals, and shows no matter how much distance, how many obstacles or challengers one may face, they will always reunite. The destination of time will always be the same no matter how much its altered. Strands
                  of string may over lap and weave over each other however they end at the same place. The symbolism in this film with trains breaking off lines, the red line to show significance of time and the constant use of infinity symbols and dates is by far one of the best I've seen in anime.
This is probably one of the BEST anime movies ever made, for those who say it isnt are just hating. I speak for a lot of people when I say this, I cried throughout majority of this film.",10,kickback60

                This anime is honestly the best one yet. Although I did got a bit confused at the beginning, but it was all part of the movie. The life of them two connecting through a whole supernatural difference of life is truly remarkable. Such a very emotional anime movie I have ever watched! I would surely recommend this anime movie to everyone! A kind of animation that real life shows/movies cannot replicate or even beat it. The art is truly beautiful! The character development of both main characters shows true power of love and commitment. The kind of love that everyone fantasises about. I will surely
                  watch this again in the near future! It brought me into tears, and understanding of both characters and the story. Everything was clear to understand. The music that plays within more climactic scenes truly captivates the emotions that are intentionally brought within those scenes. Truly remarkable, and I am not surprised how this anime movie alone has made over $100 million at the Japanese Box Office since its release at the end of August in Japan!",10,markanthonyaf

                I just loved this story. At its core it is a love story between a boy and a girl who are separated by time and distance.  The movie explores a lot of metaphysical phenomena, and belongs just as much in the realm of ""many-universes"" time travel Sci Fi (the anime Noein is another).
There is a lot of mystery and unusual occurrences that are woven throughout the story.  It is fast paced in places and you have to pay attention to not miss plot points.  Still, you will enjoy discovering the plot reveals as the story moves forward.  The art and voice
                  acting are absolutely phenomenal (sub version at least) and the story is full of depth and emotion.  I don't want to say too much more because that would spoil it.  But it is an absolute must-watch on my list. 10/10.",10,bearvarine

This story does everything perfectly and allows the viewer to truly dive deep into the Japanese myths of time and connection. The way the movie played out the connection between two timelines that never should have been was perfect. Every little hint allowing for each other to meet was very detailed and made the story even better. This movie perfectly represents the flow of time and connections that can tangle, sometimes unravel, break, and then connect again. Representing human's bond to one another and.
The artwork in this movie just made everything better. The shots from every scene could've been
                  used as wallpapers and were detailed to the maximum. Nothing was wrong with any of it and showed truly how perfect this movie is.
Sound is an important part of one's viewing experience and can make it emotional. The sound absolutely got me and I fell in love with the music in this movie. The sound in this movie made emotional times even more. For example [SPOILERS] the running scene of Mitsuha trying to convince her father to evacuate the citizens had outstanding music that made it all the sadder and calming. 
Characters are amazing and loveable. Characters don't have to be too in-depth just to be good. These characters show amazing personalities and love for each other that just warm my heart. 
No matter how many times I watch this movie I will always fail to not shed a tear. My enjoyment is always the same. I will always feel the emotion and love in my heart and somehow it never dies down no matter how many times I repeat watching this movie.
Overall this is a perfection of a movie and if one truly understands it they can begin to understand the depth and masterpiece that was produced by Shinkai, the movie producer. Everything about this was amazing and I hope you can feel the same watching this.",10,Pee_Bee

                for me personally it moved me like nothing else before... not because it was a roller coaster of uncertainty and romance
but because it was a piece of art on many levels that managed to reflect the essence of the positive parts of the human experience for me ... reminding me of my errors and bad habits which i forget while also reminding me of the beauty of life regardless of how strange a time i'm going through
...and the movie did that through showing the aspects of: perspective in regards to human concepts like beauty and other things, through showing polarity and duality, showing that memories

...through doing all that naturally and seamlessly while capturing my attention and entertaining me with an interesting story

                One word: wow. Hands-down the best anime piece of media I have ever seen. Absolutely beautiful. Weak points are slightly confusing story and lack of character backstory, but is visually the most stunning animated production I’ve ever laid eyes on, and the soundtrack is also amazing (Zen Zen Zense in particular is a masterpiece of a track; definitely a top anime movie song). Beautiful story and inspires so much wonder that I cried the only time I watched it (so far). I have gotten nostalgic even though my first watch was less than a year ago. An absolute MUST-WATCH. Would recommend even to non-anime fans.

Someone who says they don't like Japanese Culture or under appreciate anime really need to watch this movie first before deciding something like that. The animation is one of the best animations I have ever seen in my life, the music is so good it makes you cry. The producers of this movies synced the music with the actual animation so well I wonder how much time and effort it took. Certainly deserves to be in the Top 5 position in MAL (MyAnimeList) and personally
                  I think it should be in the number 1 position just because of the quality of content this anime can portray to someone. This movies is seriously what got me into anime and it was an outstanding piece that definitely deserves all the 10's I have given to each aspect of the anime.

Kimi no na wa (Your name) was outstanding. I enjoyed every minute of it. I know the rating 10 means that the show was perfect and nothing was wrong with it, and I will stand by that forever. I genuinely feel that Kimi no na wa was a master piece. It is going to be hard to top in the coming years of anime. 
The director, Makoto Shinkai stated he didn't want people to actually watch his movie because he was afraid of being compared to Hayao Miyazaki. The difference between these directors
                  is so extraordinarily expansive that you cant compare them. Studio Ghibli and CoMix Wave films create different types of masterpieces and I want all of you to know that.
The Story | 10
Your name has an incredibly extensive story. The characters alignment with each other and the scene and setting of the movie cant be compared to anything done before. Of course its inspired from several different studios and stories, but coMix wave created something so incredibly unique with the way you connect to the characters and follow them on their journey in such a short amount of time. They do a great job with creating speculations with the plot, yet surprised me in the simplest way. 
Artwork | 10
I was personally stunned while watching this film in particular. I fell in love with Mitsuha the moment she appeared on screen. The animation was eye opening. It personally felt real when I was watching. The hair animations alone would make me rate this sub topic really high. The opening shot through the clouds was absolutely gorgeous as well. 
Sound/Music | 10
Please tell me if you didn't hum along to the opening song, honestly I would love to meet someone who didn't find that opening catchy. Radwimps obviously wouldn't be a band I listen to on the reg, but The two songs that played in the film by them were utterly amazing. I listened to them on repeat when I first watched Your Name. Watching the movie in theaters the second time really made me realize how much I loved the music and soundtrack in general.
Characters | 10
I can't get enough of the two main characters Taki and Mitsuha They are the epidemic of love. Searching far and wide for something he didn't even know was there. The theme of ""Hidden love"" is portrayed in such a way that we see everything in reality as its happening to them. I know that sounds kind of weird so let me explain
The first character we get to explore is Mitsuha. Clearly right off the bat, we get to see her life and how she is adapted to it. And Taki is revealed in the same scenario as mitsua, obviously not as himself, yet the whole time we are going back and fourth between their realities. Since the ""Op"" is going back and fourth i guess we don't get a great grasp of their characters until they meet. I don't see a problem with that, we clearly knew where things were going with them. All I know for sure is I fell in love with the characters and would actually love to see a special or side story on them again.
The other characters in the show like Tessie and Sayaka who show compassionate friendship throughout the Mitsuha arc. Okudera who breaks the seal of relationships between Taki and Mitsuha. And One of my favorite characters, Mitsuhas Sister. for some reason i really liked how she was quirky when Taki as Mitsuha would grab her breasts. And to see what her character becomes through the movie is moving for me. Im not sure why i like her so much.
Final Score | 10
Kimi No Na Wa is a movie that I believe everyone should see, its a show that has the chance to break the barrier between western movies and Japanese animation. This movie has such an amazing story that Western movie creators just cant replicate. And they shouldn't try either. I am very excited to see where Your name goes from here. I hope people will come to understand that anime isn't just girls flashing their breasts and being all cute. There are actual stories and relationships that build character.",10,Destronics

                *Spoiler free & straight to the point*
I saw this movie around the time it was hyped up and as expected I had some sort of expectations. This review is like 1.5 years late but it started to bother me that people slap this anime with a 10/10. Granted everyone is entitled to their opinion as am I, so let's get started.
Story: 7/10
While incredibly ambiguous and confusing at moments, I was intrigued. It was something sort of refreshing and different then most concepts in anime. Unfortunately I felt like there was something lacking. It felt incomplete. It felt rushed in parts and undeveloped in others. I
                  was disappointed to say the least. This is #2 on MAL and I don't really understand why. The story could have been amazing if this wasn't a movie. If this had been a series the story could have been more fleshed out and maybe even possibly groundbreaking. 
Art: 10/10 
I lied, I know why this anime is #2. It's because of the art and animation. I do agree that it's beautiful to look at. However, just because it's pretty doesn't mean we should ignore the flaws in the movie. It's like saying this man is so handsome and charming, but his personality is repulsive. You can't acknowledge the good without the bad.
Sound: 8/10
Much like the animation, the music is another reason why people flock to this immediately. My previous point I just mentioned is relevant to this as well. 
Character: 7/10
They weren't used to their fullest potential. There was so much more I wanted to know about them and I wanted more progression. I wanted to love them like everyone else did, but I couldn't. The two main protagonists just don't do it for me. I didn't dislike them or anything, but I wasn't in love with them either. And as the story came to a close I just left feeling ""is that it?"" And you should never have a movie or series have you say that. 
Enjoyment & Overall: 8/10
While I did enjoy the movie on an overall scale, I find it extremely difficult to call it a ""masterpiece."" I wasn't emotionally engrossed and the story & characters didn't impress me enough. My main point is that this movie should have been a series.",8,AnimeZ0id
32281,"
                I absolutely love the story. The story is not cliche despite the beginning few scenes make you wonder is it a generic body switching ecchi stuff. No, it certainly has amazing story. It is not predictable, it is not too complex, it is not very straight forward either. It is just...so real, so warm, so memorable.
The art is amazing, the overall atmosphere is touching and real. I have been to Japan. The details of the anime is so well done that left me wonder whether I really have been to those places. The illustration of their everyday lives look and feel so real and the
                  road, the apartment, the school, all look so real.
The characters are likable and cute. The MC is like everyday student but the way he reacted after the sense of loss, the effort he put into chasing after the dream simply touched me. MFC is cute, I do not mean the attractive looks she has (in fact she IS cute), just that she has cute personality.
I ended up in tears several moments in the movie. I'm genuinely touched, I haven't been so emotional for a very long time. This piece of art certainly deserves my 10/10.
I really enjoyed this. I would definitely recommend to all my anime friends who wouldn't mind to ride the emo train.",10,tanxinrong

                I've been wanting to watch this movie since it came out due to his hype, and after finalizing it, I realized it didn't have a great character development I thought it was going to have because of his popularity. The art and the sound/music is outstanding, it really gave the movie a beautiful tone. All the voice actors did a really good job and fitted well in their characters. 
The concept of the movie is remarkably sweet, and the plot is interesting. It surely isn't a bad movie whatsoever, but I honestly was expecting a little more. Even tho, I did enjoyed the movie, but
                  it's clearly overrated and not a masterpiece.",7,josejota

                In my opinion, this is a very heartwarming coming of age story that I enjoyed to the fullest. The first time I watched Kimi no Na Wa (Your Name) I was absolutely baffled at the story, while also confused. The story itself is absolutely heartwarming and really touches the soul of people. The first time I watched this though, I didn't feel that I felt odd because the characters seemed to have forgotten about each other and moved on with there lives. Only after watching this a second time did I realize that this is what was supposed to happen, (or not!). No matter how
                  you look at it, Your Name is a work of art everyone should watch, regardless of age.

                This movie is just okay. It's kind of sad that Japanese animation peaked back in the K-ON!! movie by KyoAni in 2009, and now with Kimi no Na wa (aka Your Name in USA) we get Japan telling us the exact same story and exact same animation and exact same characters and exact same scenes as 5 Centimeters Per Second, which literally came out 15 years ago, without any kind of plot twists. Or Plot turns, in my humble opinion. 
I defy you tell me the tone and ending of this movie's and 5 Cm/s was any different! Judging by this movie, Japan still is
                  a country of adults stuck in arrested development with no future and pathetic social skills just waiting for the world to end. SAD! (And perhaps BAD?)",5,Rormi
32281,"
                I found Your Name quite emotional and heart-warming. I loved its main protagonists (Taki and Mitsuha) and their complicated relationship, the amazing visual art which included some gorgeous Japanese landscapes ranging from both the countryside to the Tokyo metropolitan area (like Shinjuku), as well as its unforgettable soundtrack by Radwimps. 
The story presented a continuous twist of events with the inclusion of some nice fantasy elements which really captured my attention until the very end. I understand anyway those finding a lack of consistency in the plot, although I still appreciated its deep emotional side. 
Compared to previous Makoto Shinkai works like 5 Centimeters per
                  Second, I found it more fast paced and complex in its plot. All in all, I loved Your Name and I easily recommend it. Thanks for reading me!",10,Mur-CuoreDiVirgo
32281,"
                Dunno if people think the review is worth more because of it but I watched the movie knowing absolutely nothing about how highly regarded it was. Only thing I knew was that a friend of mine said that this and Koe no Katachi was good, and I actually postponed it because I didn't truly feel like watching it. So I didn't just ""follow the hype train"". That's not to say however that I simply thought it was good because I had low expectations. After the first minute of the movie my expectations were suddenly sky high, and they were surpassed after that. And even after
                  re watching it several times and about a year later my original opinion still stands.
Story - 9/10
Great story honestly, it doesn't dwell where it doesn't need too and is never too convoluted to follow while still not entirely predictable and never pulling plot elements out of it's own ass. Some people talk about the story not being that good or revolutionary, but honestly I think it's great. Not all stories need to be groundbreaking, they just need to be good, and it really is.
Art - 10/10
Anyone who dares to say that this movie isn't a master piece at least visually deserves to be sent to the gallows. I can only think of about 5 seconds of 'bad' animation in the entire movie, and by 'bad' I mean it's about as well animated as MHA. Which should give you a pretty good idea of the standard of the rest of the movie.
Sound - 10/10
Could I give the sound above 10/10 I would. It's great, I love it. Words cannot express it.
Characters - 7/10
The 'blandest' thing about the movie are the characters, but they are not bad by any means. Some people complain that the guy, Taki, is bland, one dimensional and lack any sort of character whatsoever. I'd say it's incorrect, however since most of his character is given by how people react to him not acting as himself rather than the movie actually showing him being himself, I can sort of understand why people complain.
Enjoyment - 10/10
10/10 would watch again
Overall - 10/10
Rather than trying to put into words my love for this movie, I'll express it through the good ol' talk about money: I had seen at least 20 animes before watching this movie, many of which I found to be amazing. I paid for none of them, not a single one, I watched them all illegally (well ~5 of them where on crunchyroll with ad block, is that legal? Who knows). But this movie made me spend money on anime for the first time, and not on impulse, I waited about a week until I bought it when I simply couldn't bear the thought of not owning this movie and searched up the web and to my surprise found it for sale (which I didn't expect, and is the reason I didn't just impulse buy it before).",10,hman1313

This is a spoiler free review.
I like Kimi no Na wa, more than I thought I would be. Honestly, I'm not a fan of Shikai Makoto. I don't like romance stories or stories which have romance as their main element. Still, I found Kimi no Na wa enjoyable. The art is stunning as expected
                  from Shikai Makoto's work. The music is absolutely great. Story can somehow hook you up as you cheer for, pray for the MC in some occasions. It also gave out a good message, a good picture about natural disaster, which can be related to many.
But, I still gave it a score 7, why?
Story is not Kimi no Na wa's strong point, in my opinion. I sometimes did hook up to the story flow, but that's it. I had no impression on story over all, I began to forget the movie as soon as leaving the cinema. The movie doesn't give me some urge to go online and send more information or fan arts related to it. The story's not bad, don't take me wrong. It just didn't leave any big trace on me after all.

                I think at the beginning I felt that things were too rushed and it would have benefited from an episodic release rather than a feature length. I disagree with that now, it was so important to hold onto those emotions as they intensified throughout the film. Nothing entered my mind as it went on.
It forces you to experience human emotions. Which is a bullshit thing I rarely put up with. However in this case that paid off, and I respect them for putting me through it. Funny, cute and intense. EMOTIONAL. CRYING AND SIGHING. Its competency had me believing they doesn't afraid of anything and

I write this knowing I'm 4 years late but God knows it had to be said, moreso because it's an unpopular opinion. Your no name is one of the most disappointing things I've ever laid my eyes on and hands down the most disappointing anime I've ever laid my eyes on( and yes I've watched oreimo, Tokyo ghoul root, neon genesis evangelionetc)
Considering how much hype it has gotten I was expecting a masterpiece rivaling Miyazaki's greatest works, or even more recently and released the same year, something like a silent voice. Imagine my surprise when halfway into the movie, I realise that the film
                  is nothing more than a Ferrari with the engine of a farm tractor. Heck even Makoto himself doesn't think his work is that good.
Before I watch anything audiovisual, I always make a point to look at its ratings on sites harbouring critics who I believe objectively watch the particular show in question.
As I watch anything audiovisual like movies, anime, series etc I consciously make a wish that the rating I saw is truly reflected or at the very least close to what I lay before my eyes, largely because I hate wasting my time on dismal quality shows.
When I began watching your name, myself like many others were entranced by the vibrant backgrounds, the fluid animation of even the most unimportant things like birds flying, water surfaces etc. But I've watched enough anime to know that breathtaking art and animation does not a masterpiece make in the anime medium. The first few minutes were really good but with Mitsuha and Taki coming to terms of the body swapping arrangement, and I thought that the film would build up on that to a fulfilling peak and maintain the tempo until it culminates in a crescendo of genius writing such that anyone who would have keenly followed the happenings minute by minute would have absolutely no doubt that what they watched was a masterpiece. Instead why we got was poor character development (at least we know a little about Mitsuha, but what about Taki,what makes Taki tick lol), poor plot delivery (what the hell is musubi? How could the characters not tell they were in different years despite going to school daily). All this was sacrificed for what felt like a forced love story living me with a lack of emotional connection with the characters and even less emotionally invested in their ""fated love story"". I understand that not everyone is this cynical while watching something meant for enjoyment and which is why I believe many loved the idea of it. Yes, it is my strong belief that many viewers who watched the film, wanted it to be something more and meaningful, but were hoodwinked by the animation, music placement and the unnecessary melodrama meant to Tug at viewers heartstrings, such that by the end of the film in spite of it being an incoherent unrelatable mess, all they could remember is boy and girl swap body, boy and girl start liking each other(for no reason) it stops suddenly because girl dies and it all becomes a giant tribulation to reunite across space and time in their love. Very easy to chew and swallow nonsense. 
Anyway this is my first major review of any anime mainly to get the frustration out from my chest since I was extremely unsatisfied at the end of it all. Still I had no doubt that the film was worth a 7, but settled on a 6 as a fine for my time which I will never get back smh!",6,CecilShakurin

                Kimi no Na wa  (Your Name) is a superb film. It takes a premise almost exhausted in its use by other examples of pop culture and gives it a little extra twist to keep it fresh, as well as using the original idea to its fullest possible extent. 
The art is breathtaking, the soundtrack is fantastic and you'll love every character in this film for various reasons without a doubt. The themes on this story centre around family, love and loss but isn't afraid to pepper certain scenes with humour where perhaps it could be considered tasteless if done wrong. This movie experience will
                  be sure to make you laugh and it may even make you cry.
The success of Your Name in the West represents how fabulous storytelling is a universal language in all ethnic corners of the globe. This film is essentially timeless, if you were to watch it in 5 or even 10 years time there would no doubt be similarities within society and the issues that the two main characters face and have to overcome in their awkward teenage years.
With the release of Your Name, a classic was born and shall live in the hearts of anime fans (and at the very least mine) forever.",10,mrweast
32281,"
                To say that “Your Name” is visually striking would be a giant understatement. Shinkai and his team have both an eye for detail and a poetic vision. The settings of “Your Name” somehow feel both lived-in and magical at the same time. Whether it’s the train system in Tokyo, its gorgeous skyscrapers touching the sky, a never-ending horizon in Itomori, or even just a series of streets on a mountainside, “Your Name” is one of those animated films in which one could pick any still frame from it and hang it on their wall. Despite the gorgeous visuals, the story falls flat on its face.
                  The story continues to stumble over and over due to the lack of any explanation and character development. There was never a point in time while watching this movie where I wasn't confused. Your Name just throws out ideas and just rolls with them without much thought put into it and no matter how much you think about it it will never make sense. One example of this is when the two main characters suddenly forget about the other's existence even though the cause of this has nothing to do with their memories. The romance is shoehorned in, even though neither of the characters have actually even met they fall in love over the fact they took over each other's body. I feel if this were a series rather than a movie they would to flesh out and explain a lot more. It is still a good movie, don't get me wrong, but the story feels rushed and imcomplete.",8,TheFlashmaster

                Alrighty so this is my first review and I can't write it on anything other than Kimi no na wa (Your Name). I just wanna start off by saying that this is not only the best anime I've watched but the best fictional piece of anything I've seen ever. This was the movie that got me into anime in the spring of 2017 and I am sure glad I watched it. 
Story - 10
I think that even though there are very obvious similarities to shows such as Kokoro Connect and other time traveling/body swapping shows, this movie still delivers its very unique approach to this
                  concept of time traveling/body swapping. The story couldn't have ended better also and I think that it was just overall very solidly executed. 
Art - 10
Shinkai is known for his art and many think for his art alone. Every visual detail in this movie brings about a new dimension to the story as a whole and the overall effectiveness of the message conveyed to the audience in each scene. I don't want this to sound too much like an English paper but I have to give it to Shinkai for yet another masterpiece in terms of the art style used in this film. 
Sound - 10
The soundtrack was so great that I listened to it for two months straight every day on the way back from school. I cannot say enough good things about the OP/ED and the insert songs but also the OST was just so fitting with what I like to call a modern approach to traditional Japanese music. Everything about the soundtrack is top notch. 
Characters - 8
Nothing wrong with the characters, but they just aren't as interesting as I wish they could've been. 
Enjoyment - 10
I think you can tell at this point that every moment of this film was very enjoyable for me. It's so enjoyable to the point where I have watched it 12 times in total and shared it with like everyone I know weeb or not. A big part of the enjoyment in the second half is the suspense that the climax builds which is then resolved at the end makes it so heartwarming and satisfying. 
Overall - 10
Many people criticize this movie for things such as plot holes (which I found none), unoriginality, and just the fact that a story like this is not that relatable (which shounen shows obviously are lol). I really can't care to take any points off this film for reasons that have nothing to do with the actual quality of it and that is why I think Kimi no na wa is the best anime and movie ever created.",10,oBobma
32281,"
                Kimi no Na wa is a story of fate, destiny, and the influx of the past and present. And while it can be considered to fit into the genre of romance, or love, it is much more than this; instead, it blissfully incorporates various genres so that to squeeze the film into one or three would underestimate the power of Kimi no Na wa. 
The plot commences with an incredible shot of the sublime comet that is frequently revisited throughout the film (and in that sense, it serves as a symbol for many things.) Immediately we are drawn into the calm and peaceful life of
                  Mitsuha, only to be thrown into the hustle and bustle of Taki Tachabana's Tokyo-centered existence. It is the rush and thrill of this story that gives the film its beauty and magnificence; the film is more than a movie, as it beautifully captures a plethora of themes - ranging from love, loss, longing, and life - which ultimately leads me to conclude that Your Name transcends prerequisite expectations and stands as a philosophical outlook on existing. The story had me feeling a range of emotions, all spiralling from one end of the spectrum to another.
It would be foolish to compose a review of this film without mentioning the profound style of art. Some scenes are so captivating and eye-grasping that if, perchance, the story was utterly rubbish,  the idealism of the scenery and art as a whole would be enough to continue watching. It is also important to emphasize the colour scheme and the vibrant hues of dark and light colours that intertwine in an extraordinary way. In this sense, the art that is painted from this film is enough to possess the right of having its own documentary/stand-alone film. 
Although this film is dynamic and complex in the tale it tells, and the messages it conveys, there are slight faults that come along with it. Firstly, it is only to be expected that with a detailed and rich story that is Your Name, the prevalence of plot holes would be apparent. It is also worth mentioning that the reality of the time travel and exposition of cause and effect is questionable, and often left me pondering of the connection between two different stimuli that resulted in a beautiful outcome. 
It is this wonder and lust for more which Kimi no Na wa pulls from you that keeps you watching. Chances are that you are a fan of one of the many themes and matters the film explores, which should be enough to convince you to watch it. But if you are skeptical and need more convinving, then all I can say is this: turn it on, and let the first 20 mins transport you to another world.",8,vincent_0
32281,"
                ""Your Name."" is a great movie, but it isn't Shinkai's best. 
First off I didn't really like the characters and the plot. The plot makes sense, but it doesn't do enough to make me feel for the characters. The characters don't have a great chemistry with one another. Mitsuha and Taki both don't really grow to love each other. Although they learn about each other's lives, they never really build a romantic relationship.  Their love is ""instant"". Similar romantic films have this problem, the ""instant"" love dilema. It has trouble pacing through the romance aspect between its lead couple. The animation and music is
                  where the movie shows its true colors. Of all things, I had trouble finding the meaning, the lesson behind this movie. Of course it is about unity, but what am I supposed to do with that concept? Many viewers point out that this movie portrays concepts relating to gender. I can see that viewers get that sort of vibe from this movie. We live in a world where people fight over gender politics. But I don't think the movie's message was pertaining to gender politics at all! The bodyswaping aspect was just a plot device nothing more.
All in all, this movie is NOT A MASTERPIECE and ISN'T TERRIBLE either. At most this is an artistic, decent movie. And thus this movie receives a score of 9/10.",9,Mr_Arbitrary

                I don't think I have ever had a more stressful 2 hours. This movie will wrench you heart strings till they are about to break, then put them back together, only to wrench them to the breaking point again, only to mend them back, only to finally break them to the point where there is only a small bit of thread left, pulsing with a desperate, weak hope. Then, the movie will throw the ending at you, and everything will be right with the world.
If that sounds like it's all over the place with the emotion, then it is, but it works well for this
                  movie.
/BASICALLY A SYNOPSIS AHEAD/
The two main characters find that sometimes, they wake up, and they have switched bodies with each other. They eventually work out a way of keeping track of each other's doings will switched, and set some ground rules. Then, just as the main characters have fallen for each other, it stops. The switching never happens again, and they begin to have their memories be more blurry with each passing day.
Mitsuha decides to go to Tokyo, where Taki lives. She finds him, but finds that he doesn't know who she is. Unbeknownst to her, she has sought him out three years before he started to switch. Heartbroken, she returns to her town. Some time later, a comet splits, an her town is hit. She dies.
Three years later, Taki starts experiencing the switch. Eventually, however it stops, and when he tries to call her, her phone is dead. Some time later, he decides to seek her town out, so that they may meet. After a lot of searching, he eventually finds it. A crater, where she used to live. Heartbroken, he returns to his hotel. Then he remembers a sacred mountain, where the God that Mitsuha's shrine worshiped was.There, he met her again. He told her to write their names on each other, so that they wouldn't forget each other. He wrote 'I love you' on her palm, which she hadn't read yet, and as she was going to write her name, dusk ended, and they could no longer communicate.
However, she now knew that the town would be hit by a meteor, and so she was able to prevent it.
She forgot his name while trying to save the tow, but when she read her palm, she remembered, and so, she was able to save the people that would have dies, and in the end moved to Tokyo.
He, however, forgot.
Five years later, they keep seeking out something, though they don't know what it is. After empty lives of longing experienced for five years, they have their one true meeting after glimpsing each other on separate trains. They follow each other, searching all over, until finally, they meet each other. However, while she remembers, he does not.
Just when your heart gives out an dies, he hesitates, turns around, and asks ""Hey, haven't we met before?""
She tearfully replies""Yes, I thought so too!""
And just like that, your leaps with joy.
Obviously, this is only a synopsis, and while giving away the main line of the story, this movie is something you have to experience. Honestly, i don't understand how more people don't know this one. Please, watch it. You will experience heartache like you wouldn't believe, but at the end, you will be jumping in your seat with joy and satisfaction.",10,TheLordAbhorsen

                The story is a but rundown, it isn't the first of its kind plot wise, there have been a handful of other animes with similar themes but the execution was very crisp and well-done.
The art is very modern, but not edgy like most anime tries to be nowadays, with sharp angles and character design, making it look too futuristic, but rather a bit down to earth and plain, yet drawn with quality.
The music is very memorable, i've listened to the main theme atleast a dozen times, its just that catchy and fun.
Character development was neither deep nor shallow, everything had good pacing. I was actually
                  surprised how much they managed to squeeze into less than two hours worth.
Enjoyed the show a lot, everything just clicks and made it a great movie to watch.

                This movie was absolutely amazing and breath taking. After finishing the movie, I was left wordless and speechless. I've read many reviews (of course without the spoilers) about how amazing the anime was. Since it was ranked #1 on MAL, I thought the movie should've been great. But after watching it, I understood why the anime deserved its ranking. The director was absolutely a genius in conveying the characters' feelings and making the audience grow fond of them. Truly, he knew what he was doing. 
The soundtrack and music gracefully fit with the image of Kimi no Na wa. I mean, the story was already
                  great, but the music too? Like the greatest peanut butter and jelly sandwich in the world. Not to mention the art. I've seen many great anime shows with art that could blow one's mind, but Kimi no Na wa is another story. I've never seen scenery quite like this movie. When I saw it, my mind went blank. It was so beautiful, I thought it could even beat real life (which it probably did). 
I wish I could just turn back time and watch the movie for the first time again. This movie made me cry of sadness (because it was over and the music just hit me) and joy. The only thing missing from this work of art is a sequel or even a short. The reviews didn't influence my love for this anime. I didn't need it. The movie was perfect in doing its job itself, a truly magnificent job.",10,Fujimori_Akari

                WOW! 
I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review for Kimi No Nawa. This movie was WOW! I watched it about 4 months ago and it still affects me today.
As a person who was somewhat familiar with anime last year, Your Name was hyped like CRAZY. I didn't know anything about what made this anime so hyped but I'm thankful that I finally got to see it this year and boy is this anime a MASTERPIECE. Everything is so well made. This is my first time tearing up during a movie and also a first time when a movie made me
                  heart wrench everytime I thought about this movie.
I loved this movie and I think this movie is my favorite of all time so I might be biased but I'm biased for a reason so lets get on with the review!
Story 8/10:
The story idea I'll admit isn't original. It's about a boy and girl who end up switching bodies BUT the plot twist is what makes this story special. Who knew they had a 3 difference and who knew that they actually made an effort to see each other. This story is so beautifully done. At the beginning, you think ""Oh it's a body transfer romantic movie, I wonder how this is gonna pan out. Are they gonna try to meet each other?"" but as the story progresses you begin to realize ""Oh crap! They don't remember each other at all. Maybe this is where the problem is gonna happen."" BUT THEN THEY HIT YOU WITH THE FACT THAT SHE ALREADY HAD DIED BECAUSE OF THE COMET. LIKE HOLY CRAP, I'm pretty sure 99% of the audience did not expect that. So afterward it becomes all dramatic where Taki has to try to save Mitsuha and it so MASTERFULLY DONE. LIKE WOW. It's so easy to mess up in romantic scene because they can either be melodramatic such as ""I love you so much don't leave me"" but these love scenes can be best described as short and bitter. My heart hurts everytime I think about the time that they met each other at the crater and they don't talk about ""Oh I loved you for so long"" but instead they talk about simple casual things like ""You touched my boobs! You pervert"" but eventually leading into the main reason why they met each other which was to prevent the meteor. And then the most beautiful scene happens when they decide to write their names on each other's hands but right when Mitsuha decides to, they can no longer see each other. THIS SCENE GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS EVERYTIME. Now this scene is so beautifully done because it is not melodramatic and 2) what Taki writes on Mitsuha's hand is so beautiful. Instead of writing his name he writes ""I love you"" which I think is so smart of Taki because he knew it would be erased so might as well write a message that will last forever. Sorry about my spiel about that one scene but yeah the story is executed phenomenally. So yeah Your Name is THE BEST.
Art 10/10:
Wow Makoto Shinkai is amazing. The art in this movie is amazing. Honestly if the art wasn't that great I don't think I would've liked this movie as much. The art makes Kimi no Nawa special. Just the story + the art is what makes this movie so emotional and beautifully done. Everything is so detailed, everything is so perfect. It almost makes you feel like you're in the movie. The character design is awesome as well. I LOVEEE Mitsuha's character design. She is so pretty while having that determined look. By far Mitsuha is imo the prettiest anime girl I have seen. 
Sound 10/10:
SOUND IS AWESOME. The music within this movie is great. I love RADWIMPS and every one of their songs fits the atmosphere that Kimi No Nawa brings. It helps bring out that emotional/alluring vibe that Your Name gives to the audience. And the voice acting is brilliant as well. Mitsuha sounds like Mitsuha, and Taki sounds like Taki. Especially when they switch bodies you can EASILY tell if Mitsuha is Taki and vice versa because the subtle changes in their voices make it really clear who's in whose body.
Character 10/10:
I just loved the two MCs. They have such great chemistry and they both are really cool characters. They just feel real, with real human desires. 
Overall Kimi no Nawa is a masterpiece. I can see why this movie is so hyped. Everything from the cinematography, music, art is just so wonderfully integrated. I love Your Name and I promise you will too.",10,DrYumYum
32281,"
                Haha, yet another example of all beauty with no substance,
Your Name is quite a mess of a movie, random things unexplained, plot holes, stale characters, the list goes on. 
The best words to describe this movie is, anti-climatic. Every impactful moment involving Taki and Mitsuha feels like absolutely nothing to me because their situation involves 0 personal interaction causing me to be in disbelief on how they fell in love. I understand you care about him  but I just don't get why? This would have been easily done better if it was just a friendship instead of biting of more than you can chew
                  and making it a romance. But since it's a girl and a guy, you can't have that. The romance is just completely unbelievable to me. I'm not sure how anyone actually thinks 2 people can fall in love like that. They had 0 chemistry, the writers just sorta, shoved them together. It makes more sense for them to care about their friends and family more than each other because those are the people they actually interacted with. 
The characters are quite flat and so are their relationships, you don't get much of their outside relationships except for meaningless interactions between other characters. The only characters who didn't suffer from this issue were Mitsuha's friends and that one chic Taki has a crush on, but even her character was barely meaningful to the story or her relationship with Taki. Taki's dad was just forgotten about and so were Mitsuha's other friends. I'm not sure why they added all these characters to barely do anything with them. From Taki's side, it seems like they were going to do something with these side characters but nope. You could have left them as just a snapshot of Taki's relationships and outside life, no need for them to get so close to the plot. I could understand the abundance of out of place characters if they did something to develop the main characters but no, they just took a back seat and nothing else for most of the movie. 
Mitsuha's family were severely underused, and we don't get much of Mitsuha's relationship with her father so I don't care when she eventually stands up to him. Grandma and Sister are there...yeah. Mitsuha's friend were kinda cool tho, they actually did something and interacted with the main characters. 
There's just too many things this movie wanted to do involving relationships, Taki's relationship with the hot chick was just there I guess, his 2 friends were there I guess. Mitsuha's relationship with her grandma and sister were there and her relationship with her dad was there too, barely. At this point, just drop all these relationships since you want to focus on the main 2 characters so damn bad, you can't do both. 
Taki is just the boring default protagonist that every person that identifies as a man can relate to. It's getting old. This character is a virgin who can be slightly anxious sometimes but can also can solve everyone's problems because they're the heroin. Taki stays completely static through out the entire movie, no change, no character development. He's boring to say the least. Mitsuha is slightly better written, she's your basic cute timid girl than any boy could fall for. She has character development [if you squint really hard] involving her dad which was sadly, once again, barely touched on. 
There are a lot of plot holes and unexplained plot points throughout this movie. First of all, you're telling me Matsuhi, nor Taki were aware of the dates?? Like, did Matsuhi not check Taki's phone and saw a different date than she was aware of. Did Taki never write the date on his homework while in Matsuhi's body? What are these random amnesia moments they keep having. Hello? This just seems like they did it as a plot device to raise the stakes. How come Matsuhi drinking homegirl's spit gave him some visions? We're just gonna pass this off as magic spit necessary to get the plot going? yes? okay. How did they switch bodies while still awake. I thought they could only did it when they fell alseep, that's how the story set it up as. You have to have a set of rules involving magical supernatural situations like this, it keeps the story grounded. You can't have random sh1t just happen for no reason, this just makes it so that anything is possible, reducing the stakes.
The climax of the story was quite anti-climatic. They just sorta did a 360 and finally decided to reveal the obviously coming major plot point. I feel like they should have left clues showing the viewer something was off, building up to the reveal instead of just saying ""OMg she was dead from the start. wild! Isn't that CRAZYYYYYY"" like we're 5, There's a load of missed opportunities to improve the storytelling in general.
The animation was disappointing to say the least, yes it's pretty but the animation itself is boring. Take this for example, loads of recent disney movies have these gorgeous hyperrealistic backgrounds, but... it's boring. Now take Spiderman Into- the Spiderverse. The backgrounds are more inventive, different, interesting, creative. It just has more personality, it's own feel. Your Name just looks nice, that's it, ya know?  The way characters move are boring too, the only thing I'll praise it for is how they show Mitsuha's more feminine mannerism through Taki's body. I thought that was pretty cool. Everything else, meh. Oh and there's the red string, super deep right? Never seen that before.

                Your Name - a short, simple, and fun way to experience a roller coaster of emotions.
Compared to ""The Garden of Words"" and ""5 centimeters per second""--two popular movies that were also directed by Makoto Shinkai--""Your Name"" is somewhat less serious and a tad bit fun. Still, this doesn't mean that this has less drama, because for some, it would still bring in some tears. Although, generally speaking, the flow of the story tends to lead us toward the happy route.
Speaking of the story, I appreciated the way it was written. Seemingly confusing and extremely cheerful at first, so I can't believe what followed each chapter
                  of the movie. Like I said earlier, this film will make you feel all sorts of emotions; joy, sorrow, anxiety, uneasiness, excitement, fear, relief, disbelief, awe, and whatever you can think of. The transitions of the story from one point to the other were perfect. What I did not appreciate was how ""cliche"" the characters were, to a certain extent. I can't say that I disliked the character designs and personalities, but I did not dig into the idea that those characters were such persons that were so determined and engrossed in their feelings that they will go to such lengths just to enforce their actions. The jubilant and somewhat supportive tone was supposed to make me feel good about the story and the characters, not make me think how they could've done better with some scenes (not that I'm good at anything, but you can just guess how I feel). Either way, I liked the plot as a whole. I'm not a fan of the supernatural genre, but this one is pretty good.
The art and animation were just astounding even when watched in ""potato quality,"" as expected from a film by Makoto Shinkai. I can see people such as myself saving several panels to be used as wallpapers and things of the sort. The animation was flawless and I didn't notice anything unusual. If there were any, I was too busy paying attention to the 99% good part instead of the 1% bad part.
And finally, let's talk about the sound aspect of the film. The soundtracks used in the whole film were definitely appropriate. Each soundtrack per scene added more feeling to what was being shown, especially those moments when there were insert songs made by RADWIMPS. I never heard of the artists prior to viewing this movie, but I really liked those songs because they made the scenes more emotional. For other sound aspects such as voice acting and sound effects, I have nothing to mention.

                When I see this movie recieving 10/10 scores and knew this was a romance I prepared myself to tear this anime apart. It's not like I dislike romance (there is my pnctuation on Toradora!) but it would not be the first or the last time te critic praise too much intrascendent works, so I was ready to punish this movie for any little mistake... and I can't believe the reslt yet.
The things clear is not the masterpiece someones are preaching, It has mistakes like the style series openning and the mounting that supposed to be funny just beacause the characters talk fast is ridicoulus, but
                  these are just a little abrasion on what it is a Ferrari.
The best part of Kimi no na wa is how appeals to our felling of fantasy Cortázar tlaked about. It's this childish felling that makes us not to conform with the reality and pushes us to look for something else. Kimi no na wa is an example of the prodigious human imagination and that's something very hard to find today.
Now I'm supposed to talk about the plot but I'm not gonna do that because if you wanna watch Kimi no na wa don't get inform on Kimi no na wa and if don't wanna watch it... ha ha ha of course you wanna, DON'T GET INFORM ON KIMI NO NA WA! Because go to watch it with that ignorance is just let suprise yourself with this movie and make that felling of fantasy even stronger.
Others big achievments of this movie is the soundtrack and the animation. Let's start with the soundtrack. A good soundtrack it's not just big hits you put in your movie, must be songs that encapsulate every moment and Kimi no na wa's soundtrack flow for its veins. It is not a aparted element, the both are beatiful unite.
And the animation. Oh my God the animation! If this movie has not premiere in ypur city yet, wait for it, beacuse this is one of those works that not only worths it but must to be watch so qith the best posible picture and sound qualities.
There a pair of things about it I'm not pretty sure if I must point it as virtues. The first of them is the twists, there are just too much twists on this movie. But didn't make me feel confused thanks to its great managed rythm. Kimi no nawa knows very well when to be calm, when to be frenetic, when to rest and when to have to give that final sprint.
The other thing is the romance, again I like the romance but for this movie... I think they are just lookig for the big public with this beacuse the relationship is so personal and intimate that could something beyond the love, unique and platonic, but when thay say the word ""love"" I inmidately think in a couple. There are peaople over there complaining on the ambigous final but I think that's the grace about it and if they avoid the word ""love"" then would be open to a interpretation of something bigger, more magical, more mystical than love. But that's only fantasy, you get it?
Kimi no na wa is a little jewel I strongly recommend to watch, it's not perfect as I said has mistakes here and there, but it's simply a movie that stole a little part of my heart and may keep with you too.",8,MaxHeidegger

                Story 9 : 
It's not the most original type of story but it's still very well presented. It's very confusing at first but that makes the viewer think together with the characters about what's happening. In the end, most of the things become clearer and you start to understand the story.
Art 10 : 
The art style is very nice. Very colourful and cheerful sceneries are being depicted (most of the time) and the same goes for the characters. It's the regular art style for original animes but it's still very beautiful.
Sound 10 : 
The music producer did a great job. The music matched every moment
                  it depicted very well and gets you into the feels of the scene you're in. The songs are also very nice and catchy.
Character 9 : 
The two main characters are high school students and even though sometimes in the story you might question ""is this realistic for a high school student?"" it doesn't matter in the end because is characteristics match with the story that you don't care in the end. Both very nice personalities.
Enjoyement 10 : 
This movie has everything : humour, a bit drama, romance, some action here and there. Both boys and girls can enjoy this movie to its fullest.
Overall 10 :
I really enjoyed the movie! I got so much into it it was sad that the movie finished... there was no character that I could say ""i don't like you"". I really liked the art style, which in my opinion is always important. It matches just so well with the style of the movie and it's really nice/easy to watch (don't know if you see what I mean?).

Very remarkable story that kept me glued to the screen watching. It kept me enticed wondering what was going to happen next and how things would turn out. There were a few moments where I was confused and didn't understand what was going on.
The art and sound was very well, everything tied together and was crafted perfectly. It wasn't anything that stood out exceptionally, but it looked modern and clean, which is well expected.

Now that we have gotten that out of the way, I want to give my personal opinion on the film. I had the great fortune to see it 2 times at my local theatre. Now on with my review:
What is beauty? Is it the sound of the sea during a storm? Is it the sound of grasshoppers on a humid summer's day? Is it determined by any one single dominant element, or the fusion of several threads that come together, interconnecting, to form a myriad of colors in a tapestry?
What is a masterpiece? Is it a magnum opus? Is it something that fills us with pathos, until we are at the brink of tears, be they of joy or of sadness? 
But more importantly, I ask you, reading this, how do you decide what constitutes a masterpiece and what doesn't?
Makoto Shinkai's latest work, Kimi No Na Wa, is all that and more. Setting the bar very high for following works, it sits comfortably among the greats in animation, if not filmmaking in general. Makoto Shinkai has earned his place among the great directors of our time, and western animation could learn alot about storytelling by example.
I recently went to see this expecting to see your average slice of life/romance anime, and had my doubts, figuring it would have had all the usual clichès, boy meets girl, falls in love, etc etc atleast, that is what the trailers would lead you to believe. But this film is anything but average, moreso I wouldn't even call it a film, but an almost two hour experience. A delight for all the senses it satifies from the beginning to the end and it has a completeness to it that few other films may boast, not only among anime but among films in general.
That being said, this film is not perfect. In fact it very well may have several imperfections, mainly characters and storytelling (though it was a completely new topos for me); imperfections which  more likely than not have been discussed at length by other people. All I can suggest to the reader, is to see it and decide for themselves. Anything else would do you, the reader, and the film quite an injustice.
Art, being human, is, by definition, imperfect in itself. But does that make the emotions that it evokes in us any more or less valid? A painting may have corrections, and a book may have errors. Are those works of art any more or less masterpieces just because they aren't perfect?
 The truth is, nothing is perfect, nor will it ever be, not while created by imperfect beings. But why does that matter? 
Why strive for objective perfection, when we perceive imperfect things to be perfect?
It isn't a perfect film, but it is, possibly more importantly, a perfect experience.
What really else matters?",10,Morgormir

                There are two types of people who enjoy this movie, one is hyped by their friends or the internet and decide to see.  Because if you say something bad about this movie, you literally get bashed by salty fanboys/girls.
The second one are people who under age the of twenty and are easily manipulated in their emotions, with other words they think anime like clannad are the greatest of all time.
The concept is this movie is ripped-off from the visual novel remember 11 (author of ever17,999,ZTD).
The romance is rushed, there is literally so few interactions between them that are only showed in the flashback sequence
                  etc. The other characters are just fillers in this movie, weak developed and unnecessary.

                Your Name / Kimi no Na wa is my favorite anime movie.
In fact, it was also the first anime movie I saw, but I do not think it's appropriate for an anime, because it's a complex and deep movie as well.
Earlier I said that Kimi at Na Wa is my favorite movie and now I'll explain why it is. Add two of my favorite topics: ""drama"" and still ""romance"" and also because it's an exciting movie.
To conclude, the desires of the main characters (Mitsuha and Taki) are realized, so I think this movie can also show us a bit of the ""slice of life"" an
                  interesting topic to add to this story.

                The sun sets and rises upon a valley of lush greenery; a lake exalting the already resplendent scenery of an ocean of stars. Set in a rural locale, a train's ride away from Tokyo, the view itself leaves you serene.
""Kimi No Na Wa"" is the pinnacle of a masterpiece. The delivery of the show is so masterful, it holds you awe-inspired. The story is brilliantly, elegantly, and painstakingly crafted, although quite simple and linear in composition, it is a tale that is both welcoming and heartwarming.
The movie's art and animation are simply outstanding. As someone who loves both conventional or traditional works of art and
                  photography, I must say, the staff really did their homework on this spectacle of a show. It is truly a sight to behold. Next, we have the sounds and music of the movie. I am utterly in love with the way the sounds and music were put in transition. The popular Japanese rock band, Radwimps, who was responsible for the soundtrack, was the perfect fit for the movie given its category. I'm a person who loves to listen to a good band, and the way Radwimps composed their songs for the movie is just splendid (the lyrics just tore my heart apart). The songs were basically one of the reasons I bawled my eyes out while watching in the cinemas (lol).
The characters are not overrated. They're simply two kind and innocent beings living a life when a sudden incident occurred that changed their lives forever. Saying that the characters are just ""likable"" would be a mistake in one's own right; ""lovable"" would not utterly be an understatement.
To sum it all up, I'll just have to say that Kimi No Na Wa is one of those unique and beautiful works of art that is totally worth your time. It hasn't been the top-ranked anime of the year for no reason.

                God damn....that was actually pretty good.
Do you know the idiom of ""put oneself in someone's shoes"", well Kimi no Na wa takes this to the literal example of it and considering you read the premise of this anime movie, you'd think that this movie is just about a ""Freaky Friday-flip"" kind of movie right?. Well Kimi no Na wa doesn't have Drama and Romance under it's genres for nothing.
Ok, let's start with the characters, early on the two main protagonist Mitsuha Miyamizu voiced by Mone Kamishiraishi, a country girl with some private family issues who wants to go to Tokyo to get away from the
                  boredom of the country and Taki Tachibana voiced by Ryunosuke Kamiki a hard working, no-nonsense city boy are the two who  ""Freaky Friday-flips"" and from that even though they body switches, we do get to see their personalities and develop each other through the others and their own actions which actually comes in to great comedic effect, something LA wasn't expecting and yes there's a weird running gag in the movie with touching boobs which LA thought was overused but actually handled the comedic side quite well, the actual ""fantasy aspect"" of the freaky Friday flipping is actually used to great effect giving us the proper development from each of these two characters in each others bodies as well as themselves in their own bodies and using the repetitive nature of ""how life is like"" and squarely using the body switching to make the comedic skits to good effect, it also improves Mitsuha and Taki as a  relationship, as they grow even though they are so very far apart. The both of them further develops once the movie delves into the mystery and drama of their body switching which goes into the more romantic side of things and LA might as well say it but utilizing the supernatural aspects ALSO helped make the romance naturally greater than before to the point LA ""cried"" a bit when the two FINALLY met. Point being Mitsuha and Taki are the two ""biggest contributors"" to this movie from a romantic, dramatic, mystery and supernatural element as well as giving us the core theme of connection of the two characters like the Musubi (obi sash)/comet and the Kuchikamisake later being a symbolism of Mitsuha and Taki's relationship.
*ahem* ok, other characters, the minor characters are used to their full effect as being supporting characters and they do ""help"" and contribute to the plot when they are needed (this especially on Mitsuha's minor characters). Also very clever Makoto Shinkai for subtlety adding in Yukari Yukino from Kotonoha no Niwa.....hi Kana Hanazawa!. Really LA isn't saying much about the minor characters as it really isn't their story, it's Mitsuha's and Taki's. 
Now LA talked about how the fantasy aspect of body switching was used to GREAT effect, but what about the drama and ""mystery""?. Well due to the utilization of body switching element it was VERY good. In terms of drama, the inconsistencies between Mitsuha and Taki's body switching adds up leaving to a more dramatic plot twist that is something of a double red herring, yes the hints towards how Mitsuha and Taki could body switch was obvious quite early on, but what brings ABOUT the major plot twist halfway through the movie is unexpected and brilliantly done to say the least. In terms of mystery, which is linked to the drama given is actually very well managed, leaving no basis for inconsistencies, LA can't say much without going into spoilers but for those who watched the movie you know what LA is saying.
In terms of animation by CoMix Wave Films, well it's not a Makoto Shinkai movie without utterly beautiful scenery and for taking onto both sides of the scenery styles from the rural country side with the utterly gorgeous landscapes to the bustling cityscape. The character designs are very Makoto Shinkai given his style. But yeah you know LA is gonna say it but the background work and overall immense attention to detail, the animation was amazingly gorgeous. Makoto Shinkai you did again!  
In terms of voice acting, the two main characters of Mitsuha and Taki as Mone and Ryunosuke respectively did an utterly amazing job and though LA hasn't heard much of them aside from a couple of roles LA heard from Ryunosuke (Summer Wars) and Mone (Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki), they were the standout performance sin this movie (obviously). From that the minor character voice cast was pretty unique though LA thought LA heard a few famous voice actors (Hi Kana Hanazawa again and Aoi Yuuki, LA thought that was you as Sayaka Natori). Overall excellent voice cast.
The ending to this movie was a great way to end the movie and though it was slightly predictable considering all the hints that lead it to it's ultimatum, LA still liked how the ending ended up as.
What can LA say, but LA understands the hype to Kimi no Na wa and why it's so favoured, sure LA wasn't expecting the comedic skits at the start but once it really dived into the mystery of their body switching as well as develop Mitsuha's and Taki's relationship LA was hooked. What reeled LA in into utterly loving this movie by the end of it was how Kimi no Na wa covered nearly ALL basis in terms of the inconsistencies and VERY subtle hints throughout the plot and the utterly great and slightly predictable payoff by the end of it was the cherry on top of the cake. Kimi no Na wa you deserve the praise you get and LA is gonna say these two statements again.

                This movie took my breath away. I have to admit, I finally get what the hype was all about. In the beginning, I had predicted that it was going to be a pleasant high-school story line, with a fluffy and comedic plot. But, merely 15 minutes in, my guess was proven to be false as I got an idea of the roller-coaster of emotions that were awaiting me. In this review, I will only be putting into words my feelings regarding this movie and much details concerning the plot will not be provided. 
First of all, can we talk about the animation? The alluring and
                  soft animation, satisfying to the eye of the viewer, is the most conspicuous and engaging section of the entire movie, in my opinion. Every single shot and every single transition is done so splendidly that I couldn’t keep my eyes away from the screen. The artwork is to die for. Not to mention the immaculate voice acting that was oddly comforting and dulcet. Finally, the music added to my pleasure, being saccharine and emotive enough to move me to tears at certain points of the film. Needless to say, this was the first anime that brought tears to my eyes. 
The wholesome atmosphere that was meticulously fabricated was on point and made me feel all giddy inside as our two main characters slowly developed a mutual bond of trust and dependence on each other. Even though, it took time for our MC’s to get accustomed to the hell of confusion they were thrown into. I found both, Mitsuha and Taki, adorable and it was amusing to watch each of them peek into each other’s personal lives, especially considering how greatly their respective lives differed from the each other’s. Mitsuha being your average countryside girl and Taki being your usual Tokyo guy. Undoubtedly, I saw specific plot lines of the movie coming from a mile away, however, I was still not prepared to feel completely despairing and powerless when some scenes came into play. 
This is the kind of movie you never forget, even if you intend to. Although, it’s the kind you want to eradicate from your memory in order to be the blessed with the chance to relive and experience it all over again. The kind that makes goosebumps dance along your skin and chills run down your spine because it’s just that heart stirring. Additionally, the kind that forces you into a state of existential crisis for one whole week, making you interrogate yourself on why you were born in such a devastating world.",10,sniper-mask22
32281,"
                Kimi no Na wa is a Fantasy/Supernatural Movie that relies heavily on Romantic themes to push it's narrative, except minus any romantic development what so ever.
The story is based on supernatural elements that are unexplainable and rather convoluted and the romance between the two MC are at the mercy of the pacing of the movie's run time to not only to flush out the supernatural elements, but also manage to develop their relationship in a believable way. Unfortunately the movie fails on both ends where the story needed to be rushed to have an actual conclusion and the romance conveniently developed off baseless interactions, if
                  you could even call them interactions.
Anyways I'd be upset that I spent the entire time watching the movie had it not been eye candy the entire time given it's insane production. They needed this to be a 12 episode run time or split into two movies, because the 1 hour and 52 minutes didn't do this movie justice.",5,Mr_Popepo

But im forgetting what she looks like...
 As if i ever really knew, it happened so fast, im searching for a clue, if it was a true story.

 If the book had pictures, i may get a better picture, and could refresh my memory. 
But where's the book? A distant memory, lost, and fading. I spend countless time hoping, and waiting that it comes to me. A light bulb and i'll remember, preserve and retell. I may even memorize it, if i remember it well. 
The greatest story, I've ever heard. Like a fairy-tale, I find hard to believe, and even perceive. 
The story goes, 
it goes.. It goes? 
and goes, and goes, 
and goes farther in the distance. 
Maybe with every other memory distant.  
Having flash backs as if I was him, with her.. like visions from a past-life, but feel it wasn't long ago. So maybe it really was a dream. Or maybe im remembering how I felt, when I first heard the story... Or maybe, i'am just In-Love, with the story...",10,Alphatreyu

                Kimi no Na wa (Your Name)
Art: The art in this film is spectacular. Every character has unique traits that makes them easily distinguishable. The animation is so fluid and the scenery makes me feel like I am truly immersed in the world of Your Name.The way that the countryside and the big city feel of Tokyo mesh is just absolutely gorgeous and the poster art really reflects that. Being able to watch the colors pop out and the outfits change and the emotion displayed on each characters faces makes this film one best in the art direction department. The way that the hair isn’t perfect
                  and cookie cutter to the way the wind moves through the grass makes me want to live in this universe. If I had to complain about one thing, the fixation on the opening and closing of doors got a little old by the end of the film. 
Sound/Music: The songs used throughout this film are catchy and enjoyable. They fit the moment perfectly and I really enjoyed listening to them. The only thing I had going into this film was the poster and the knowledge that there was a soundtrack available. I didn’t know anything else. But that alone was enough to get me interested. The sound of the wind and the laughter of the townspeople make the world that much bigger and more exciting to be a part of. The little sounds that occur only at really important moments really highlighted the importance of those moments and it was fantastic. 
Story: I can’t say too much without giving things away, but the way that the story of these two kids goes together is amazing. Mitsuah is a teenage girl living in the Japanese countryside and she has become absolutely sick of the mundane and the boring. She longs to be a in her dreams where she can see herself as a male student in the big city of Tokyo, where excitement is endless. Taki is a high school student barely making ends-meat in Tokyo that has an intense love for architectural fine arts. He dreams of living in the countryside as a carefree girl. At first this story was really confusing to me but as it began to pan out things really did make more sense and worked together and became an unforgettable story about two people connected by a comet that passes by only once in 1,000 years.
Personal Reflection: Like I said previously, I had very little to go off of going into this film, but the poster stirred such a curiosity in me that I had to watch it as soon as I could. And boy was I blown away. The plot of this film really confused me at first but after I figured out really what was going on, I fell in love with watching the characters develop and change and grow. I was able to laugh, cry, gasp, and sigh with them. The art style and the music had me focusing on the background, but then I was taken into the story and it took me by the hand and had me exploring all these amazing ideas that I’d heard a hundred times, but I had never heard them told in such an amazing way. A tale of fighting against odds, love, and dreaming, Kimi no Na wa. is amazing, and one of the best films that I have seen in a long while.

                Kimi no Nawa will probably remind you of several movies you've seen before. Mysterious romance? Time hijinks? ring any bells? 
Well,first the story. The flow of the story itself remains active throughout the movie. It doesn't overdo its side stories and focuses on our two main characters. It's probably something you'd enjoy reading instead of watching. It gives an atmosphere of comedy and mystery at the same time. During the climax, it gives you a sorrowful feeling of longing. However, there are several unanswered questions/plotholes. These head scratching plotholes will leave you blank in the end,but no worries,it's still as decent as it is despite
                  its resemblance to other movies/books/shows.
    -   The art and animation is just beautiful. The use of vibrant colors to attract the viewer’s attention, the detailed designs,the accurate portrayal of nature..just beautiful.The character designs are simple but good. The animation runs smoothly and everything about it is just aesthetically pleasing.
  -   The background music is so moving and fits perfectly into each scene. The style,the timing,it’s perfect.

When you already watched some of the work of Shinkai and you liked his previous movies you will not be disappointed in his newest work.
You should also watch Shinkais other works:
Kotonoha no Niwa (The Garden of Words)

For all people who didn´t watch Kimi no Na wa i hope you got encouraged and give it a try.",10,Hestia_Bestia_

                I still can't understand why so many people think this was a masterpiece. It had the most lackluster plot with sporadic time loop elements that really didn't make any sense. 
The soundtrack was decent at best, and it had a homely and slice of life feel to it. Kind of reminds me of those school anime themes.
 The characters really had no development, and absolutely very little depth.
I really had a difficult time trying to enjoy this film due to the switching bodies and unusual story that involved way too much random things happening. 
I feel like the only reason why people liked this anime
                  so much was because of the pretty artwork, which really didn't do much to help the overall quality of the anime. I can't even begin to fathom the fact that it surpassed Spirited away as the highest grossing anime film in the internationally.

It's like being happy, and curious about what's happening on screen and then, brutally coming to tears and more tears...I mean, at some point is a hard heartbreaker. And then it conforts you. It's like an emotional rollercoaster.
Story:
The basis is kind of cliché, used before, but it has a twist that I really wasn't expecting at all, and that absolutely cautivated me.
Art:
The art is fantastic. Amazing landscapes, great animation and vibrant colors. Special mention to tears.
Sound:
I don't usually pay attention to soundtracks because I don't normally like it, but in this
                  case, the songs that play complete are excellent, well choosen, and the ambient music is accurate. I find this outstanding, because it supports the emotions in the movie.
Character:
The male character is good, it's a little away from usual, and his intentions are his most important contribution. But the female...Is amazing, REALLY amazing. She just changes everything she touches and it's absolutely impossible to hate her as the story goes on and you find what she did. One of the best female characters I've seen in my life.
Enjoyment:
Really enjoyable, as I said before, is a mix of emotions. If you can handle it, you will have a fantastic moment. It really touches you.
Overall:
A Top Anime Movie, without a doubt, it's striking and powerfull.",10,H3CN0

I really enjoy this movie and probably one of the best movie I ever watched.
First of all, I really enjoy a deep love story, such as Eureka seven. I love Eureka Seven for its love story.  and I love Kimi no Na wa simply for its love story too.First of all the story :  8
The story mainly focus on romance. And it is a great one. One of the main aspect of the story that I like the most is the pacing. the pacing is good, from the built up to the climax. However I didn't give it a perfect 10 because of the story lack of character development. Which I will describe more in character section.  Still the plot twist really make me enjoy the story although it certainly have plot holes but after i left the show i already feel satisfied and didn't care about the plot hole anymore, and that is a good thing. 
Art : 10
Makoto Shinkai's quality never goes wrong. I give it a perfect because of the level of detail the movie had. Even for the characters in background. The beautiful scenery, a awesome coloring, it is a top notch quality even for a movie standard. The attention to the detail and consistent quality across the movie make it deserve a perfect score.
Sound : 8
The music is good. Good enough to supplement the emotional scene. However it is not memorable enough for me. I give it a solid 8 more because of the voice acting. They did an amazing job bringing the character to life. Especially Mitsuha, she sound really natural, like high school girl supposed to be, she is not overly cute or moe-ish which is good. Creating a layer of realism to the presentation.
Character : 7
Like i said earlier, the movie lack some sort of character development. We barely know all the characters. Mitsuha feel quite the same from beginning to the end,  nothing change. Even if she development we barely know anything about her, except for the body swap problem we barely know her problem. For Taki, he suppose to have some sort of change in his character after the body swapped, but because the movie focus more on Mitsuha on the first half of the movie and didn't quite tell the life of Taki before their body swapped, i didn't feel his character develop because we again barely know him before the swap even though it suppose to be there. So in the end it is quite hard to relate to them.
Enjoyment : 10
I really enjoy this kind of story. Its move me. Memorable. I feel satisfied after I finish the show and enjoy the Roller Coasters of feeling i felt during the show.
Overall a solid 10 no less.
Despite its flaw and plot holes I still think it is one of the best anime i watch in 2016. It will stay in my heart, their pure love story, their efforts and the top notch presentation as well as the amazing detail and visual.",10,Exill

Story: 9/10
The story of this movie is just pretty good. It is really well written, and it made me go ""wow"" so many times. This story is so deep and complex, but also really understandable when you think about it. The ending was absolutely amazing and it made me tear up quite a bit towards the end. The beginning started a little boring in my opinion, but I guess thats also part of the build-up

The art in this
                  show is also so damn good. The part where Taki visits the comet crater, finds an odd bottle, and then swaps bodies with Mitsuha, a really well done artistic part shows. Its so good and I loved it. Also the weather and disaster effects in this movie were amazing

How's that for a review? Pretty vapid? That's exactly what I felt watching Your Name. The romance is pretty much forced, I could juxtapose other characters with Mitsuha and Taki would still pretty much fall in love with Rias Gremory. It just happens to have had nice moments, like what... uhh. 1, 2 or 3? Well pretty much countable with one hand, anything in between is just like my life, bland. Me aside, I mean

                Being that it's currently ranked number one on MAL, and the fact that it was made by ComixWave Films, I had pretty high expectations for Kimi no Na Wa. During the first half of the movie, I probably would've given it a 9/10. The colorful and vibrant visuals plus the character development and hilarious drama really impressed me, and I was understanding why it was so widely loved. However, the more I watched after the first half, the less I started to like it. The silly atmosphere went away, and it became a lot more serious than I feel it needed to. It seems like
                  every modern show just feels the need to have some special meaning behind it, and ends up making your head hurt out of confusion. Even if they felt it necessary to have it take a serious and life threatening route, I think they could've done it in a way that made more sense. I've seen countless people on forums who are just trying to understand the canon story. I know some people like the mystery of them not ""shoving the plot in your face,"" but when I watch a movie, TV show, anime, or really any form of media, I don't want to stress myself out just trying to understand it. With that being said, however, it wasn't bad at all. I'm just a bit disappointed I couldn't enjoy it as much as most of the MAL community seems to.",7,jacobburke54

                I'm bored and I want a break from reviewing bad anime, so that's why I now review Your Name.
From when I first heard about Your Name, I wanted to watch it. Then three months ago I finally bought the DVD and watched Your Name. And of course, I loved it. This has so many qualities that make it almost a perfect masterpiece, sadly the writing isn't that strong. Switch bodies and ask a single question, this is my review of Your Name.
Story: 8/10 [Spoilers!]
Mitsuha wished she lived in the city and Taki wished he lived on the countryside. They switch from bodies with eachother and
                  so their crazy adventure begins. The biggest flaw of Your Name, which is pointed more out then the characters in SAO, are the plotholes. On the halfway it is revealed that they not only switched from bodies, but also travelled through time. It is a excellent plottwist, but when you actually think about it it falls apart. How did they not know that they travelled through time? Couldn't they just look at the date on their Phone? Also, Your Name just doesn't explain things enough, from why they switch bodies to how got suddenly amnesia. The only things that closely resemble a explination is some symbolism and trippy imaginary. Great story, hurt by the plotholes.
Art: 10/10
I just can't deny it: The art is breathtaking. The animations, the light, composition, visual variety, it is all fucking amazing. This is the most beautiful anime I have ever seen… ever!
Sound: 9/10
The OST and the sound design are also fantastic. While the OST is not my cup of tea, I can't deny how quality it is. Such emotional music just gets your heart pumping.
Character: 7/10
The characters are the most underwhelming part of this movie. I could watch Your Name over and over again and I still couldn't tell you what the personalities of Mitsuha and Take were. They are pretty flat and is the only thing that felt not on par with the quality of Your Name. Are they terrible in any way? No, not even close. They do their job and are still enjoyable characters, but man are they underwhelming.  
Enjoyment: 9/10
There are only a few anime I was on the edge of crying: Angel Beats, Made In Abyss… and Your Name. It is incredibly impactful and touches your soul in the deepest parts without being shocking like in Angel Beats or Made In Abyss. I loved it. Only if the comedy was a little better and a few scenes were scrapped because they were boring, then I would've give my experience a 10.  
Overall: 9/10
Just watch it. The praise it is getting from all around the world is not for nothing. Doesn't matter what kind of anime fan you are or even if are a fan of anime, you should watch this anime. It is something amazing, it is something entertaining, it is something that touches your soul.

No, but in all seriousness, I found myself literally wracked with anxiety pulling for the characters, hoping with all my heart for the desired ending. It ends up being contrived, but that's OK; I don't think my heart could have taken it any other way.
The OST fits the movie beautifully, and the landscapes and animation are top notch. Haven't seen an anime that looks this good in a while.
Character development isn't the strongest in existence as it felt like it was based on some certain tropes, but the experiences feel genuine and the body switching was a delightful
                  choice that added a new layer of depth to the story.

                I am one to not watch and write reviews on movies, but this movie compelled me to do so. This was one hell of a roller coaster of a movie. I highly recommend you guys to atleast check it out.
Here's why:
Story(9)
The story is a romance about a girl and a boy who are connected by a certain event. As they go to sleep they wake up in the morning in each other's bodies. Already the story seems cliche and well....done before, however i'm a firm believer in execution. And my god do they nail ""execution"" out of the park. The story's context is very beautiful
                  and is even supported all the way through by other components.
Art(10)
I did mention the context of the story's beauty, That notion is supported by the gorgeous backgrounds, and impressive art. It's a given that the animation is up to movie quality, but the combination between the 2 gives the movie life and fluidity...
Sound(9)
The music is well used, great tracks in general. Each track fits the scene and goes to set the overall tone of curiosity 
Characters(9)
Now the characters in this movie is the dream work. The instant charisma that you feel from the 2 main characters is incredible. They also both had interesting reactions to finding themselves in another person's body. Although what you'd expect, the execution is key in each scene.
Mitsuha Miyamizu: A girl who lives in a small town on the countryside. She wishes to one-day travel to the city of Tokyo. She receives this dream when she eventually switches places with the male lead “Taki”.
Taki Tachibana: A boy who lives in Tokyo that would switch places with the female lead Mitsuha. 
Finally overall the way this movie subtly characterizes the main characters is a nice touch…If you haven’t seen this movie yet. I challenge you to watch it and learn atleast one thing from the 2 characters without them telling the audience
Enjoyment(10)
This movie is just enjoyable to the last letter. Even at the end when it seems predictable it creates a sense of hopelessness and tensity that keeps you rooting for them both to the very end… 
Overall(9)
 This movie shows what you can do with the small things within writing a coherent story, subtle characterization, clever execution, and especially foreshadowing. This movie accomplishes all of these things. I highly recommend this movie, I don’t think anyone will regret it

I'll try keeping my review spoiler-less as much as I can
I gotta say that I got pretty confused about this switch of Mitsuha and Taki, i couldn't know when Mitsuha is really Mitsuha or Taki in Mitsuha's body, excluding this little problem, the
                  movie was so great and I really recommend it to anyone ^^

                     Alright, I finally got around to watching the super famous and hyped Kimi no Na wa and I have some review like opinions on the movie. WE got some spoilers but I will do my best to be minimal if you’re reading this before watching. To begin, I want to first get the animation and sound out of the way. They were pretty hecking gorgeous. The only issue with the animation could be the contrast between characters and the background in certain scenes but dang was it a beautiful thing to watch. I paused it every now and then just
                  to look at it and go “woooooow.” Soundtrack also good we got RADWIMPS and they complement the movie well adding very fitting music to many of the scenes. 
    Okay we got the good stuff done bam great. Now I had some issues with this movie. Now of course I’m coming at the movie with quite an eye on it as it is the highest rated anime movie on this site, however I liked it a ton more than I thought I would. The way the plot is laid out in the first half of the movie is quite exquisite. The mystery and confusion that the characters have in their situation is mirrored by the viewers in trying to solve the question. The buildup to the climax is also really phenomenal. I was getting chills when the big reveal happened.
    This is however where things go downhill. Now this is of course natural to plot as the climax would be the highest but I mean the plot gets weaker as elements are added and it just seems to get confused about itself. What exactly is the plot about? I was wondering this at the end of my viewing as I was not really sure. Was it a love story, a mystery, a tale of fortune telling to prevent disaster??? I got lost. The forced romance that I felt the movie was building too also seemed too fast since they did not really know each other at all. They knew of each other and interacted through there journal entries. Then bam we got the words on the hand and it was wild.
    Kimi no Na wa is a fantastic anime movie but it does too much in my humble opinion. I am left with a lot of questions that I sort of have to self-justify through internal debates. The time travel, dream switching, loss of memory, loss of record, the missing memories, and finally how are they going to constantly feel something is missing yet they cannot even remember their name literally 20 seconds after shouting it at the sky.

                This was the first anime movie I watched that wasn't a Ghibli or kids movie. I watched this when I was in the unripe age of 12, the peak of my edginess and weirdness. I watched this at the end of the school year with some classmates on their laptop, though not from the beginning, but early enough that I understand the plot. That was about 4 years ago. After a full rewatch, I felt like writing a review
Story: 6
The story may be a bit confusing but quite simple in big picture. You can guess where the movie will go, but its still very enjoyable.
                  one thing I will say about the story of this movie is that it is lacking in depth and paced too quickly. The romance between the two main leads seemed lacking and was basically plot service. Other plot points weren't discussed as much and things either developed too quickly or didn't develop enough. 
Animation: 10
This movie has one of, if not the most beautiful animation of all time. From the lighting, movement and details in each frame, it made me pause the movie once in a while to truly admire the production. This was big factor to my enjoyment and feel from the movie.
Sound: 9
The music done in this film was done by a rock band, which seems quite weird for a romance movie but works very well. The music brings a sense of teenage rebellion, foolishness and youth. It really reminds you that these are just teenagers in their youth and that they are only following their heart.
Characters: 6
I really felt that the characters were very likeable however lacking in their motives, personality and emotions. Even though if you can understand why these things are done by the characters, it feels like we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg. They didn't develop enough and personally I didn't feel attached to them.
Enjoyment: 9
Despite the film's objective flaws, I had a lot fun watching it, there's a lot to like about this film. Diverging and converging paths and destinies with people is something I hear a lot from older folk and something I have learned from. It tells a great importance to our past and memories. At the time of writing this, I am only 16. But I am sure there is a lot out there, both experiences and people
Overall: 7.5
Despite all my praises, this movie ain't that good. Very overrated in my honest opinion. I think the Garden of Words and 5 Centimeters per Second were the better works of Shinkai. That being said, I think you should lay back and not overanalyze things to enjoy this movie.",7,Kr1m1naL

                Wow!!! I am speechless! This movie was so good I can barely make an actual coherent review about it, I guess I'm still in shock.
The story was truly well written, it was emotional roller-coaster without doubt. I laughed and I cried (oh so much tears) but it was truly incredible.
I was honestly scared the movie would end up in a cliffhanger or that it would have end up in disappointment, but it had a good ending actually. It really touched my heart and for me that's impressive mostly because I don't really enjoy the romance type.
I have to say I was very confused in the
                  beginning but luckily things started to make sense. It's really worth a shot watching this beautiful emotional movie.
I truly have no words for this amazing piece, I saw a many good things before watching  this movie and I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did.",10,Another_Nobody
32281,"
                You know, the main problem about Makoto Shinkai is that he doesn't know how to tell a different story. Everything he writes is just the same. Your Name is nice, but Shinkai took like about ten failed attempts to finally make something passable. It's not essentially different from Voices of a Distant Star, The Garden of the Words or The Place Promised in Our Early Days.
If I didn't know about Shinkai and any of his work before and watched Your Name without any previous knowledge, it definitely would be a more enjoyable movie. Reminds me a lot fo La La Land, but with a pretty
                  happier ending. 
And I still don't know why this movie is such a phenomenon. Is not like anything that hasn't been made before. Ok, it’s a good movie, the first Shinkai work that is entertaining and not just plain boring, but I’ve seen a lot of Japanese anime movies that are a lot better, like Bakemono no Ko, Omoide no Marnie, Kaguya-Hime no Monogatari and Hotaru no Haka. Damn, even Redline is more refreshing, innovative and bold than Your Name.",8,Creissonino

                This is by far one of the best animated movies I've seen recently.  Such a perfect blend of drama, romance, and a little suspense thrown in as well.  I've always been a sucker for the ""switching bodies"" concept common in movies and TV, but I don't think I've ever seen it done as well as it was done here.  Normally movies with this premise go for jokes involving the character exploring their body and being weirded out.  While there was some of that here, it didn't really do it that much as this was a drama and not a comedy. 
                  That alone is why I appreciate this so much.  This is one of the first times I've seen a common premise in comedy films used for dramatic purposes, and having it come out in the end as plausible and actually working for its benefit in the end.  There's so much weight to the feelings the characters have, and its expressed brilliantly through the animation as well.  At times I even forgot I was watching an anime, it was so well executed.  My only complaint is just a nitpick in that the plot sometimes goes all over the place plot-wise.  It does answer a lot of the questions raised by the viewer, but some of them are answered very vaguely in a way that not everybody can catch on to.
Other than that, this is a must see.  Probably the most beautiful and touching anime I've ever seen.",10,OahuOtaku

                Massively surprised by this original, and very beautiful film
Some friends of mine are currently taking it in turns selecting a film to watch.  My previous turn was Redline, which was quite frankly, putting the animation to one side, garbage.  This type of film is one that wouldn't be my first choice.  Mainly because I'm a simple man, i want action and stunning animation, but mainly action.  Classically, this film is in 3 simple parts, beginning, middle and end.  With this in mind, my review below will follow the same vein.
The Beginning
From the moment Your Name starts, you are immediately drawn
                  in to the story.  It paces the start to the story so perfectly that you want to focus on its progress rather than having to over think trying to  follow whats going on.  It becomes obvious very quickly what is happening, and the character development really shines in such a short period of time, as the two main character become more familiar with each other circumstances, you can sense a subtle affection growing that is charming.  Yet even though their relationship develops, Your Name does a wonderful job of not progressing two quickly.
The Middle
This is where our first big reveal comes and its delivered perfectly.  The story pacing up to this point is perfect and it continues as such.  The twist in the plot really hits you.  This is where you find out how much you have invested in the characters without even realising.  The supporting characters play a very important role here and add just enough to the story to not be frustrating like some supporting characters are in other anime, but rather really likable.  And so the fantastic writing continues....
The End
Honestly.....i cried OK!, not at the very end, but there is one moment that builds to the perfect climax you simply cannot help but let the tears go.  Looking at it simply, its been done many many times in films, its just the way it was delivered that was so perfect.  Absolutely stunning writing.  
As we near towards the end you feel it drawing to a close, not in a rushed way, in the exact same way the entire story has been told, brilliantly.  Once we do get to the conclusion, you are perfectly happy, not overwhelmed with emotion, frustrated, devastated etc, just happy, and that is exactly how it should have been.
Oh...animation is stunning too!

story :- the story is not like something that comes in a decade or comes by acheiving masterclass in writing . it's just plain and simple and those who are more into anime can expect what happens next. At first i thought concept is different but it lost track so easily
Art :- Art really deserves good marks. the only aspect i enjoyed
Sound :- it's not clearly audible and sometimes sound doesn't do a good job here. but sometimes its better to add it when the scenes are intense.
Character :- during the 1st half characters are like great. but they get their graph falling , falling and falling.
enjoyment :- YUP, I SUCCESSFULLY WASTED A nearly 2 hours for this film.
OVERALL :- those who  are new into anime and are not picky then go watch this. but those experts out there, its just a same old ass story",4,kingsenpai05

                While the story may not be the most technically tight, and while it is far from devoid of narrative conveniences, you will not care. This is because the way this film manages to capture your attention and successfully hit emotional highs is second to none.
Despite the somewhat messy start, the film manages to piece itself together rather quickly and once it has reached that point its full steam ahead. Sure, most of the supporting cast are undeveloped, and the characters are not wholly original, but these issues are the furthest thing from your mind once you reach the end credits. This film is about something
                  less tangible, a feeling, and it succeeds in expressing this to the viewer effortlessly.

                ""Your Name"" is a masterpiece by Makuto Shinkai, it's an ageless film that does in fact gives you a vibe than leaves you awe struck. Being an emotionally strong film, it does a good job of transitioning well from light comedy to an deep melodramatic romance. Falling in love with someone without actually meeting them but by being in thier body, knowing there story and actually trying to live in that is a beautiful and innovative concept for a Romance. Every ingredient whether it's the screenplay, character visualisation, narration, background score and story makes the perfect blend for a movie worth watching.

After Garden of Colors, a short flim that tells a romance story so good and well executed, I didnt expect that Your Name woud be as the same caliber as it predescessor, but I was wrong! An emotional rollercoaster towards the end! It will surely makes you think more about our dreams, if it doesnt have a more deeper meaning than its randomness or based in what you experienced in the real life. Worth every minute!

                Okay, soo... There is two main paths that you will most likely take when you’ve finished watching this movie... The first one, increasingly more popular, is the one where you think it really wasn’t that good, and the flaws that this movie has (yes, I recognize it has a bunch of those even if I gave it a perfect score lol) are very visible to you even in the first watch. You probably won’t think much about it and will actually, but oddly, be on the same page as the very director, Makoto Shinkai,who thinks this movie could’ve been much better. Now, the second one,
                  and the one I obviously went through, is literally being star struck. Like, being transported to a different dimension, when you watch it for the first, second, third time... Why? Because all of the jokes landed for me, all the plot twists made sense in my head, because it nailed every emotional moment without making it to cheesy and letting you breathe, because the undeniably astoundishing soundtrack and animation together blew my mind... Well, just literal magic. This is actually something many people experience, and this movie instantly becomes a synonym of the world “beautiful” in our minds. So that’s why I think EVERYONE, and I mean EVERYONE should watch your name at least once. You know, to see if you have that freaky connection with it too. And that’s why I recommend this movie to everyone I know and now to you, reading this, because if you watch and love it as much as I do it will really mean something. I understand it’s far from prefect, and how far it objectively is from being a “masterpiece” but please please don’t let this stop you from having this hour and a half experience. Because it will make you VERY happy and appreciative of life, and if it doesn’t, you’ve lost nothing trying, and I’m sure you will find THAT movie that makes you feel that way, euphoric. Sorry for the absolute garbage review, not even stating the genre or touching the movies direction or things as such, but I just really want you to watch this, if anyone really is reading. If you’ve made it this far... might as well watch it lol. Idk. I’m shitty at writing. At everything really. But I love this movie very mucho. Bye and  thank you for reading!",10,mustyweeabo

                This might be the best movie I've ever watched. The story is one of the most creative out of love related anime movies. The art is almost perfect and nothing I could be picky about. There won't much sounds, but the singing at the end was just perfect to let the story sink into me. Characters were well developed, nothing I can say that's bad about it, though it might be the weakest 10 compared to the rest. I'm not going to lie, but I enjoyed every moment of the movie, it was not the genre I'm into, but I just couldn't stop! So it
                  has to be a 10 overall and probably one of my all time favourite anime.",10,EdSparta
32281,"
                I don't know what to say. 
I'm truly feeling rather listless, as I just cannot even begin to fathom this creation. I'm at a loss for words; but if I got anything left, here goes. 
---
Prior to watching this anime I heard a lot about it. I read the description and saw the overwhelmingly positive feedback it received, although never really took it upon myself to watch it. I'm not really a huge fan of romance anime (and romance in general), nor am I one to sit down and dedicate roughly two hours worth of my time to a show; but I mean, the premise
                  sounded kinda interesting. Simple, but interesting, and after all it did indeed receive all this incredible praise... so in the dead of the night, I found myself watching Kimi no Na wa, for I just couldn't bear the curiosity no longer; why was it so good? I never really received an answer to that, even now, for words cannot explain. 
I won't talk about the general ratings I give on the story and art, or any of that jazz... I'll just talk about it, I guess. First off, to say the least, I found myself kinda mesmerized by the beautiful graphics and fluid animation that this movie contained; I mean, it all looked bright and frankly quite pretty. It's rather appealing to the eyes, but even more so than one could possibly imagine. All of the scenes, literally every second worth of screen time is perfected; there was not one moment I could correct. Not to mention that I have particularly high expectations when it comes to overall animation in a film; very rarely would I consider those expectations to be exceeded. Kimi no Na wa did that. 
But the art and animation is just the very surface of the... well, onion that this movie is. I say onion for it has layers upon layers of churning depth that lure the viewer into this fantastical, fictional world; a rather sophisticated way of talking about an onion, yes. But the main point that I'm trying to focus on here is that... it's just, I don't really know how to put it; upon watching it the first time, you won't quite be capable of completely fathoming it; you will likely have but a inkling of the trail this movie leads you on. Is there any sequels, and do you need to rewatch it to get that effect? No, for it will come naturally; your mind will be paralyzed on the thought of this movie and unknowingly you'll unravel the pieces and be able to just partially understand the create that is Kimi no Na wa. I believe there are many surfaces to this piece yet to have been broken by even those with the most keen of eye. How could I possibly imagine such a bottomless world that is Kimi no Na wa, how could I possibly be able to delve into this unsolvable puzzle? It is not frustrating trying to fit the pieces together, but rather a exercise that would typically make me content. It is beautiful, and rewarding in it's own way. 
Another one of the exterior, yet absolutely brilliant surfaces of Kimi no Na wa is the utterly beautiful soundtrack; I admit, I cannot remember most of the music featured within the movie, but what I do remember is that feeling; that paralysis in which I became so entranced within these beautiful melodies. In which numbed my brain in such a way that I cannot even begin to recall. For each setting, the music follows in blissful harmony; once more, I do not find a single note that I can correct. Truly stunning, truly outstanding tones that shape the mood, the atmosphere and the feeling that practically radiates off of whatever screen one is gazing at... both in that of tragedy and love, it never fails to impress. 
I want to focus more on the overall experience however; but before I do that I need to get the whole character thing off my shoulders. Yes, I do believe the two main characters were absolutely brilliantly contrasted, but I admit the others fell a little short; that doesn't mean they were bad by any means at all, and they were in fact still fantastic, but there essentially could've been more development on their part. That being said, that is much of a false argument seeing as Makoto was able to portray so much in the mere span of roughly two hours; adding extra character development could've ruined the beauty that this is. 
But moving on- the experience. I- as I previously stated- am not a huge fan of romance anime; I find it rather uncomfortable to watch at times and dislike a overwhelming romantic appeal between two characters. In fact, a couple hours prior to watching this I had watched the train wreck that is ef: a tale of memories (which I wrote a review on). With my opinion already obscured, that completely tore apart romance anime for me; while I was sure that there had to surely be better out there, I couldn't look away from the horrible experience I had with ef. I thought it was likely I wouldn't watch a romance anime for awhile, but the curiosity was far too much to bear; so then came along Kimi no Na wa, and as if a light flicked on my vision was cleared. 
Furthermore, I never cry. Often times when something sad comes along I find myself at struggle to become emotional; I can barely so much as get sad, and thus it is nearly impossible for me to shed a tear over fictional works such as anime, despite me thoroughly enjoying them. I'd been looking for something that could provoke emotion within me, that could stir what seemed to be my still heart to life; I'd been searching for awhile for one series, any series, that just gave me this crushing and yet hopeful feeling. And while during the beginning of Kimi no Na wa- despite being a little on the emotional side- I couldn't shed a tear, I soon found myself practically sobbing at my computer, gazing blankly at the screen. I didn't even realize I was crying at first; and when I did it was already too late to stop. Even now I'm not sure whether it was tears of joy, or tears of sadness; but must I say, it felt good. It'd been awhile since something had stirred up such feeling within me. 
Kimi no Na wa... there was moments I chuckled, smiled, and then cried... I remember upon finishing the movie I found myself shaking; I just... couldn't really fathom what'd just happen to me. Tears were still pooling down my cheeks at the time, and I remember talking to my sister and chuckling rather breathlessly after every sentence. I remember sleeping that night with a smile on my face, I remember waking up with a smile on my face; I felt hope. A hope far unimaginable to those who have never experienced it; just hope, pure and raw, and it felt... well, great to say the least. With my heart pounding so firmly within my chest I just felt an urge to move forth, an urge to conquer... I felt at peace with myself. I felt happy with myself. While some would think otherwise, for all humans, that's kind've a rare feeling... a time in which I can be free of doubt, of judgement or of worry. Even if it only lasted for that one night, the effect that this movie had on me will continue to push me forth. I feel more connected with all my dreams, more in touch with all my goals and ready to pursue the path to where I aim to be; I don't really know what to say... It kinda spoke to me, y'see. I just feel as if the clouds have begun to clear... it feels good, really good. 
So, will I recommend this anime to you? I'll go with I guess. I say that because this is a rare beauty, a film that you must decide to watch yourself... decide when your ready to sit down and spend roughly two hours staring at a screen, and keep in mind, it's worth it. If you're feeling down, look no further, for this... whatever this majestic creation is has arrived.",10,Kozakii

'Kimi no Na wa' gets a lot of acclaim from critics and just anime watchers alike, but regardless of what they say, this movie hit me in the feels at the perfect time in my life.  I swear to Jesus when those meteors fell, I felt something I've never, ever felt before.  The soundtrack and beautiful visuals aside, that feeling ALONE warrants an easy 10.

MILD SPOILERS:
I will talk a little bit about what I thought could have been done better.  For one, the story somewhat went on an acid trip when Taki
                  drank the saliva alcohol, or whatever.  Suddenly went all sicko mode on the audience and I was confused for a bit.  I think the somewhat deus ex machina where the meteor hits but everyone is actually alive was relatively well executed.  In that moment and the moments preceding it, the watcher is stunned by the visual and audial bliss of the meteor scene and in awe and shock when the meteor collides right after, creating that sense of a mixture of bliss and sadness.  Story was relatively linear other than that.
The characters were a little bit forgettable.  Sure, you can google 'taki twixtor clips' to put in your low effort AMV and you'll get plenty of results, but the characters weren't anything special.  They were just two variables in the powerful wave that is 'Kimi no Na wa.'

                This is most definitely a Makoto Shinkai movie. The story carries a lot of that iconic distance and searching you see in his works, this film in particular hitting plenty of similar notes as ""Five Centimeters Per Second"". The main difference I see from ""Your Name"" to that is the inclusion of an interesting supernatural plot-element that doesn't correspond with Five Centimeters' focus on total realism. ""Your Name"" isn't as meaningful as Five Centimeters because of this though as it tries to tell a similar story with nothing to ground it and learn from, but it's definitely entertaining to watch. I was beginning to think
                  the days of fully-animated movies were coming to an end, but this is a good wake-up call. The movie looks fantastic and sounds pretty good as well, while the soundtrack can get a little basic at times. But the presentation isn't all that carries this, the supernatural side plays well with the hyper-realistic setting giving lots of opportunities to realize and explore how this would affect people's lives (while it's kinda been done before). The movie isn't too focused on exploring it's supernatural side though and is definitely directing for a dramatic tear-jerker. Suffice to say, this actually didn't manage the tear-jerker part with me having seen plenty of better romance story-lines. The drama element of this movie also didn't try to be as unique as it could've been and goes for a route that I'm sure plenty of you will be familiar with.
I hear people saying ""Your Name"" is the greatest anime movie ever made. Do I think that? Not at all, but it's definitely one of the better anime movies to come out recently. I saw that Makoto Shinkai himself never expected the turnout he got here, even feeling nervous over it. So, honestly, I'd say don't get too caught up in the hype before trying out this movie. It's got some good stuff going for it and will likely be entertaining to just about everybody, but it doesn't stray off the beaten path enough to become the classic I'd hope it'd be. This story would've done much better in anime form with more time to flesh out the characters and actually show the experiences that gets montaged by. And I must mention that is one thing I have never fully settled with in Makoto's directing, he always wants to get to the point so fast he breezes past everything. The movie always moves at such a fast pace it's hard to get too accustomed to it.
So I'd say ""Your Name"" is a solid vision of tried and true anime story elements and I think anyone could give it a go and get something out of it. However, if you're one who really wants a meaty film with tons of themes and meaning to be interpreted, ""Your Name"" just doesn't have that. It's a moderate melodrama movie with entertaining supernatural side-shows.
And now that I'm so far down here, time to spoil it all with a five-word review:
Angel Connect... No, Kokoro Beats!",8,BlokeTokes
32281,"
                Your Name. is a true spectacle of cinema. I had the opportunity to watch this film on the night of my birthday and I have to say, it's one of the best birthday gifts I have ever received. I desperately tried to lower my expectations as I walked into the cinema, knowing full well the hype the movie had been gaining as well as the records it had been breaking. As soon as the film begun however, with a meteor rocketing through the clouds into a wide open view, I knew that it was going to be something special. 
It goes without saying that the
                  music makes this movie. RADWIMPS have created a stunning soundtrack that turns the film into a feature length music video. The beat of each insert song is timed to perfection with scene changes and camera positioning, creating a perfect sense of rhythm that brings forth character emotion. 'Zen Zen Zense' in particular creates an immense amount of energy and excitement that mirrors the lives of Taki and Mitsuha. These insert songs are so strong that I find myself constantly listening to them. 
The film takes the simple premise of body swapping and expands upon it to explore more serious issues, including a social commentary on the natural disasters that affect Japanese society. By being able to view the lives of two characters who live in completely different environments we are able to see how connected we all truly are. The film has a very easy going progression, almost emulating the pace of a slice of life anime until the story escalates into something much more profound and impactful. The particular scene of this escalation is so profound in fact that I can still perfectly visualize it in my head.
The stellar animation of Your Name. allows for an incredibly realistic world to be created. Every scene is highly detailed with incredible shots of cityscapes and lush greenery looking absolutely beautiful on the big screen. This sense of realism adds much more of a connection to the film as a viewer as we begin to relate to the places that we are seeing and empathize with the characters.
Your Name. deserves every bit of praise that it has received. To this day I still have feelings of joy and amazement that something so spectacular was able to be produced. Not only do I think this is one of the best anime films of all time, I believe it is a truly groundbreaking piece of artwork in the world  of cinema. The cinematography of the film has been handled with so much care and I can't wait to see what Makoto Shinkai creates next. It's not everyday that I say an anime is life changing, but for Your Name. I can certainly say that is true. I now look up at sunsets or evening views and can see the same vibrant colors presented in the film. For me it has made me appreciate my own world even more than I could have ever imagined.",10,Green_Gecko
32281,"
                This is a really sweet film. This anime has one of the most vibrant color palettes I have ever seen on screen and its animation clearly was worked on with a lot of hard work. To top it, the plot is really sappy and kind of melodramatic, but I don't think this necessarily hurts the film. People who love slice-of-life/romantic animes will get a kick out of this film, but I can't promise others that they will appreciate it as much since the third act does drag on and the use of music is a bit excessive creating a feeling of disingenuous drama.
For me, I
                  did tear up a bit. The hand-painted cells are just amazing and I can be a sucker for sappy romance. And the plot does give something to the audience member to engage on. If I was more tolerable of the ""Anime Music Video"" vibes I was getting from this film, I might have rated it higher. I implore everyone to give this film a try and hopefully you'll get more out of this film than I did.",8,Fredinkins
32281,"
                Absolutely phenomenal. Kimi no Na wa (Your Name) might be my favorite anime movie ever, and that's not an easy title to get. The story masterfully mixes drama, suspense, romance, comedy, and slice of life together in an amazing way I've never seen done before.
The story revolves around two main characters: Taki, a highschool boy living in Tokyo, and Mitsuha, a highschool girl living in the countryside. Inexplicably, the two find themselves in each others bodies with no idea why and with no idea of who the person who's life they're living is. 
Story: 10/10 This movie has three main arcs (which I won't spoil)
                  that all are so expertly connected that the many twists and surprises in the plot aren't even noticeable until maybe a few minutes before they happen. The entire story is captivating all the way through and you honestly won't be able to guess what happens next.
Art: 9/10 The art is amazing, very realistic drawing style (for an anime at least) and the emotions of the characters are beautifully shown, from surprise to sadness to anger to embarrassment. Not the literal best art I've ever seen but definitly superb.
Sound: 9/10 Music isn't overused but isn't used as much as other anime movies (which isn't a bad thing); they use the intro song twice in the movie and have three times in the movie where they show a montage of events put to music. The music is very enjoyable, but not as memorable as other anime movies.
Character: 10/10 Both characters are extremely likable. You feel for both characters plights (Mitsuha more so as her backstory is more fleshed out) but it is very easy to cheer for them the whole way through. The fact that the story hides the plot twists until almost the moment they happen makes it even easier to like the characters as their struggles and reactions are usually the same as yours.
My words can't bring justice to how superb this anime is. If you're marginally interested at ALL about Drama, Mystery, Romance, or really just anime in general (unless you only like Shonen), this is an absolute must watch.",10,Vaydren
32281,"
                YOUR NAME. In case you forgot how well-made anime can stir up emotions. Well, get ready for the feels.
Written and directed by Makoto Shinkai, Your Name. takes a seemingly simple body-swap fantasy and evolves it into something much, much more remarkable. If you're at all familiar with Shinkai's previous works, you know he's got a special knack for creating rich, provocative dramas with a sci-fi bent. Your Name. is no different.
Mitsuha and Taki are two of the most instantly-likable and relatable characters I've met in a good long time. I guarantee you will be rooting for both of them with equal intensity by the time
                  the movie reaches its final stretch. But the journey there is filled with some surprisingly profound twists.
If the movie was *just* a body-swap tale and nothing more, I would've enjoyed it for what it was. But at some point in the story, Your Name. takes a drastic tonal shift that will probably divide audiences. Personally, that shift took me from pleasantly liking the experience to becoming completely *captivated* with it. It's not entirely unpredictable if you've watched/read enough works in the genre. But that doesn't diminish what the movie sets out to achieve. Your Name. got me *good*, and I loved it.
P.S. Even though I wish the movie didn't feature so many musical montages, I'd be lying if I didn't admit to playing Radwimps' ""Zenzenzense"" nonstop on my way home from the theater. That song rules, and their Human Bloom album is seriously dope.",8,JediNut
32281,"
                Kimi no Na wa sits not only at the top of AnimeLlist, but at a score of 9.4 it is miles ahead of the next top runners. I will try to argue why I think it is a good but not exceptional movie. 
Spoilers below. 
The plot takes some creative licenses to force drama that are hard to forgive. The main male character is selectively an amnesiac to increase drama in a way that can feel cheap and unnecessary, especially when he loses memory of the name immediately after repeating it over and over. Somehow in the entirety of his experience, he never once had
                  the year or the name of the town mentioned to him, nor did the girl, otherwise the big reveal would already be known to them.  The grandmother is randomly and ineffectively revealed to be a baba-yaga style all knowing sage, which just makes the plot seem cheesy at that point.
Most importantly, though, is just that the entire meteor portion of the plot could have been cut and you would probably be left with a better story. Simply have the phenomena suddenly stop after the celestial event with no disaster, and proceed to have a missed-connections theme like Shinkai Makoto's other major movie, 5 Centimeters per Second. 
Which leads into the last major flaw:  Makoto's apparently petrifying fear of writing actual relationships. We saw a smidgeon of one in 5 Centimeters, but he damn well makes sure not to include much actual interaction within the romance, preferring to instead show the angst of love ""forgotten"". Perhaps this is what causes him to love the ""missed connections (AND TRAINS)"" trope so much, which at this point is becoming more of a detriment than a strength to his films. 
All in all, the gorgeous animation and sound, as well as an interesting initial premise, still made it a enjoyable watch for me despite my gripes with the plot. I enjoyed it more than 5 Centimeters, which I gave a 7, so I'll give this one an 8.",8,milkblob

It has some beautiful thoughts, scenes and ideas and I can tell that I will remember it with a smile and nostalgia later in life. It isn't a masterpiece in my opinion because it's very fast and we don't have the time to start caring for main characters that much. Still, I recommend it to everyone

I loved the twilight meeting: ""Its Ok, you still have time"", what a boss!, and the climax. And the ending! OMG! Who wasn't screaming their heads off! You will know when you see it. 
I love anime that pull in elements of time travel. I think that time travel and all
                  of that is so interesting and this anime does it really well.
I have done my best to go back over the story and ensure that the plot is bulletproof and air tight, but there a few elements that don't make 100% sense. But who cares, its practically perfect.

                The first time I ever watched this anime was on an airplane ride. The anime overall has is good part like the romance. However, the bad parts over weigh the good parts including like the story line. The whole anime was just plain and doesn't have any real motives. For example, One piece is to find the One Piece and Naruto is to become the Hokage. [Spoiler] The ending was also very cringe-worthy since the two people passed each other 3 to 4 times and didn't realize it was the same person they wanted to meet.

This is one of those movies that takes you all across your various emotions from tears of sadness to tears of joy! (They were manly tears, dont judge!)
All round great movie. The music is just as amazing with the ending song reaching soul deep. I highly recommend this movie to any whom is going through a rough patch in their life. Its a great reminder of the greater things in life, of the journey of adventure.

                It is not very often that a story centered primarily around a romance can manage to be enticing. Romance, by itself, I find to be a rather mundane focal point for a story. After all, everyone, to various degrees, understands and wants romance. Relatability does not directly translate to interest. Romance typically serves a story better when it is a subplot while something else with significant consequence takes center stage. This allows for a more diverse and important cast while also allowing the love interest in question to develop around that grander conflict, giving it some much needed sustenance.
By contrast, Your Name, or Kimi no
                  Na wa, manages to create a romance that stands on its own for a large portion of the film, long before a grander conflict is fully presented to the audience. Your Name achieves this through its unique juxtaposing of the two love interests (something that cannot be explained without spoilers). The outstanding visuals and sound design aid this to no end, making it one of the best animated films of the year, if not all time, in terms production quality. (However, I personally did not like some of the music) The production quality is a boon because, unlike others such as A Silent Voice, Spirited Away, or Land of the Lustrous, Your Name does not have a deep, meaningful point behind the story that could stand on its own even if other aspects of the presentation could not. (Here's a good time to note that Your Name does have a *glaring* plot hole). Your Name is not trying to be deep and philosophical to leave you with something that keeps you analyzing the ""message"" of the story. It is merely trying to be pleasant, inspirational, heartwarming, and beautiful -- and it achieves exactly that. Your Name is... ""nothing more or less... than a breathtaking view.""",9,ASpitefulRose

                Now before I start my review of this movie, I would like to say that my review will probably seem simple compared to the previously written ones because, if I had to be completely honest, I didn't grasp every single aspect of the movie (I'm just not that perspective aha ^^) Also, I am writing this fifteen minutes after I finished the movie, so I am a little emotionally unstable, which will probably result in my writing and grammar not being top notch.
So, as mentioned, I looked through some of the reviews before I watched to movie to get an idea of how good this
                  movie truly is, and they were phenomenal. 97% of the critics loved this movie, and if I had to be completely honest, I was a little skeptical because how can a movie be to be universally loved by every person with varying preferences and opinions. But nevertheless, I gave it a shot because everything has a reason.
To start off, let's talk about the art, animation, and soundtrack of this movie. . . It was amazing. The animation of the movie made it look like the entire thing was filmed on camera even though it WASNT because ya know its an ANIMATIOn. The art was so beautiful with its soft and bright colors. The drawings of the landscape, whether it be the countrysides or the city, looked like they were painted with watercolors individually. The colors blurred and blended together so beautifully and I just CRY. I'm not one for art appreciation and I most certainly am not one of this artsy people who are moved by paintings (it's just not my style, nothing personal) BUT the art shown in this movie actually tugged at my heartstrings and made me FEEL things. I knew this movie was known among the community to be emotional, but I didn't expect the SCENIC art to bring waves of emotions. I was SHOOK. Also 10/10 music choices, I will be listening to this soundtrack until the day of my death and will probably have the soundtrack playing at my funeral as they lower my dead body into the ground.
So, moving on from my art related emotions, let's talk about my emotions for the story. Now the story is really simple, but there are several elements that were slightly more abstract, especially if you are not familiar with the cultures and traditions of Japan. However, the confusion brought upon due to lack of cultural awareness will not dampen your enjoyment of this movie. 
So the basic plot (as seen in the synopsis) was very sweet and feel good. With themes fate, youth, and innocence, that was no surprise to me. What surprised me though was the more abstract themes. Even though I did not completely comprehend what was going on, I could feel the emotions involved. You know in the movies, how when a person gets amnesia and they see an old photograph they don't understand or remember, yet a part of them becomes completely overwhelmed with emotions that seem to come from nowhere? That's what this movie was like. The creators of this movie managed to include people who were not familiar with the cultures of Japan and the people who are not as perspective, and I found that very admirable and impressive.
In short, this movie was just really good, story wise, emotions wise, and art wise. WATCH IT if you havent.",10,vinamillk

                I haven't watch anime for like 3 months, since Re:Life was released. To be honest, recent anime are just kinda blent and offer nothing new to the genre. But as usual, Makoto Shinkai delivered a simple yet beautiful masterpiece. I admit it was more beautiful than his previous masterpiece, 5 Centimeters Per Second
Story : This is the first time Shinkai deliver a story that makes you think just a bit, especially in the middle of the movie ( no spoiler ). Usually, Shinkai's works delivers an emotional rollercoaster with an interesting character, but this time he added it with a little bit of mystery and
                  it truly makes me happy
Art : As usual, Shinkai is the master of anime animation. With a beautiful landscape, a character that really looks like a japanese, and a dedication towards realism makes this movie is really satisfying and enjoyable modern classic
Sound : The voice acting, the surround sound, the soundtrack is really great. The movie wouldn't be the same without those. Sorry I couldn't explain it too many because technically I don't really get what ""sound"" mean.
Character : The character were perfect for this movie. Personally, I really loved the main character because without meeting each other, they can make this movie really alive. Shinkai make Taki and Mitsuha relatable to everyone who had experience teenage time and high school. With a romance between the two, really makes you loved the character. Love Mitsuha <3
Enjoyment : I really enjoy this movie in the middle of the movie. In the beginning, the story just like a casual anime but as soon the story unfold, you wouldn't get enough of this masterpiece even if the credits scene has already rolled.
Overall : Short one for this. ""A truly wonderful masterpiece""",10,pradnyaw

                I don't know how to write a review so this wont be long, but comes just after I watched movie. 
I always loved whole series more, because there was more to see, but in case of 'Kimi no Na wa.' movie was best solution. Enough time to keep people interested, great work on landscape, so many dreams of young people, especially MC, where you could see how they grow through movie.
I was so hyped to watch this movie, and when I finally got time, I used it to in best way I could, to watch 'Kimi no Na wa.' .
Just as story begins you would
                  think that this would be nice romantic anime, but as you watch and get to plot twist ( which I rly liked ) you will see what this anime is rly about. 
This movie was a real rolecoaster of feelings, I felt so excited, sad, happy, suprised, in short, I was on the edge of chair whole movie. At the end, I think there wont be another movie I would look like this, 'Kimi no Na wa.' will take special place in my heart, as from my begin of watching anime. Animes took special place in my life, and ' Kimi no Na wa.' will take special place among them  all. I hope you all enjoy this anime and many other.

                There's a lot of shows and movies nowadays that try to be ambitious -- and who can blame them, when they've got the rest of the world to compete with?
But then every once in a while, there's movies like this. Kimi no Na wa doesn't try to be ambitious. It just is. It's beautiful in its simplicity, and it proves that ordinary premises don't always turn into an unwatchable cliche. Instead, they can turn into something that resonates with us.
Don't get me wrong. This movie will not change your philosophy, your life, or whatever. But I do think it has tremendous ability to make you
                  *feel things*. And honestly, that's all it takes to make a great story.
**Story**: 9/10
Again, the premise isn't anything ground-breaking, but the writing is strong enough to carry it. It's funny at the right moments, sincere and even heartbreaking when the story calls for it. The writing is very subtle, which makes for good replay-ability, but it also knows when to be explicit.
**Art**/**Sound**: 10/10
Absolutely stunning, and definitely one of the things that really make the movie. I know there's a leaked version of it running around, but do be patient, and don't do the animators *and* yourself a disservice by watching a crappy 480p video of it just because you want to watch it now.
The same goes for the sound. I am happy they didn't do any orchestral, epic pieces or whatever. The simplicity of the music suits the tone of the movie, and definitely enhances it as well.
**Character**: 10/10
None of the characters are larger than life. It suits the movie, I think. The premise obviously isn't something realistic, but the characters have enough dimensions, and feel human enough that it is still very easy to empathise with their lives.
**Enjoyment**: 10/10

I do not think this anime is the best thing ever, in fact i think its honestly very mediocre and underwhelming. About halfway through i accidentally fell asleep for about 15 minutes and missed some stuff, i didn't rewatch what i missed and still understood the plot (I think). But when i woke up there was like fireworks or something. So i was pretty invested because fireworks are cool, but then they all just fucking died???? (i think that happened, or maybe i dreamt it when i fell asleep) idk it was pretty boring tho. The animation was good i guess but
                  i don't really care about animation. Uhhhhh... The character designs are pretty weird (i think the guy had a fat friend, and i like that because i'm kinda fat too). The voice acting was okay too. (they yell a lot) I like how they have a meteor because it reminds me of fortnite season 3 and that's cool. I also like how the main characters name is Taki because it reminds me of the chip Takis. (I don't like Takis but my friend does so thats cool.) Anyway that's my review for your name.

                I watched this movie in LA when it was participating for Best Critical animated movie, i really loved the story and fell in love with the main characters and recently Makoto said that the movie is a disasted because it was an unfinished project, but this isn't a reason why you wouldn't watch it, you will definetly love every single moment of it and wished for another movie. The art, story and characters were the best things in the movie with an realistic but also animated backgrounds and intresting love story with both the main characters Taki and Mitsuha's life.

                 What can I say that hasn't been said already but I just felt the need to put my take on 'Kimi no Na wa' because I felt the movie was too good for me not to leave a review and this sentiment was increased after rewatching Kimi no Na wa and I will be listing the Pros and cons of this movie.
Pros: 
-Animation good enough to be classified as Eye candy
- A soundtrack that makes you lose yourself in your imagination and is always played during appropriate scenes
- Lastly it made me not only fall in love with the idea of love but also
                  reminded me as to why I enjoy/love anime so much because it was truly a worthwhile experience in the form of a movie.
Cons: 
- The only negative thing I can say about this masterpiece is that I wish it was a series instead of a movie and it's not because I don't enjoy movies, but simply because I would have liked to have had the chance to enjoy or see more of Kimi no Na wa mainly to have the characters and story be fleshed out more along the way and also being able to constantly be memorized with amazing animation accompanied with good music to back it up.

                Probably the best anime movie I've ever watched. I highly recommend watching it if you are still a newbie. Both the story and the characters are awesome and I really enjoy the soundtrack since it has deep connection to the entire story.
From the beginning until the end the anime is so beautifully designed as if I was immersed into the story and emotions. You will find lots of funny, sad moments in it, and the ending was also amazing. Overall it was a masterpiece.

                I came into this anime with high expectations after already seeing very high ratings from this website...and I was certainly not disappointed! 
One of the things that stuck out the most was the incredible animation. Even a scene involving just cutting a tomato was so beautiful! It felt stunningly unique yet incredibly familiar at the same time. 
Furthermore, the story kept reeling me in throughout with multiple mini plot twists and an incredibly romantic story. It was so compelling and painfully bittersweet. 
The characters maybe lacked a small amount of depth, but for an anime lasting under 2 hours, this is understandable. Despite this, they
                  were fun and humorous.

                This is my first Review, so please be gentle Senpai!
(Before the real review i want to tell you something i think it's important)
When i first heard of this anime i didn't understand why it was so much loved.
I watched the trailer, i read the reviews, i talked with my friends but in the end i got to the conclusion that i needed to watch it before everything.
God i've never been this right in my entire life.
The Story
There is one thing that i really appreciate about this anime: 
the ""characterization"" of the story, and i know that it's sounds strange but i can explain myself. Most
                  of the animes and films i've seen spend a lot of time introducing the character or giving them a lot of backstory, in short words: ""Giving them something that leaves a mark to the public"".
Kimi no na wa tries to work less on the characters (That doesn't mean they are bad) and more on the story about the boy and the girl understanding each other.
While i was watching the movie i felt like i was there, i felt like i was the story of these two amazing characters. And in the meanwhile the story was giving me something important to understand, something that i've never felt this strong, Happiness itself.
I really want to be objective but i can't, i've watched it two times and i nearly cried two times.
The Art
This time i'm going to be short, not because the art isn't good, but because i'm not good in these type of things (Sorry if i say something really stupid).
The illustration was gold and it got me stuck to the screen so much that sometimes i wasn't even blinking. Sometimes the ""camera"" wasn't in the best angle but that's something i noticed only the 2nd time i watched it.
The Sound
The music, the background sounds, the voices, that's another thing that i really loved.
I'm going to add ALL the music in my playlist and i'm going to listen to it until i die.
No seriously, i'm not joking.
The Characters
Mitsuha Miyamizu is one of the best characters i've ever seen, her voice, her attitude, her face and even her acting. I really loved her, and it's now one of my favorites.
Taki Tachibana i don't like him so much but i can tell that his being shy and kind is something that you can appreciate, but that's not my type of male character.
The secondary characters aren't really useful or good designed but i can understand why. I think they're not good but they're helpful to the story and to the feelings that the anime wants to leave you.
I really loved this anime and if it's in my powers to say it (Not that i care), i think this is one of the best films and animes i've seen in the last years, it's going to be difficult for the others now.
P.S. I think that reviews must be objective but if you don't tell something more what distinguish a Review from a Synopsis?",10,Khai

                Kimi no Na wa can stole people heart except people who can't understand an art.

I give bold 10/10 for this movie
The story is very intersting that can incomporating Drama with the Culture elements, Fantasy, History, Geograpical phenomenon, And space and time.
Kimi no Na wa will feel a little bit confused if you can't understand the story from the first starting scene, So this movie need a huge focus when being watched.
There is no even a little doubt for the art. Is's Look very realistic on the grapic and visual.
Every theme song feels so right with this movie, The song and
                  the scene is run in rhythm that can get an emotional feeling more much.
Do not know why but Taki characters is not good enough for me, i rather Mitsuha characters more suitable.
I am entirely enjoy Kimi no Na wa, i can watching it for fewtimes and not bored. The Story can sting to the deepest heart.
Overall, Kimi No na Wa is so far from disappointment i mean it.

I know you will think that it is kind of generous when to give 10/10 but this anime deserves it. Nobody is perfect but this is so far the nearest to be a perfect anime. 
Story. It strikes me with an interesting plot where 2 different persons switch places and do their daily life as another person.
Art. The art is was VERY BEAUTIFUL very very beautiful. It is like a painting that can bring happiness same as heartwarming feeling to our hearts. The art express how humans really should be grateful about their surroundings because everyone has their own perspective.
Sounds. The background music always fit with the current scenes. It also uplift emotions. it strikes me with ""You can be happy, but look around you and you should be grateful!"" which always makes me emotional. 
The only bad thing by watching it for the first time.
The story about how they are changing places and how they act as another person is kinda rush and also after the 3/4 of the story I felt a distance between the character's friends and the main characters. I never felt so lonely before.
Conclusion: There's always somebody out there see the world like yourself. That's thought this movie give me. A masterpiece on its own and very friendly movie with a mixed feelings. Very entertaining movie.
PS: I've been waiting for this kind of movie about switching bodies because I really like to compare what others think of another person based on their actions. What if I was him what will he think about her? what if I was her what would I think about him? something like that..

However Makoto Shinkai wanted the film to be entertaining and something that people would enjoy. The plot holes were never a issue to me.

Art 10/10 - Makoto Shinkai's work has always been the best, close to
                  realistic drawings in fact he has been drawing his own animations since he got a MAC PC, on his early days. Now he has a whole team thus, this masterpiece.
Sound 10/10 - I play the piano, quite fairly well I consider myself well versed when it comes to music. Every inch of the piano, of the vocals is it all TIMED PERFECTLY.
Character 10/10 - No cringe, no bullshit characters,  if you were at that age you'd understand what I mean. 
Enjoyment 10/10 - Watch this. You'll enjoy it take my word for it.
OVERALL - 10/10 - its a MASTERPIECE.",10,Sena12

                Such a beautiful film with a beautiful journey. Was definitely a film that once I started watching it, I didn't want to stop. 
I loved watching the character development, as it was so different to anything that I had seen. 
It was raw, emotional, and beautiful. There were moments where I was metaphorically gripping my seat, moments where I was rooting for the characters, and moments where I felt so sad for what the characters were going through.
Definitely one of my top anime films, if not, the top anime film for me, and for the person who showed it to me too, which is definitely
                  one of the best of the many great films they have exposed me and introduced me to.",10,Mili_Mil_Mils

                Why are you here reading reviews? Go watch the movie for crying out loud! It's definitely worth your time ;)
Apparently I can't write a review that short dang it.
Well if there's something I have to say it's that this movie is amazing. I have watched this movie countless times and it manages to make me tense every time I see it (and sometimes even cry :P) and it is never boring despite the fact I might be on my 367th rewatch!
Aside from just entertainment this is a work of art. The animation and shadows and textures are beautiful and one scene in particular (I won't
                  mention which for obvious reasons) just blew my mind. The dialogue is on point and although the voice acting is a bit bland at times it still really hits home on most occasions. The soundtrack is amazing (as expected) and everything is really well thought out.
The story is genius the characters are well-textured and the main ones' subtle romance (except for one scene) is heart-warming and the themes explored are unique and creative and UUUGGGGHHHHH I can't get over how brilliant this movie is!
I won't say more so as not to spoil anything but trust me when I say you will NOT be disappointed!

                Everytime I finish watching a Shinkai's movie i feel like punching him. WHy? Because, even if his stories have a lot of character development and a very well done melancholy tone, they always have vague or REALLY sad endings. ANd ok, it is ""unprofessional"" from me to say this but i am just a commoner, i feel like i need to say that.
THis movie did not slap me in the face like most of his movies, and i really felt like rooting for the main couple. I could feel the feeling of despair whenever they were afraid to forget each other. I liked how it
                  started simple and funny, and then it got a lot more dramatic.
I am always looking for good romances in anime, and most of the time i find it, but there is always something missing, and this movie does NOT have this.
I don't feel like punching SHinkai, i feel like giving him a hug and saying ""Thanks""",10,Xavier_Xavier

                People going into this kind of stuff might think that the number one spot is undeserving but I disagree wholeheartedly. Thing is, this movie is not perfect and that's true, you can deduct points here and there, but that's not what counts. An overall experience is what matters. Studio Ghibli movies are not perfect either but the overall experience is amazing. 
I went into this movie with a lot of expectations, thinking I'll be disappointed because I was merely too hyped for it. Oh, I was wrong. 
The movie simply transcends everything I've seen in the last few years. 
Is it perfect? No.

                Kimi no Na wa (Your Name) is a masterpiece of an animated movie that deserves its fame. Makoto Shinkai’s work never ceases to amaze me.
Story: 8
Art: 9
Sound: 10
Character: 9
Enjoyment: 10
Overall: 10
Story:Your Name portrays the story well. The only issue I have with it is that its very overused. Many romance movies have 2 people that have an obstacle that they try to overcome. The movie didn't bring much new to the table. The story also felt rushed in the end. We didn’t get to know the main/supporting characters better which is a bad thing overall. It still turned out decently well in the end, however.
Art:
Your Name has beautiful art. Similar to my previous criticism however, it doesn't bring anything new. If you were to show this anime to someone without any context, they probably would think it was an anime. It's unclear on what the exact budget for the anime was, but it was most likely a low one. However, it does look like it took a lot of time, effort, and love to create, and I applaud them for it.
Sound:
Sound is an important factor to a good anime/movie. Sure, it isn't as important as the art and story, but without it, the anime/movie seems very lifeless. Your Name thankfully provides the movie with stunning music. It’s executed at the perfect moment and makes the movie more emotional. The music is very calming and I suggest you listen to it. Alongside the music, there is the voice acting. I watched the movie dub where they did do a good job. The emotions were shown through the voice acting. Compared to some other anime, they did overall a good job.
Character:
The main characters, Taki Tachibana and Mitsuha Miyamizu, are good examples of what characters in anime should be. Why? They are relatable characters to many people. Both characters go to high school and wish to leave to somewhere better. Relatable characters are important to any show to really hook the audience. This story did that well. However, there were some issues with the characters. The main characters should have really focused on some of the small aspects when they switched. If this did happen to you, you would most likely worry more than think about them. 
Overall:
This is one of my favorite movies for the reasons stated above. It has some flaws, but the best parts of the movie make it shine. This movie has opened me up to other good movies from Makoto Shinkai (director of Your Name) like 5 Centimeters Per Second. This movie deserves all of the popularity it has on MAL. Overall, if you are thinking if you should really watch this, please do. You will be happy when you finish it.",10,Darielquinta

                Is it lame and cliche to give this a 10/10? Probably. Gonna do it anyway.
My brother recommended this movie to me while I was making him watch all of Naruto with me. He seemed really smug about the idea of introducing me to ""good"" anime. He wasn't wrong, when compared to the average shounen fight anime there's so much more that this movie has to offer. Honestly it's one that I recommend to people now if ever they have questions about what anime to watch. It would be a great way to introduce people to the medium if it didn't start with a boob joke.
Now
                  a cultured man like me? I find genderbent highschoolers groping their own chest to be the height of comedy and dare I say art. But to someone who's new to all this it can be really off-putting and it makes it really hard for me to want to recommend this to everyone. But I'm just trying to find nitpicked because I love this movie so much I can't really think of anything else wrong with it.
You have two kids meeting in very unusually circumstances and slowly growing feelings for each other. You have non-linear storytelling due to some time travel shenanigans. You have dramatic reveals, tense situations, a race against the clock and a resolution that makes me tear up a little every time. This movie was so damn good that Hollywood movie studios even took notice and are going to try their own adaptation. It's going to be a dumpster fire but I will probably still watch it because I can't get enough of this story. Good romance, unique premise, amazing ending. 10/10",10,lamaraptor

                An Honest Review
Story - 8
This animation film is a easy watcher. Anyone of any age and experience in anime can watch this and be happy at the end. Story gets a 8 because how it only revolves around just the comet and Mitsuha. Of course, Taki is part of show but he more a supporting main, in my opinion. Mitsuha was the main focus, and don't get me wrong, she wanted to live in the city and Taki was just her savior to get to that goal. Yes, both fell in love with each other, but come on she was three year older than him
                  and both characters knew that.
Art - 9
I appraise the scene when the comet was flying really low (Mitsuha perspective) and it was ""scattering"" ""rippling"" ""streaking"" (IDK what it was doing actually, but it looked awesome and unique). All the other the scene fair against the trending anime, the color management is much more vibrant and more aesthetic (pleasing to the eyes).
Sound - 9
Nothing to be said here. It is great. Thanks RADWIMPS.
Character - 9
Story may be a 8, but character gets a 9. Taki learn the situation linearly, but then exponentially (probably due to the time constraint of two hours). Anyway, we learn both character quite well and do want to have both character to fall in love with each other. At the end of the show was the main bummer for most, but I think it is perfectly fine. 
""WTF????? WHY DID BOTH CHARACTER DECIDES TO WALK AWAY?"" they said.
Here's why:
I would had said the same thing IF both character were at the same age and had the same interest. Mitsuha's interest was to become a city girl. Taki's interest was to save Mitsuha and be a savior. Also, as I said before, both characters weren't in the same age. Mitsuha was older than Taki. What would your friends would had said if they saw you dating a woman 3 years older than you. I don't think they would think cleanly of you, they probably be more like, ""this guy trying to get some old p*ssy?"" 
No offense but that is modern world we currently live in.
Enjoyment - 9
It's great and easy to watch. That's the reason why it is ranked number #2 in MAL and highly praised for.
Overall - 9
The stories could had made some changes, but overall the animation film was a great story teller. Easy to watch, calming, and you need no experience in anime. Just note that there's is light anime cliche, but don't let this bum you out because the cliche can be funny in this anime.
Want a great picture but without anime character in it? This show can get you one, you just have to search it on Google of when the comet was flying past the characters.",9,craPy_creATIon

                Here’s a very unpopular opinion and that is I am not the biggest fan of Makoto Shinkai. Do, I think he is great anime director who deserves all the love and respect he gets? Absolutely! But, his movies have never struck a chord with me- and the only one that I thought was at least good was 5cm/s. He never with his films , have left me in a state of awe like Hosoda, Miyazaki or Satoshi Kon did. But, did that change with Kimi Ni No Wa- his latest movie that is currently taking over the box office in Japan? Well we will find
                  out today!
Kimi Ni Na Wa, or Your Name is a sc fi, romance, drama movie about a village girl named Mitsuha and a boy from Tokyo named Taki- who on a daily basis end up switching bodies. Not only does this strange incident  affect their normal lives- but it also leads to the two having feelings for each other. 
Now, from the premise alone- you might assume this movie might not have anything new to offer. It sounds like your typical body switching romance movie-but along with that you can expect all that gorgeous animation and melodrama present in Shinkai films. But, no that couldn’t be further from the truth. This movie was surprisingly very creative, and the execution of this body switching trope was handled brilliantly. This film isn’t going in the direction you think it’s heading and ends up being pretty unpredictable- despite all the hints that are scattered in the movie. 
My only issue with the story would be that sometimes it got a bit confusing- especially when they constantly swapped bodies. Not to mention, regarding the fantasy elements of the movie- which being unique for the most part, kinda left me being clueless. But, by the end it isn’t hard to put all the puzzle pieces together. I believe that maybe a bit but not too much of exposition could have helped clear some of the confusion.
Other than the story, the characters too are praise-worthy. The main female protagonist, Mitsuha is very likeable and the movie does a good job of presenting her life, her family and friends. Hence, she feels like an actual person you can relate too.I found that very impressive and a nice addition to this movie. She wants to escape her mundane life and no longer deal with her father’s bullshit, and you want to root for her. Taki, too despite being your average teenager- is another very lovable character. He too has a great personality, and is very determined and strong. Also, the fact he can’t stopping touching Mitsuha’s boobs when being in her body- was quite a hilarious gag too. The friend characters of both Taki and especially Mitsuha were very relevant to the story as well, and also likeable. 
We get see things from both of their perspectives, so it actually feels like they are both important to the story. But, we too the audience get a very good glimpse of both of their lives- and hence making us very well acquainted with the two and the people around them.
The romance too, despite not being the main focus was handled well. The two had a great bond, and they understood each other very well. They suit each perfectly, and you wish you got to see more moments of these two together. Like, these two are OTP!
Given it’s a Shinkai film, saying the animation is excellent would be an understatement. However, the animation despite being beautiful and breath-taking- this time around doesn’t try to be the star of the show. In most Shinkai films, I get a feeling that the animation is trying to be more memorable than the story and the characters. However, this isn’t the case now, because this movie isn’t just about showing off its outstanding visuals. The character designs are really great too, and much better than his previous works. There was this one sequence in the middle of the movie, that had water colour/pastel affect to it, that was so mesmerizing that it made my heart race. 
The voice acting for this movie is highly impressive as both the seiyuus-portraying the two leads did a great job bringing the characters to life. In fact, listening to them speak during the emotional moments, can get anyone teary eyed. 
Overall, Kimi Ni Na Wa not only lived up to my expectations, but exceeded them. Not only are the characters very lovable, but the story too has way more to offer than you think it does- with interesting twists and turns along the way. It can get very emotional, with a great build up to the climax and an ending very fitting for this movie. This movie is not only my favourite Makoto Shinkai film, but one of my favourite anime films in general. He finally managed to leave me in awe, given how not a single moment was dull, not to mention, I was thoroughly engaged and enchanted while watching this movie.
Hence,  Kimi Ni No Wa or  Your Name gets a very well deserved 10 out of 10 and that it’s a MUST WATCH. Shinkai hits a homerun with this movie and I will be looking forward to his future projects. Now, I expect nothing but the best for him, and if he continues making movies brimming with so much creativity and relatable characters- then he too will end up being one of my favourite anime directors.",10,pandamon514

                [WARNING:MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD, I WOULD RECOMMEND WATCHING THE MOVIE FIRST BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW]
Kimi no na wa. An anime movie claimed to be one of the best anime movies of 2016 and in all anime in general. It is the 9th highest rated anime on MAL, so it definitely shows, and it wouldn't be possible without one of the best anime directors, Makoto Shinkai. Surprising I never watched Your name, whilst knowing the massive praise it received over the years, up until yesterday. Just like his previous works, Kimi no na wa exceeded expectations by a lot of people, and I can definitely (sort of)
                  see why (to an extent). This is going to be my longest review since compared to the other anime I made reviews on, this one is different, and please forgive me if I get any facts wrong while I'm here.
Story 7/10: Of course the main foundation of successful animes is of course the story (it depends on the genre of course but that's a story for another day). Unfortunately, because of it's high praise, I had my hopes a bit too high (and dont worry this isn't a negative review). The concept is fairly simple. It focuses around the main characters Taki and Mitsuha who are both in their youth for 95% of the movie. Suddenly a strange phenomenon randomly occurs and it causes the main characters to switch bodies. After moments of Taki and Mitsuha finding out the truth behind Mitsuha's town, they try to stop a meteor from annihilating the town. This concept was really interesting and it kind of made me excited to continue watching this movie, however, there was a factor that had a significant impact on my thoughs of the movie was the story structure. Let me mention one thing, this type of story structure is different. Kimi no na wa doesnt have your typical story writing to like seeing in your favourite shounen/shoujo, if that's the case the reason I was disappointed in the story was because the story structure was different? No, it's pretty natural for me to feel mixed about ""new"" things and it's fine as long as you put some thought into them, and that's what I did. This movie has a very messy story structur, it feels inconsistent, and it leaves a few plot holes open. 
What is this strange phenomenon that is responsible for the switching bodies incident? Why is Mitsuha and her 2 friends still alive after we saw the meteor crush the town near the end of the movie? Ok you could argue about what happened for the 2nd point, but plot holes such as those still had me mixed about the story and more overly the praise it received. Is it bad that it di5achieve on answering those questions and leaving plot holes open? Not particularly, I think of the strange phenomenon as a plot device in order for the story to move forward (which reminds me of the ability the MC from Erased had, it was never explained nor mentioned, but without it we most likely wouldn't had Erased ever happen. Additionally, because of how time events were structured, i didn't feel emotional about the characters actions, which is a thing I was highly expecting to feel about. I think it over did it on this section, but what I'm trying to say is that while it's not bad, the story could've been done much better.
Art 10/10: Of course I have to give this section a 10/10. Shinkais works are also known for their breathtaking art and animation and I completely agree with them. I dont really have much to say since it's a pretty repetitive point, but I will say that Kimi no na wa has one of the best animations of all time and if you're a sucker for breathtaking art in anime or art in general, Kimi no na wa is an absolute must watch.
Sound 9/10: Of course I cant forget about the music either. I particularly really enjoyed the music and Shinkai did an absolutely amazing job with implementing music to certain scenes to reinforce  the impact of the specific scene and it was nicely utilized to convey emotion into the main characters and their situation. For the main themes we have RADWIMPS for the performance/composition, these themes I think are more towards to the rock music, since the band also plays rock music, it might sound a bit worrying because of the type of story we are introduced, but that's not the case, I particularly liked the fact that some of the music were rock because it emphasized on the main characters youth, and it would probably make you reflect on your school life and the times you had spent with your friends, and I was really pleased to get this feeling from the music, and that's coming from someone who enjoys music in general, so keep an eye for the amazing soundtracks that will bless your ears with joy.
Characters 7/10: This is also one of the weakest points of the movie. To first start with the Pros, the characters are nowhere near to bad characters, I actually quite enjoyed them interacting with each other, which furthermore made the movie more delightful to watch, and I liked how the side characters, even though they weren't important, expressed care towards the main characters and it made me cogitate on the fact that not all characters need to have a great character development to be considered ""good"" characters. Now with the cons, and this reflects towards the main characters and it corresponds with the last point stated on the story, specifically how time events were utilized. To explain it simply, the movie gives 20 minutes at the start to introduce to the characters and their relationship state, as well as their in the world. I wont complain too much about this point since it's a movie but the characters and relationships felt rushed. They didnt feel like they had enough development (I'm currently referring to Taki and Mitsuha) for me to care about their backstories and their motives. It made me feel that the main characters lacked motivation and it made me question why they cared so much about each other at that high level of ""love"", even though it's not something I like thinking about, thus just like the story, I didnt feel really emotional towards both main characters to most extent (I quite understood why Taki felt desperate about Mitsuhas death  but the way Shinkai portrayed it with the time events didn't quite help.
Overall 8/10: In conclusion, did Kimi no na wa exceed my expectations like million of anime fans? Maybe to an extent, with the conveyance of animation and music creating a further impact on the story, however, the story and characters suffered in exchange, and to clarify, I dont hate the story and characters, in all actuality it's the opposite, but it couldn't definitely be done better if they had more time. So to be honest I do understand where the praise is coming from. It's a unique story compared to the generic shounen and isekais Japan has been feeding us with. If you want to experience a completely different story, make sure to check it out. If you're not particularly a fan of confusing narratives, then watch it but dont get your hopes too high.",8,Mati_Boi

                When someone described Your Name to me as ‘sort of like Freaky Friday,’ telling you I was skeptical is an understatement.  I hadn’t heard anything about it, and I briefly confused it with Koe no Katachi (A Silent Voice), which was being discussed a lot at the time for some reason. After that I decided F It I'm watching this thing and now I'm gonna review it!!!!
SO YOU'RE HERE!!!! I'M HERE!!!! LETS DO THIS!!!!!
The movie is centered around two high school students, Mitsuha and Taki.  Mitsuha is from a rural town in the mountains, where she, her younger sister, and their grandmother take
                  care of the shrine.  Taki, however, lives in Tokyo with his father and works part-time a restaurant.  Mitsuha has become bored of the lackluster country life in her town, and her wish for something more exciting is granted when she wakes up one day in Taki’s body.
What follows is a hysterical few weeks when, after missing memories and their friends filling them in on the days they can’t remember, they finally discover what’s happening: the two have somehow been switching bodies.
They first figure out a way to communicate, typically through notes on their cell phones or writing on the other person’s hands or arms.  They bicker constantly, and sometimes meddle in each other’s lives, like when Mitsuha gets Taki a date with his coworker/crush Miki Okudera.
I’ll leave you to see the rest for yourself.  It’s brilliant, heartbreaking, and honestly, one of the best movies I’ve ever seen.  Unsurprisingly, it was the highest-grossing movie in Japan in 2016, and the highest-grossing anime movie worldwide.  Ever.
Your Name is poetic in its own way, witty, and beyond stunning in its artwork.  Truthfully, I couldn’t see how many of the scenes would have the same impact if they were rendered in anything other than animation.  Not to mention, the English dub is actually not that bad (Though I prefer the Japanese dub)
Something to be thankful for with this film is the lack of some messy explanation as to why the body-switching started.  The audience is brought in right after Taki first wakes up in Mitsuha’s body, and I never found myself wanting more info on that phenomenon.  I was way more enthralled by the happenings later in the movie, which I believe was the intention.  Something else is the way in which the movie touches upon the aspect of cross-gender body-swapping.  It’s hilarious and curious without being crude or cliche.
If I had to pick at anything at all, it would be the the minimal character development and the rushed montages.  The sped-up scenes plow through the beginnings of their romance, and while still powerful in the end, the strength of Taki and Mitsuha’s bond isn’t felt as much until later.  We see a slight change in Taki, who becomes less hotheaded, but as for Mitsuha, her character has less time to grow as she’s missing for a good chunk of the last half of the movie.
Verdict: Kimi No Na Wa (Your Name) is one of the if not the greatest anime movies ever made. It has one of the best and most unique stories ever, Great characters, A fantastic director, Awesome Animations and Heartwarming Music and it was a absolutely shame that the movie wasn't even nominated for the Oscars.
And also Makoto Shinkai...... You Beauty!

                Short review: Just watch it. Its just a movie so if you don't like it you wont waste much time.
Long Review: Kimi no Na wa or Your name in English is the best anime movie I have seen so far. Everything about it got me so invested in what was going on. First of all the story was way better than I thought it would be. I went in thinking it was going to be a average romance movie, but oh was I wrong. I should have known I was going to be wrong since a regular romance movie wouldn't make the money this movie
                  made. I'm not gonna reveal much about the story just go watch and witness the great story for yourself. Now the art. Oh the art. The art is probably my favorite thing about this anime. If you don't watch it for the story or characters you could watch it for the art alone. It is just so pleasing to look at this movie. I didn't spot I single bad moment in the animation. It is truly a beautiful anime. On to the sound. Now I never really pay attention to the sound much in anime (aside from the openings). But if you do pay attention to sound a lot I don't think you will find anything wrong with it. The music at the end and beginning however I did very much enjoy. The characters were very memorable for me. I find it hard to get attached to movie characters since you have so little time to get to know them. However I didn't have any problem getting attached to these characters they are so likable, and pretty relatable. Now for my enjoyment. I very much enjoyed it. I don't know why but I've always had problems just sitting down and watching movies by myself. I had zero problems doing that with this movie. So overall just watch it. It is worth your time. Even if you don't like it just watch it to say you have. Its a pretty amazing anime to add to your list.",9,Doctor_Ghost

                So I just had the pleasure of enjoying “Your Name” in the cinema and though I could share some thoughts.
I’ve seen many movies trying to pull off the “two people mysteriously change body with one another”, but I’ve never seen a movie doing a good job with it.
Until now, that is. Makoto Shinkai’s “Your Name (Kimi no na wa)” has finally succeeded at the task. With a very well deserved rating of 8.6 and 113th placing on the list of 250 top rated movies of all time, “Your Name” delivers us anything we could ask from it:
A terrific artwork, the movie’s animation is extremely well
                  made, with beautiful landscape scenes accompanied with an excellent soundtrack; the sky, sun, water and comets are completely astonishing and mesmerising to watch. There is even a psychedelic like animation scene halfway through the movie during a critical moment that is deeply touching.
Just like in every of Mokoto’s movies, the characters are extremely well constructed and it makes you fall in love with them after 10 minutes into the movie, developing a huge emotional bound to the story.
The movie had a perfect balance of everything: comedy (which isn't always present on Makoto Shinkai movies, so it was quite pleasant to see it in this one) drama, romance, some mystery, all with a touch of non-linear movie structure. It’s the type of movie that will make you laugh, cry, laugh while crying…
The movie’s perspective constantly changes between the two main characters, what gave it a very touch and it’s not something you see very often.
For every anime fan this movie is definitely a must watch, and even for non anime fans I’do recommend to give it a try!",10,Luan_Gardenalli

                When I started watching this movie, I did not know what to expect.  Due to the fact I rarely watch movies and this wasn't the typical kind of movie I would watch anyways.  But the further into the movie I got, the more I yearned for the characters and what they wanted.  Honestly I won't say this about many movies, or even TV shows, but by the end of this movie I was sincerely bawling my eyes out and could not stop for a good thirty minutes after I was done watching it.  And it was not the bad kind of
                  crying either where your favorite character dies in the TV show you were watching, but the heart wrenching tears of joy that were running down my cheeks.

                Amazing. Breath-taking. Resonating. 
These 3 words are the essence of Your Name. Written and directed by Makoto Shinkai, Kimi No Na Wa, or Your Name in English, is the masterfully crafted story of a body-swapping teenage boy and girl who develop a deep connection that transcends both time and space. This film grips you from the very beginning and never lets you go through the whirlwind of emotions it sends its audience on throughout its runtime. Beautiful animation, stunning visuals, compelling characters, and a perfectly braided storyline keep the viewer intensely engaged throughout this wonderful work of art. 
The structure of the storyline in this
                  film is incredibly clever. It's always ahead of the viewers and takes sharp turns at the most unexpected moments to keep things unpredictable. I was constantly at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen to Taki and Mitsuha, the two protagonists, next and how they would overcome the grandiose obstacles put in front of them both physically and emotionally. But what is perhaps even more impressive than that is how Taki and Mitsuha's character arcs unfold and how the thread connecting their destinies is unraveled to deliver a devastatingly phenomenal narrative. The strong themes of love, destiny, longing, and separation are immensely powerful, relatable, and leave you emotionally vulnerable and engrossed throughout this exceptional story.
This powerful and poignant narrative is further bolstered by the film's great sound design and visuals. In terms of visuals, Shinkai's extravagant and astonishing artistry is present here in abundance as evident by the stunning characters and the extraordinary backgrounds which leave an excellent impression on the audience. The visceral drawings and ethereal art style bring you to this almost-illusory place which perfectly absorbs you into the setting and lays the groundwork for this fantastical world that exists within a familiar reality. In terms of sheer visual beauty and the effectiveness of it, this is arguably his most magnificent work thus far. Every shot is pristine and memorable. The amazing soundtrack, created specifically for this film by RADWIMPS, perfectly encapsulates every moment and every emotion you feel and even further adds to the emotional impact and beauty of Your Name. It complements the stunning visuals and dream-like tones to bring the emotional climaxes above and even further beyond. The score manages to be deeply memorable and touching with such simple melodies and so few instruments. Every time I hear the gentle piano of Katawaredoki or Theme of Mitsuha, my heart aches a little, as if I'm feeling this sense of yearning and emptiness just as Taki and Mitsuha are. 
Your Name is one of those films where you can't help but lose yourself in the story and become emotionally invested in the characters. Your jaw drops in awe when you experience its beautiful artwork and you become overwhelmed by this feeling of grief or longing when you hear the chilling soundtrack. This is a film that genuinely speaks to your heart. In creating Your Name, Makoto Shinkai has truly constructed a masterpiece that is absolutely beautiful in all aspects from the intricately crafted story with well-written and fully-realized characters to the tremendous visuals and animation. The brilliant final encounter is perfectly-crafted giving the viewer much-needed closure and a meaningful ending to this heart-wrenching and remarkable tale. In the end, I was left covered in tears and immediately after the credits rolled, I wanted to watch the film again, and again after that, and so on - a testament to the heartbreaking beauty and emotional resonance of Your Name.",10,Kishan98

                To say the truth, this movie is my first best anime based movie I ever watched. The story is magnificent and the way of a little isekai type of story perfectly scored it. Even though I watched some romance genre anime, this movie ranked in the top 3 of my romance genre anime. The way the story from hating each other until the climax where something happened and they..... (not gonna spoil it) then they met each other again in the end, is not like all those typical romance genre anime. The uniqueness put me in a state of awe! But sadly this anime is
                  not ranked first in all the anime I watched. I have seen better masterpiece than this anime but still, 君の名は。strikes my heart so deep that I cried from sadness to happiness. Shinkai Makoto never fails the audience expectation in fact, he makes the audience gets the unexpected. That's is why I chose the best mark for the overall performance. I hope that you guys has a feeling same like me and write your opinion about this movie. That's all from me and hope you guys wont disappoint on my rating.",10,KUROYUKI_KAGEYA

Review made by a french speaker, I hope it's okay !
How do I have to watch something ?  It's the most existential question that I could ask to myself, because, I will never find an answer. 
Here, we can see this movie in three way : for it's beauty, for it's story/originality or for it's staging.  If you watch juste for the beauty of the movie and the little existence of the plot line, well, this movie is fabulous !  If you watch for the staging, it's okay, near perfect.  If you watch for some uniqueness, originality or story....well, better watch
                  for the beauty of the sceneries...
Story :
Plote hole, stupidity, cliche, cliche and one panty shot somewhere in the forest. The idea is something déjà-vu, but is always interesting.  By how the two protagonist try to live with each other, that was fantastic.  But, the movie is in three part : 1. Slice of life comedy 2. Beginning of the story, interesting, but cliche use of ideas. 3. Well shit.
The beginning promises many interesting things like politics or religion/mythology criticism, but nothing got really detailed like every other work of Makoto Shinkai (I'm looking at you The Place Promised In Our Early Days).  Urgh !  That trap that promises intersting things for nothing always got me ! Well, if you are okay with deja-vu story, again and again, I think it's possible to like it.  One thing is sure, the staging is beautiful and some ideas have the merit to exist, nothing less, nothing more
Animation:
Eveyrthin is top notch, perfect, beautiful, in every sens of the word.  Really, not many thing to say.  If I could, I would say that there is not enough of onirism, what is shaping every work of Makoto (principally the snow and the metal).  Here, everything is just beautiful, there is not really something unique, and that's pretty sad knowing the director.
Sound :
Nothing exceptionnal, nothing original, nothing bad, so well, it's okay.  The voice acting is pretty good.  One complaint is the four singing song in the entire movie that seems more like a big advertising for some album than a piece of the movie.  It's wearisome. But everything else is really good.
Characters :
One thing that I hate in every movie of Makoto is how every character are the same.  The protagonist are always clones of some cliche and the women are always stupid for some cuteness...  Place Promised was just monstruous !  Here, the author tried to work with the two protagonist at the same time, and that was a pretty good idea.  But, well, cliche still here.  Why change when everybody love this ?  It's simple and efficient.  But, it's BAD ! 
Overall :
A good and bad movie.  If you are searching for some entertainment, well it's near perfect and I understand the hype for it.  If you are searching for some romance... well, it's okay, I guess ?  Go watch 5 Centimeters insted (cliche too, but better feeling, more unique because of the winter).  If you are searching for something not just good, but original, you will want to cry.  This is hard to give a grade, because it's one of this popular thing that is neither bad, good or between the two.  It's perfect for entertainment and fast romance emotion.  But for some second tought, this movie is really bad. Nothing unique. I had a good time watching it and I liked it, but, oh well. It's sad, because, it's soooo beautiful !",6,Ikitsune8

                SPOILER-FREE REVIEW!
I... loved this movie! Honestly the only other anime movie I had seen before this was ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" by Hayao Miyazaki over at Studio Ghibli, which I watched in a movie theater a couple years ago. That being said, this movie far exceeded my expectations and hopes, which is bound to happen when stories are made through the versatile medium of anime.
I fully enjoyed the dramatic romance between Mistuha and Taki, and the way that their dreams wove together so well. I appreciated the deep cultural attention that Mikoto Shinkai brought to the movie's rural setting, and the way he threaded the supernatural
                  and mystical elements into the tapestry of the film was as magical as the direction of the beautiful, flowing visuals and multi-dimensional sound (both background music and ambient sounds mixing together as undertones to everything the voice actors spoke).

                I honestly LOOOVVEE THIS ANIME!! I've watched it at least 5 times and have recommended it to so many friends and family and they all love it too. I even had to watch it in theaters when it came out in the US even thought it was my 3rd time. Lol.  There were a few times that triggered me, but it all brought together the story and I wouldn't have it any other way. This is my favorite anime and probably will be for a while. I hope the next film by Shinkai Makoto will be as great! 
The film made me so anxious
                  and excited all the way to the end. When I watched it for the second time with a friend, we both cried and were lying on the stairs, trying to gain back our senses from the emotional ride.",10,Bobateee

I can't think of another movie that I wanted to watch again immediately after finishing it. This is in part due to the enjoyment I had watching it, but also due to revelations that happen in the second half of the movie that made me want to see if I could notice things in the first half that I missed the first time.
The animation is gorgeous and I love the songs by Radwimps. I don't want to spoil anything,
                  so all I'll say about the story is that it took an unexpected turn from what I thought was going to be a basic long distance love story, and that made it so much better. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, whether they watch anime or not.",10,fredericouno

Furthermore the characters are well made in the setting, Mitsuha and Taki has a

                It should be illegal for us to have something this good.
Your Name is amazing.
Your Name will pull you in and make you forget about life for almost two weeks.
Your Name will make you weep like a little b*tch at numerous times during its runtime, and you will love it for it.
Your Name will restore your faith not just in anime, but in storytelling in general.
If you haven't seen Your Name yet, don't read anything more about it. Seriously, just find a way to watch it. Other reviews will spoil the fuck out of it, no apologies, and those bastard reviewers deserve to have their nuts
                  kicked in and their jackoff skulls cracked open. Ruining this movie without any warning should be a felony.
For those of you doubting retards who don't believe millions of people the world over (who love this film, and who have paid multiple times to see it), I'll give you the most basic of synopses now. I'll call the following short rundown spoiler territory though, since totally blind is the absolute best way to go into this film.
Slight Spoilers.
Your Name is about a high school girl named Mitsuha who lives in a remote mountain town. One morning she wakes up very confused with what she finds in the mirror. The next day she appears to be back to normal, but she has no recollection of what everybody around her claims she did the day before. She apparently forgot people's names, where she went to school, and who she herself was.
Mitsuha is discombobulated by everyone else's tales of her amnesiac adventures. Especially because all she can remember is a weird dream where she was in the body of a high school boy who lived in Tokyo. She had to go to this boy's school and pretend to be him during his studies, and then at his evening job as a waiter in an upscale Italian restaurant.
I'm pretty sure that you have an IQ greater than a tsetse fly and have probably put together the fact that Mitsuha and the boy in Tokyo (one Taki) have somehow begun switching bodies. Wackiness ensues as they try to cope with the seemingly random soul-swapping occurrences without fucking over the other person's life, and they set up communication tools between themselves so that they can inform the other what they'd been up to during their other worldly day.
And then, drama... And comedy... And of course lots of death and destruction (this IS an anime, you know).
Your Name, the anime movie 
End of Slight Spoilers
There. That's all you get. And that barely covers only some of the first third of this spectacular, spectacular production. Seriously, watch it. Go find it and watch it! I don't have any stock in this anime production company either. I just love the complete shit out of this film!
The characters are all super fun to hang out with (even with their sometimes weird foibles), and my only issue with them is that I didn't get to see any more of their adventures once the closing credits began to roll. And man, the Japanese voice actors do an incredibly stellar job of vocalizing both their characters, and the other characters in their characters' bodies. The animators did a phenomenal job of animating the two protagonists in the other's bodies too. There was never any mistaking which character was who at any point in this thing. It could have gotten very confusing in lesser hands.
And I need to mention the art in this god-damn on point! Absolutely GORGEOUS animation, scenery, and character expressions. Holy shit, the background artists made Disney hand-drawn movies look like an autistic first grader's shitty finger painting. I'm dead serious. As much as I love The Little Mermaid, go back and pay attention to all the background paintings. There's almost no detail in them. Your Name though, every frame is a literal work of art.
Pretty damn good musical soundtrack by the Radwimps too. It didn't stick in my head as much as a Joe Hisaishi score, but it captured the magic of the movie perfectly by being both worldly and still very much Japanesey at its heart. Good pop songs opened and closed Your Name, and I actually bought the entire album off of iTunes just to relive some of the feels I had while watching it over again.
Honestly, I don't have anything really all that bad to say about it. Well... Except that one issue...
Slight Spoilers.
...having to do with a character apparently never looking at a certain date on their phone, or on a newspaper, or anything... But, within the course of the story, there were decent reasons why this can be overlooked. The haze of the ""dream,"" or whatever. I didn't think about it at all while watching it, and only even noticed it after talking about it with the Greenwood crew when it was over. Like I said though, not a big deal. Nothing at all that could ruin your impression of the movie.
End of Slight Spoilers.
An anime film hasn't hit so close to home, making me associate with the characters so much, since I first saw Kiki's Delivery Service in the mid 90s. Kiki's affected me due to her losing her magic, and its close association with me losing my artistic abilities (or at least the desire to draw and create) at the worst times while I was earning my graphic design degree in college. Your Name hit me hard in the way that it perfectly captured what it means to be a teenager, fall in love, lose love, and face other losses that seem incomprehensible to a young mind. Damn it, I'm tearing up just thinking about it again... That doesn't make me a Mary... IT DOESN'T!... *Sniff*
Anyway, go see it. Don't read anything more about it. Just watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Go. Please.
In the end, I feel that I must give Your Name Two RAGING and THROBBING Thumbs Up. I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about it. I loved the scope of it, the characters, the mecha designs, the music, and the emotions that it makes you feel. For the love of CHRIST! JUST FUCKING WATCH IT!

Shinkai with another love story that again is based on distanced love like his many previous works. The scenarios of trains and forgetting names work well to distance love. It is known in Asian dramas that distanced love is something that appeal to public and is quite overused. 
I expected most of these scenarios before watching the film and I hope Shinkai can move his lazy bones out of this genre. At this point I don't think he knows how to do love stories. You can't just assume love and not show us the intricate details/process/middle part of love. Too much time spent on the
                  pursue of love that is not quite justified. However the story here is a bit less boring to watch compared to his previous works.
Time traveling/body switching mechanics are overused and in my opinion a very lazy way to create suspense. It makes the story overly complex and the use of memory can do a better work here. This mechanics has a interstellar feel to it.
I dont feel the climax is done well, a lot of pointless running/tripping scenes when you should be saving lives. At this point saving lives takes too much focus away from the love theme.

Watching this was an experience that I have never felt before and one that I won't soon forget.

Kimi no Na Wa is a picture by Makoto Shinkai. When I watched this film, I was presented with a rather cliche plot in a fresh and unsusual environment. Throughout the story, there were many soundtracks all of which I thoroughly enjoyed, art sequences that were all unique and well drawn, and characters that were likable. In this story, there are two main characters, which the series focuses on. They both develop from beginning to end.There is a plotline which is adhered to throughout the series and comes to a resolution at the end of the film. I am
                  not sure what else there is to look for other than characters which develop in accordance to the plotline along with a interactive and completed plotline in a romance film. Your Name did everything and more than what one would expect from a romance film. The only reason that the characters didn't get a ten, and received a nine, is because they were somewhat ordinary. However, having ordinary characters still merits a nine as long as they stay in tune with the plotline and develop over the course of the picture.

Story:10       I was lucky enough to avoid all spoilers about Your Name, which for someone who frequents several anime boards is a mostly impossibility. I loved the story and was caught off guard by some
                  of its twists and turns. I was astounded by how the story was able to progress in a two hour movie the way some shows have to do over few seasons. I had to check the date to make sure it actually was a movie and not full season.
Art:10      From the moment I swathe opening I was amazed by the art style and detail contained within. I had heard the artist was good but my mind was blown away. I felt as though I could reach out and touch the walls, as if I move I would feel the wood grain of the floors against the soles of my feet.

                As expected works from Makoto Shinkai and his staff. I almost always like his works, like 5 cm per second and Kotonoha no Niwa. Different from his previous, Kimi no Na wa has more complete aspects, such as not really all sad like 5 cm, and not as flat as Kotonoha no Niwa. Watching this movie will not bring you to an easy expected plot. It has some climax, and turn down, and up again. You will feel like your heart is kind of flaring up.
As always, the music is too good and too match to the movie. There is beating up part, and theres
                  mellow.

NO SPOILERS HERE!
I gave this 10's in all areas except story (9) and character (8). The reason is simple; it's a bit predictable (if you know anything about dramas), and characters are predictable and fairly simple. But it works! Even through the twists and turns, the simple characters and somewhat predictable story keep you captivated.
From the trailer, you would think it's a funny, silly, body switch comedy. But no... it's a beautiful masterpiece with elements of comedy,
                  slice of life, and drama. The art in this piece is so detailed and beautiful. Even when CG is applied at it's poorest, you can overlook it because of how amazing everything is. 
The soundtrack is better than average, and not over used like many anime.
Overall, I'm so glad I watched this. I'm fairly emotionally numb, so numb in fact, Your Lie in April didn't make me cry. This film had me laugh, smile, tear up, and have a few tears actually leave my eyes. I loved it. One of my favorite anime films of all time!",10,Meowhollymeow

                An Absolute masterpiece by Makoto Shinkai
I'll have to admit I was more than a little skeptical about this film as One of Shinkai's previous works ""5 Centimeters Per Second"" really disappointed me. I felt it started off Brilliantly, with excellent Artwork and Scenery, But the second section started to lose my interest and the very ending Really rubbed me the wrong way - It might just be that it wasn't the ending I wanted, But Never the less it soured my taste on the film as a whole. 
Kimi no Na wa fixed all of these issues. 
Fundamentally, It feels a lot like all of
                  Shinkai's previous films, with the focus on how relationships can be effected by distance and time. But the concept also reminded me a lot of Silverlink's ""Kokoro Connect"" (A show where the relationships of the characters are forced to change and grow as they change bodies randomly) which I would also recommend watching. But Finally Shinkai gave me the story I wanted. A Lengthy, drawn out story about 2 people finding each other.
This is the best thing ""Kimi no Na wa"" has going for it - Shinkai has finally crafted characters that are emotionally relatable but also genuine and human. They aren't simply someone to express the core message Shinkai wants to convey, but they have a personality, they laugh, they get angry, they argue, they feel, and they love. It's this distinction that elevates ""Kimi no Na wa"" to such great heights.
Combine this with a heart-warming, well written story, a beautiful soundtrack, and Excellent visuals that Shinkai has never had any trouble with, and you get a true Masterpiece.",10,Mexican_Jeezus

                Having not seen any of Makoto Shinkai's films, I really did not know what to expect from this film. I think it is best to go into this movie without knowing too much about it, just because there are so may surprises in the film that the impact would be lost if you knew about them ahead of time. Of course if you are spoiled, it won't damper your enjoyment of the movie but still try to avoid spoilers. 
Anywho, I adored this film. People were not kidding, the animation was so breathtaking that I had a hard time picking a screencap to make as
                  my wallpaper. (Yea I know Makoto Shinkai films are 106 minutes of anime wallpapers, but hey gotta love good animation!) The score was amazing, Radwimps shooting up to one of my favorite bands at the moment. 
But we could go on and on about how the music and the animation are fantastic, but what about the story? The characters? While its not the greatest and most original story ever told, its execution is what makes this film great. Every development left me on the edge of my seat, drawn to what was going to happen next. I've seen a couple of reviews about how the characters lack depth, but i don't believe that is the case. Our two leads, Taki and Mitsuha are simple characters, but that does no way mean that they are bland or boring. They change each others lives and both become better people by the end, which in my book is what constitutes dynamic characters. They are a boy and a girl who against the odds of space and time, they find a way to be together and it is probably one of the best love stories I have seen lately. Could have the supernatural aspects of the story be explained better? Yes, but im so sick and tired of people always equating no explanations to a bad story. Not everything needs an explanation, as John Keats would say ""heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter""
There is one last thing I would like to say about this movie but it may be a spoiler so if you want nothing to do with spoilers STOP READING NOW! 
Ok, so in the film there is a scene where Taki (in Mitsuha's body) travels with her grandmother and sister to a mountain that is ""the body of their shrine god"". She explains this concept of ""Musubi"" as the tying of a thread that connects people together and I thought this was absolutely beautiful and it really resonated with me. Also the ending...Thank you Makoto Shinkai for not kicking my heart in the dick.",10,lovelybones

                Kimi no Na wa is a beautiful, heartfelt experience that tells the story of a pair of teenagers from Tokyo and rural Japan, respectively. Through some unknown magic or twist of fate, the two switch bodies and experience the others’ life, learning and growing from one another. Through the film’s exploration of the two different lives of the protagonists, it addresses many of the parts of life in Japan for a young adult, both in the city and in more rural areas. Although these details are intended to resonate directly with a Japanese audience, its message has universal elements, such as reduced job opportunities for
                  younger people and increasing dependence on social media. In addition to its social commentary, the film also boasts beautiful animation, with excellent character designs and gorgeous landscapes full of vibrant color. However, the film’s most impressive accomplishment is undoubtedly the interaction between its characters, watching them grow and struggle to accomplish their goals. Each major story beat feels weighty and emotionally significant, and the film captures some of the most important society-wide feelings in Japan during the 2010s. Overall, the film has a deeply emotional narrative, charming characters, and is shockingly relevant to the lives of Japanese teenagers in the 2010s.",10,DucklingPayday

#SPOILERThis was the first anime movie I watched. At the beginning I found it to be a masterpiece like most people. But as I kept watching more anime and I re-watched it... I started to see that it may not be as good as people say
Sure it has breathtaking visuals, an amazing soundtrack, and a very unique plot.
But after taking a closer look... I found that the characters are not really that good. There are many plot holes, questionable character decisions and some small other issues.
First the negatives...
First with the plot...the plot itself is quite unique, its gets points for that but there are so many things that don't make sense. Many people might say that some things should be left unexplained. But you cannot give such excuses when you don't even explain the one supernatural phenomenon the whole movie is based on. Also the scene where the memo start disappearing in front of Taki's eyes was the most absurd scene in the movie...its like they were waiting for Taki to look before disappearing...the scene would have worked a lot better if the memos were already deleted before Taki sees them.
secondly...what would you do if u find out that you can swap bodies with someone else...the first thing I would do is meet the person. But they wait for like 2 months (I guess) and once the phenomenon stops.
finally I didn't find any character to be interesting except the two lead.
now the positive...
The plot is quite unique... I rarely see such a fantastic stories.
The animation is top tier... the lighting, the animation and the breathtaking visuals almost make me forget the plot holes.
the soundtrack is lit, every song in this movie is catchy and I still hear it in my head. Like always it is beautifully directed and the runtime is perfect.
also this anime will always hold a special place for me as it introduced me to the world of anime...
Overall I think that the anime was absolutely beautiful in every way...the only problem i had with this movies was a few of its plot holes and the side characters.",8,Subham0464

                Overall, this is a great movie: the story is excellent and the art is outstanding.
however, it really feels like they had plans for a full anime series, but instead crammed it all into a movie, which means there's less time to emphasize on anything that's not crucial to the story itself, which in turn downgraded my experience, as the main characters felt like they're just ""another character"" instead of a main character because there was simply not enough time and/or emphasis on the main characters' personality.
I feel like if they made this film into a full anime series we would get more emphasis on the
                  main characters' personality, which in turn would make the overall experience better.
Otherwise, this is a great movie. I would recommend to watch it even though the character building isn't exactly its strong side.",8,ranshaa05

                I´m person who grew mainly on Ghibli movies, so I didn´t know what to expect before watching Kimi no Na Wa. And how delightfuly I was surprised.
Tryingn to be as much spoilers free as possible.
This story is about two people, Mitsuha, girl who is from countryside, which grew small for her, and Taki, who probably wasn´t ambitious enough.
They got both get chance to change their bodies, and live life they wanted to try, the city life and the carefree country side.
Of course, it´s not that pretty, as it sounds, and there is big twist after that, but as I said, no spoilers. 
The very first
                  thing I want to point out is the animation. I probably can´t emphasize the beauty of this movie. The face expressions, subtle movements, colors, working with backround x main stage.
I think lots of animes and movies have venues just to have them, but this is not the case. I have stopped and rewinded the movie many times, just I could see those places again. The details are truly magnificient.
If symphony would be animated - this would be it.
Which also leads me to music and sounds in this movie.
There was certain scene with Shrine maidens performing ritual. And as I was watching it, I could hear the cicadas rumbling, fireplaces crackling, people chattering. It felt so natural and not overwhelming. 
No need to tell that soundtrack was really well picked as well, especially both opening and ending songs.
Instead of making this lenghty appraisal, which can turn into cringey essay, I will say this.
I really liked the movie. I shed some tears, I adored soundtrack, I drowned in the fantastic animation, and I love the details it has.
I think, everyone has experiences, they want to forget in order to relive them again and feel those tingly feels again. And Kimi no Na Wa might be one of them.
I might be wrong, and you may not like it and that I´m over exaggerating.
Well, you may not be wrong, but I think this is really piece of art, that should be seen, no matter the opinion, or whether you like animated movie or not.
Just really nice experience, to enjoy this movie",10,Hey_Its_Andrew

That's an amazing anime,a little bit confusing but in the final they explained it  all. A little bit still on the beginning but when the things start being more exited,the anime became one of the best I've ever seen.
The final was very good.
The only ""problem"" for me was the genre,this genre attempt almost the most part of the viewers who likes romance,but for the people who doesn't like this kind of genre,this anime might be a little bit boring,but I think they will like it,I recommend a lot!
The art is really god,one of the best I've ever seen;
The story was really nice,but in the

The characters are good but I think the guy is a little bit stupid.

                LOOK Your name has faults. But just don't say that the story doesn't make any kind of logical sense.
The timelines do connect and intertwine with each other, its just that Shinkai was so encompassed on bringing in the plot twist, that he didn't even think of leaving a clue of the fact, thatour characters were actually living in a different timeline. Its just convulated and at times oversaturated with content, which didnt get enough time to properly bloom. 
To enjoy your name you need to be a bit on the biased and non- critical side of viewing. I feel like your- name's premise is extremely
                  simple and at times under-developed.. but this film or any shinkai's works in  general have to be judged on their ability to be able to resonate themes like emotions, destiny and life philosophy in general and not on the basis of its kind of logically defunct story. 
Your name's story is simple, the characters are normal, and they are teens most of all. They body-swap and one day it stops altogether. The guy gets curious as to why it stopped due to very obvious reasons (its just obvious counting on the fact the these two people, shared their bodies and life intimately) and finds out that the girl is dead and from a different timeline. In typical anime fashion he decides to save her; by altering the course of time and forgets about her as per the Musubi laws. And thats it. 
Now this is kind of generic and boring, so why did it appeal so frickin many people? well its the way its presented. The emotions and feels aren't forced and they are just natural, the character choices resonate well with themes of longing and that hideous inner gut feeling/ intimacy we feel about someone. And mostly it isn't a generic love story about kisses and boobs.
Your name is just unique because of the way it presents ""love"" and ""life"" in general. Its more about the theme, tone and the lessons you learn from the story, than the technicality of the plot. 
Characters are simply normal and not neccesarily flat, but a bit development wouldve worked.
Art- Just marvellous
Sound- The reason why I love your name so much, while the story is simple, its deeper meaning is well presented by its soundtrack and man the lyrics are so beautiful and poetic.
All in all. Your name is about raw human emotions, metaphors, life and longing. Although it doesn't have any moral message, the way it shows desperation and emotions without making it look pretentious and melodramatic, and making you go through a range of feelings. Is what makes Your name so special. Its the simplicity. Its the thought.  For what your name stands i.e its inner themes, its does really well and just makes you realise the complexity of love and the importance of it as well. its unique take on love based on intimacy and connection is what makes it great. 
So if you are a person who is overly analytical, then this film is simply not for you. 
Just enjoy the film, and understand its core message, because there isn't any other like this.
MY SCORE IN DECIMALS - 9.35",10,siddhass26
32281,"
                Wow. The feels man, the feels.
Let me just state from the jump that Kimi no Na wa (Your Name) is a true and undeniable anime movie classic.
I will admit I haven't really delved into the filmography of Makoto Shinkai, who at this point has really cemented himself as the premier contemporary anime movie maker. I watched Voices of a  Distant Star years ago and didn't think much of it, and thus avoided all his future works, until i started reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews for his latest project. Now im salivating to watch his entire catalogue. It is very obvious he has perfected his
                  craft in the years since VOADS, and frankly, if he makes a movie better than Your Name i will be shocked, as it is nigh on perfection.
To sum up the storyline without giving away spoilers, it is like a cross between Freaky Friday and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, with some time travel thrown into boot. It also has one of the most affecting teen romances ive ever seen depicted in anime (and as we all know, teen anime romances are usually depicted with all the subtlety of a wrecking ball). Its truly an emotional journey, and most importantly the incredibly touching finale is earned. Tears will fall people, it's a certainty. Have your kleenex ready.
The animation is stunning. Dude it is beyond stunning. Coupled with a great soundtrack, it's just a treat for the eyes and ears. 
Classic anime movies are very few and far between these days. I can easily say that Kimi no Na wa is the finest anime movie ive watched since the glory days of the late great Satoshi Kon.

                Just got back from the 10:20 PM showing of the Funimation release of ""Your Name"" at Century Cinema 16 in Mountain View around 2 hours ago (as of writing this).
Here's a short review with as little spoilers as possible.
Review (Dubbed Version) : 
Story : 9 - Psychologically sophisticated and intriguing, while simple enough to understand. Throw in an engaging story involving romance, comedy, slice of life, symbolism, plot twists and you have ""Your Name"". The synopsis barely scratches the surface of what is presented on the screen.
Art : 10 - Beautiful. All of the characters are beautifully drawn, and all of the environments and objects
                  pop out at your face.
Sound : 10 - Radwimps, you've outdone yourself on the OST. Great music for all the scenes, really sets the mood perfectly for every single scene that calls for it. For example, the track ""Date"" and ""Date 2"" are essentially the same track, but the dissonance introduced in the same tracks contribute all that much more to the feeling/mood of the scene. 
Background sounds felt incredibly realistic as well, from the footsteps to the city trains. 
Characters : 10 - Taki and Mitsuha, both 17 year old teenages with different personalities; lovable characters. Not dense, not too overpoweringly smart, but just how a teenager should be. The supporting characters are also extremely prominent in the movie, and contribute to many of the events and elements for the plot; all of them felt as if they all played a ""main character"" role.
Dubbing : 9 - The English dub was great, the voices fit well for all of the characters. The only thing that was a bit off was the lip syncing and the mouth timings for certain lines. Aside from that, the overall timing for the rest of the lines felt natural and was paced at a good speed. 
Enjoyment/Overall rating : 10 - Great movie, intriguing story, beautifully drawn characters and backgrounds, breathtaking soundtrack along with background sounds, overall amazing.
One of the, if not, the best movie I've ever seen.
You get something for everyone. The English dub might make a few people who enjoy the original language with subtitles more feel a bit uncomfortable in the beginning, but it'll most likely grow on you throughout the movie. The English dub does also help out in many parts to help the viewer understand the situation better, and it also prevents you from looking at the subtitles the whole time, so you can have your eyes on the faces of each character too. 
Love comedy? There are scenes that are perfect for getting a giggle out of the viewers. 
Love Romance along with a compelling, well written, and deep story? You'll find plenty of it throughout the whole movie.
Bring your kids, your grandchildren, your sisters, brothers, and your significant other (perfect date movie, it's cute). 
The only downsides are that, I did have a few questions and felt a little confused on some of the events leading up to others which was occuring in the later parts of the story, but these were extremely minor and had little effect on the experience. Also, I'll never be able to fondle Mitsuha's boobs like Taki did in the movie.
 Other than that, 10/10. Must watch.",10,AsphyxiateMe

                Calling Kimi no Na wa a masterpiece or something else is not even a valid argument nowadays, more than ever it's been stamped, solidified, and rendered into a fact that many people like to forget and disregard, it's a movie that got countless people into Anime and served as the neutral introduction to many, many fans of the medium. It broke records, hearts, and top-10 lists more than anyone can count and even today it remains as high ground as day one.
- Story (9/10):
Probably among all of Shinkai's works, this one has the most fleshed out and interesting plot by far. There is something very
                  magical and tragic about how everything was laid out from the first minute, not until the first third of the movie passed, we are still wondering about the mystery that seems to possess the consequential events, bit by bit, as you realize that things start to fall off the timeline, things happen out of the order, there is this eery vibe that drives the early part of the movie until it all hits and the supernatural element of the story unravels, by which, the intensity builds up and it's non-stop from there.
Without diving into any spoilers, the movie really takes its time building up to the climax but never does it feel slow or dragged out, even the famous cliché Shinkai montages that highlight the passage of time are placed well and time perfectly that it gives off the perfect amount of anticipation.
- Art (10/10):
Kimi no Na wa usually comes off as a benchmark when looking at something animation and art wise and it definitely did not earn this status from naught.
Back in 2016, it was a phenomenon of animation achievement, no, it was magical, out of this world, and is still today nothing less than what it was on day 1, mesmerizing and inspiring through and through.
 Shinkai has proven himself as a master of his craft several times but it was with this movie that he broke records some of which he has set up himself and still to this day, several years later, nothing came as close as hyping up its animation to the same degree.
People would get offended and involved in the never-ending controversies of mixing CGI with 2D animations but it was everywhere in this movie but never was it out of place or badly integrated, so much so that no one even realizes, like those meteor and stary sky scenes, just marvelous and on a league of its own. The character designs were alright, but it was the environment that took the cake.
- Sound (10/10):
Adding up to the incredible visuals, the music fidelity in this movie is just as astonishing. A lot of talent has worked in this movie but this department inspired a big part of this movie, from the top tier OSTs to the heart-felt voice acting that felt more genuine than real daily life conversations, it's a craft hard to pull off but Kimi no Na wa had all the rule of thumbs checked up from the first minute to the credits roll-up.
- Characters (8/10):
A similarity that has always connected Shinkai movies was that the characters in question never carried the story but rather were carried by the flow of events too big for anyone to control. This shared universe between Makoto's stories is the true main character, sprouting several circumstances that connect nameless characters together and forms a comprehensive plot that manages to circle back on itself.
The fact that the movie is titled Your Name and the fact that the protagonists go on not knowing and/or forgetting each other's name just goes to show that they are in fact placeholder character that can be switched up easily and the story would still retain its intensity and mystery unscathed.
- Enjoyment (10/10):
I loved sitting through this movie. I loved watching it years ago and I loved rewatching it now, just as impactful as I remember and with no signs of being dated by any measures, stilling the same old show ahead of its time in every other way, it is and will be Shinkai's masterpiece that even himself will have to surpass and it's not gonna be easy.
- Overall (9.4/10):
Honestly, for this movie to be recommended and viewed even by people who have no idea about what Anime is is reason enough to inflict curiosity and make you wanna check it out, heck, even if you've already seen it in quite some time now, it's a great idea to revisit it and look back on how your outlook on it has changed over time.
I know a huge majority of people who dislike the mainstream or hate on something just for the same of hating do exist, but come on, until when are you gonna keep rejecting media that has the potential to become your favorite?",9,Eoussama

                Your Name is an animated film by Makoto Shinkai, probably my favourite director for anime or just movies in general. Other pieces Makoto Shinkai is well known for include Distant Star and, of course, Five Centimeters per Second. Your Name, or Kimi No Na Wa as it’s known in Japan, is about two high school students, Mitsuha and Taki, switch bodies. Each of them live in very different areas of Japan. Taki being from Tokyo and Mitsuha being from a rural area in Japan. The mysterious events of their body swapping, which happens a few times every week, all begins on the day when a
                  mysterious shooting star falls across the sky. 
The Animation:
It is clear when watching this film that the animators must have poured their hearts and souls into these visuals. The truly spectacular scenes where this is particularly apparent is when we see the shooting star near the start of the film and the final scene of the movie. The amount of time and effort which must have been put into these moments and the entire film must have been huge. The animators hard work has clearly been well worth it. The level of detail in the light and the shading is astonishing. Another part of the animation which I really appreciate, is the fact that all the places shown in the film are real places which you can go and visit. This even goes as far as the billboards in some scenes being the same as the ones in the real place, meaning someone had to gain the rights to show the real adverts in this movie. So that just goes to show how much effort the animators when through to make this film feel immersive and real.
Overall, I give the animation of this film a 10/10.
Story:
The story of Your Name is arguable simple. Two people having their bodies swapped and living in each others shoes has been done many times before, like in Freaky Friday. But, I believe that even with this somewhat simple plot Shinkai has really used the characters in the story to really make the audience feel for these people. When we see Mitsuha in her home with her family, we really do feel like they are a family and that they feel real like they actually exist. In addition, with Taki, we see and can sympathise with his struggles with balancing his social, school, and work lives. Although Your Name does have comedic moments and serious dramatic moments, it doesn’t feel like the film is “switching genres” halfway through or like one moment it’s all fun and gags and the next it's overly dramatic. It all feels consistent and the humour of the film does not clash with the more heart wrenching parts. One of my favourite parts of the entire film, is the ending. I feel that Makoto Shinkai has given the audience an ending which is satisfying but still leaves enough unanswered to let the audience think.
Overall, the story gets a 8/10.
The soundtrack:
The soundtrack of Your Name is, in my opinion a big part of the film. WIthout the songs from Radwimps I don’t think the film would be as good as it is. Simply just because their songs are used perfectly to fit the scenes to evoke emotions like sadness, relief, and happiness in the audience. Whenever I hear a song from Your Name, I get goosebumps, because the soundtrack really does have a big part in the emotional scenes in the film, so when you listen to them it brings all back.
Overall, the soundtrack gets an 10/10.
Conclusion and final thoughts:
After watching Your Name twice now I really do believe this film could be thought of as a modern classic in anime. So far I would say that this is probably the best of Makoto Shinkai’s works. And I think a lot of people would agree. Your Name actually gained a total gross of 358 million us dollars, making it the highest grossing animated film and japanese film of all time. Beating out films like the Incredibles, Aladin, and all the other classic american and japanese animated films. According to some reports people re-watched the film up to twelve times at the cinema. I can understand that because when i watched Your Name a second time, it was different from watching it the first time because you notice so many different things. Like the red ribbon of fate, the opening basically spoiling the whole movie if you pay attention and little hints at the ending and the big twist of the story throughout the film. I really did love Your Name or Kimi No Na Wa and would say it’s one of, or is, my favorite film. 
Overall, I give Your Name a score of 10/10.",10,J891319

I watched this one with a friend of mine and it was breathtaking. It's right up there in my top 5 movies because you could tell there was a lot of love put into it. The whole concept of switching bodies and the element of comedy and mystery tying in together made for something that engaged your heart along with your eyes. Visually, the best art I've seen in an anime, hands down. Emotionally, there were scenes where I stood out out of my chair because of how compelling the story was. At one point I was literally on the ground crying and my
                  friend sat on the floor with me to be sad with me. I just really can't believe that this anime had the ability to literally stir me enough that I had to move around while I watched it because it gave me so much energy- but this anime did. 
There is a shift in the anime where it goes from lighthearted comedy and slice of life to mystery and psychological and it works out to be very engaging. The slice of life and comedy section built up and developed the characters to the point where you were very attached to them and the mystery and psychological aspect was so necessary and made for a story arc that you didn't want to see...you NEEDED to see. There were scenes that had me heart broken and scenes that had me excited and I think that future anime can learn from this one simply because its one of those stories for me that I didn't need to think about- I opened the review, I hit ten out of ten on all aspects, because I knew this is an anime that was absolutely brilliant and there's nothing that I would ever dare to change.
tl;dr if a doctor told you you only had an hour and fifty two minutes left before you died, watch Kimi no Na wa",10,kiki-jiji

                As my first movie review on MAL I felt I’d do a movie very close to my heart. I’ve watched anime casually and hardcore at various intervals of my life and for some reason there’s always something that makes me come back to it. What is this thing that makes anime so special? This movie, Kimi No Na Wa (Your Name.) made me realise what that thing was.
I believe I saw the movie for the first time in 2018, a little over 2 years after its release. Of course I’d heard of its critical acclaim through other followers of the genre. The art was meant
                  to be incredible, and the story far more developed than Makoto Shinkai’s other work like ‘The Garden of Words’ or ‘5 Centimetres Per Second’. These other works had been stunning, revolutionary and what they lacked in depth and story was more than compensated for by the quality of the animation. Certainly they were masterpieces of the Japanese animated movie scene yet they were not at the level which I could say was a complete package. I had long wanted a film with the beauty of these two previous works but with a story on par with that art.
This is where Kimi No Na Wa comes in. With high, high expectations and a yearning for a meaningful story from someone I considered a great director. And it did not disappoint.
I can’t convey through words how truly incredible this movie was in the truest sense of the word. The movie is excellent and is built on through humour, and unexpected twists and turns. In terms of emotion this movie is certainly one of the few films which I have cried over. It’s a medley of imagination which Makoto Shinkai has been withholding from us for all these years. In this movie it seems he really found himself, although he says that he feels the movie is unfinished.
When talking about this director one thing immediately springs to mind, the quality of animation in his work. His movies in my opinions are some of the most beautiful pieces of art in the anime scene. Compared to ‘The Garden of Words’, Kimi No Na Wa does not quite have the same level of beauty but it is certainly a beautiful movie. The mountain and city landscapes contrast perfectly and lead to ample opportunities for the movie to showcase its extraordinary landscapes. The art in this case rather than being the centre of attention is more of a light addition to the story rather than the dominant, overbearing force it has been in previous works. It works together with the story to create what I would currently call one of the best Japanese animated films ever. The box office statistics agree.
The story follows two teenagers who unexpectedly in their dreams switch bodies and live in each others bodies during that time. They find a way to communicate and all sorts of hilarious scenes occur. I won’t spoil the later plot for you, but it’s definitely what you’d call an ‘emotional roller coaster’.
In conclusion Kimi No Na Wa is what I would define as a masterpiece. Makoto Shinkai has reached the zenith of his career by creating what can only be described as a masterpiece and a cumulation of many people’s efforts. The art, the story, the genuine connection the movie creates between you and the protagonists is something unrivalled in most other anime movies I have seen, like ‘5 Centimetres Per Second’. This is without a doubt one of my favourite anime movies to date.",8,Sigurd42

                Yes, Senpai, blame me for joining the ranks of 10/10 reviewers. However, I couldn't pass on the opportunity to comment on something so amazing.
Art - 10
I will start with one of the many things this anime excels in, and that is art. It truly is magnificent with bright colors, 3-D effects and a lot of attention to detail, the art of Kimi no Na wa will swallow you into its world from the very beginning! The transition between the scenes is smooth, the scenery is great, making it feel more like a real movie, rather than an animated picture film.
Sound - 10
Now, there aren't many
                  soundtracks that end up in my ""Favorites"" playlist, however, the ending song of Kimi no Na wa is right there, on its top. It is just so beautiful and pleasant, that it actually motivated me to learn Japanese, so I could understand it better. Furthermore, the voice acting is especially admirable without many ""Whaaa!? Nani!?"" moments that we are so accustomed to from other anime, bringing more depth and meaning into every phrase spoken throughout this film.
Story - 9
The real story of Kimi no Na wais much deeper and complex than just a boy and a girl switching bodies, therefore this part of the story (as mentioned in previous reviews) does indeed feel rushed, sometimes resorting to screen-shots or simple text messages. Therefore, I feel that dedicating a bit more time to showing us the virtues that the two MCs got up to while in each-others bodies, would greatly benefit the story.
Character(s) - 9
The world of Kimi no Na wa evolves around two main characters, who are very well-presented and described during the film. However, this is one of the times, where not much is known about the support characters, who remain in the shadows of this masterpiece. Some might argue, that bringing out the personalities of the support characters would distract the viewer from the main story, however, as things stand - it feels that everyone (part the MCs) is there just for the number. A little more screen time and depth in description of support characters' personalities definitely wouldn't hurt.
Enjoyment/Overall - 10
Even considering minor imperfections, Kimi no Na wa would keep you watching at the edge of your seats, while experiencing emotions, that you thought were long-forgotten. 10/10 would watch it again!

                Up to this day, I still remember why I've gotten a liking to anime. After rewatching Your Name, these past memories whether it's tragic or unforgettable, soon flashed right before my eyes as I hear the gentle touch of the film's ost.
The way the world is drawn beautifully, the way the plot is written carefully, the way the characters are shaped, and the way the music is composed. Everything about Your Name is exceptionally crafted to perfection, and even if it didn't connect to everyone, at least, someone, like me, felt a deep attachment to the film as if it were someone related. It's truly
                  amazing how a piece of art can appeal to a certain someone, because behind it is a person, or a group that put their efforts in making it, wanting to connect with people.
I couldn't count how many times I've shed a tear for no apparent reason while watching the film. Perhaps it's because of the music, maybe it's because of a scene, or I guess I won't ever know why.
To search for something you're clueless of and to experience something extraordinary. Perhaps a person like me wishes for it to happen, but I know it already happens to me right now, I'm just not aware of it. At the end of the day, behind this rambling and tweets of mine, I'm grateful to be introduced to an art called anime. Every experience I had related to it is fun, and it surely did bring light to the darkness of nights. It may not be perfect and behind it is an issue worth solving, but I'm proud to say that anime has become part of my life.
Oh and if I were asked, ""What's the best film ost you've ever heard?"", I'll surely reply, ""Mitsuha's Theme"".
It's a song perfect for reminiscing good ol' memories and experiences with the things you loved.
Right now you're probably wondering why this review isn't all about the film, but rather it's just nonsense. I simply can't think of words to a piece with little flaws. It had so much good in it that it foreshadowed the bad parts. Though to be honest, I watched Your Name for the first time when I was 14 years old and it was confusing as fuck, though I did cry and enjoy it despite not knowing what the fuck is going on.",10,Akira_Habane

                Kimi No Na Wa
What caught my eye about this anime was an animated music video featuring clip from this movie. I thought, holy smokes this guy is trying extremely hard to find this girl, and this girl is doing likewise. I began wondering why they are doing that. How they might know each other. What kind of relationship they might have. And it turns out that I began rooting for them.
This original story creates a fun, suspense-filled, and romantic atmosphere. The anime is original because it's hard to imagine waking up in a woman's body, and her wake up in yours for a day. Odd,
                  that. How would it play out? Yes, there are likely some nice things to take interest in. Now how does the rest of the day turn out? These characters are shot back and forth not once, but multiple times within weeks. Their lives begin to change and the people around them begin to change. It's fun.
On to the ratings:
Story - 9 - The beginning of the story is playful and without any real meaning. The second half of the story really gets into the meet and brings on some serious suspense that is well earned from the first part of the story. The purpose holds true.
Graphics - 10 - Very sexy artwork at times and some extreme detailed put into the scenes at certain times. The art is bursting with flavour.
Soundtrack - 10 - The soundtrack is very soothing at times and full of energy during others. I enjoyed listening to the background music, and the sound effects such as the bell ringing were well placed and performed.
Character Personas - 10 - The two main characters are opinionated and distinct. In fact, this was reinforced in order to determine the nuances between the male and female gender and how they behave in certain situations.
Character Voiceover - 10 - Hard to give a lower score. The two main characters even lightened or deepened their voice depending on who was in their body.
Overall - 9
Recommended - Yes, if you are looking for a nice romantic tale with a bit of humour and suspense to keep you going.",9,mrbeckham09

                Kimi no Na wa is a great movie for sure. I'd definitely recommend you check it out!
As for story, the old switching bodies trope once again makes its reappearance. The entire story could be summarized in a paragraph, and it's not exactly full of innovative ideas (despite a single amazing twist). There's a lot of world-building going on for the first half of the movie, which is always welcome. I prefer this kind of pacing to jumping straight into heavy drama.
The characters is where Kimi no No wa starts to get better. Once the stage was set and the plot gets going, I found myself
                  on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen to our young protagonists, Taki Tachibana and Mitsuha Miyamizu. While I would say those two are decent by themselves, it's really their relationship and their interactions that makes them. The drama and mystery that happens between them was fascinating to watch unfold. They both have some depth (thanks to the long set-up) and their devotion to each other despite their short history and different backgrounds is remarkable. Some would say that it's irrational, but that's where I respond with something like ""love is irrational!"" or something cheesy like that. If I had to justify their actions with something from real life, I'd say it's similar to the feeling you have after waking up from an amazing dream: you feel like you've lived an entire lifetime of feelings and those emotions haunt you for the rest of the day. They hold onto that feeling for the whole movie. Although the focus of Kimi no Na wa is on our two protagonists, the side characters play an important role of helping our mains develop. The side characters have some depth of their own as well.
The sound and music were pretty good. A lot of the tracks were pleasant to listen to, and all of them fit the scenes perfectly. None of the exactly stuck out as amazing, but they certainly set the mood well.
The best part of Kimi no Na wa is definitely the art. It's truly deserving of the 10/10 outstanding rating. Everything is just so clean, deep, and colorful. The beautiful depictions of the backgrounds, nature, and especially the skies left me desperately scouring my mind to recall if the real life looked just as good. Maybe it's because I don't get out much, or because I live in the city, but I had forgotten what a starry night looked like. I'd recommend pausing the movie every once in a while to just absorb all the details. A lot of animes use art simply as a vehicle to deliver their characters and stories, but this one puts the art in the driver's seat.
An almost overdone premise rescued by the relationship between Taki and Mitsuha and exalted by its extraordinary art leaves Kimi no Na wa with a score of 9.",9,zeralul

                Honestly, What really matters when making a movie is whether or not it was enjoyable, and it certainly was for me. It has always been a film even among all of the non-anime films that always stood out to me. (includes very very slight spoilers)
Story and Characters:
Certainly the story and character developments could've been better and more detailed with many flaws that could be pointed out, but regardless of what some of these critics say, this movie is fantastic. The point is not to be critical and enjoy it in a literal sense, the story is not outstanding or is it flawless when you think
                  about it but it serves its job as a driving force in the film that keeps it going. The characters aren't TOO deeply delved into to the point where I can say that I love them but they certainly feel like real, likable people with the way they act which deserves a 7.
Art and Sound:
Honestly one of the main things that has really stood out to me other than the fact that it undeniably looks absolutely gorgeous, was that the music was beyond amazing. I am still very shocked at how well Makoto Shinkai and Radwimps incorporated music into the scenes so well, it's incredible and a complete masterpiece in that regard. The art was also great of course, but it is no match for the synergy between the music, mood, and cinematography which I will be talking about next.
Cinematography:
I am a fan of cinematography, when done well, it can really set the mood add so much more to a scene which would otherwise be dull without it. Makoto Shinkai really outdid himself in this one, my favorite one had to be when the camera is viewing Itomori from above while the blackout is happening in the region with Sparkle playing in the background, it might as well be one of my favorite scenes in all of anime, just beyond belief how well that was executed. Watched it over 5 times and it still has me mesmerised every time. 
Why Overall is 10:
I mean the movie certainly has its flaws, its not as great as it could be but all films have their ups and downs, I have yet to see a piece that I'd view as perfect but this certainly gets close in the enjoyment department. It's a film that you should go into without giving it too much thought, if you do you'll ruin the vibes. And that's what I believe this movie is unmatched for, just the mood and vibes it radiates is the main reason why it's a 10. ""It's not that deep"" works extremely well in this situation, don't think too deep about it and ruin that innocence you first have when you watch the movie, and you'll find it to be a 10 out of 10 as well. Sometimes it's not about the technical parts that makes a movie good, it's just how you FEEL about the movie that matters most. 
""Go with your heart"" is what I'd say if people want to enjoy the movie or see it from a different perspective, that's why even though I agree with many of the scores on the lower end of the spectrum, the movie still retains a relatively high one.",10,Will_-

                Anime is a medium for many things. It can be used to create breathtaking scenery and memorable characters. Explosive action and tranquil calms, it can create entire new worlds for us to experience and enjoy. The potential it has is unlimited, but most importantly, anime can be used to tell a story. 
Kimi no na wa is precisely that, a story. It's gorgeous scenery and animations woven through time and memory craft one of the most unforgettable movies I have ever watched. The emotions and memories of its main characters play out across the screen through its awe inspiring storytelling. I felt inspired. I felt
                  awestruck. In 90 minutes I felt like I had experienced more life through these characters than I did with 25 years of my own.

                As someone who has seen both the japanese version and the english version all I can say is that this film goes beyond expectations.
Kimi no Na wa or Your Name its a film where you can easily recommend it to someone who is new to the idea of anime and other related merchandise but doesn't want to start with an older series.
I've spoken to a few people after both viewings and one thing everyone that everyone agreed on is that they would recommend it to both anime fans and people who are not fans in general as its a film everyone can get behind and
                  fall in love with.
To put it simple it can become an emotional journey, theres plenty of character development between the two main protagonists and you can clearly see how both adjust to the situation, the ending brings a smile to my face and makes an overall satifying experience.
Kimi no Na wa does a fantastic job of drawing the audience in and keeping them throughout the journey of the film.
I personally love the film and i recommend that everyone if their an anime fan or not watchs the film, as its taken the anime fanbase by storm and has risen to the rank of #1 taking the title from FMA: Brotherhood which in time on MyAnimeList has been the top anime.
I raise a glass to the director Makoto Shinkai and finally want to say that alongside his other pieces of work that its done more then enough to satisfy any doubts i've had and I look forward to what the future holds.",10,LoveAnime93

                Here's my quick review for people who can't be asked to read paragraphs. This movie although doesn't have a real sense to it, still shows the meaning of what it was trying to show. A movie that helps put relationships into sense for people and what it means to truly ""love"". This show will make sure you understand what it means to love and express your feelings. It may have a super natural and unrealistic sense to it, but if you truly look behind the story and the development it has more to it. People criticize pretty harsh on the story and characters, but there's
                  more to it than just the story and characters, it's how they intertwine and mix into one. This movie is without a doubt a watch in my book. At the end of the day when I finished watching this I felt it was finished and nothing more to develop on it, I would like to see more, but the ending leaves me satisfied. This was a top rated movie in japan for a reason, it shows when you watch it and finish it as well.",10,GreenDevil79

                Background: After much hype, I waited for the Funimation dub release in theatres. The showing was near-full, and all patrons were respectful and engaged by the film.
STORY - 7
The plot is developed probably 1/4 to 1/2 way point of the film. While I was anticipating a big revelation or coherency to the main plot questions - why are they switching, why do they forget, etc. - it was never met. Overall it read as a slice of life with some quirks, some angst, some magic, and was very reminiscent of the manga/movie ""Calling You"".
ART - 10
Coming off of ''Bryousoku 5 Centimeter"" I expected nothing less
                  than a fantastical, engaging art style. The settings of the two characters were also strongly juxtaposed - a rural country village, and the big metro area that is Tokyo. Shinkai and his team did a phenomenal job with the art.
SOUND - 9 
I was thoroughly surprised how tranquil and catchy the soundtrack was. RADWIMPS did great work in both Japanese and English. I downloaded the English versions as soon as I got out the theatre. The seiyuus in the Japanese versions were fitting and I felt both male voiceactors did a great job portraying the ""change"". I really like the casting for the dubbed versions.
CHARACTER - 7 
It's with a heavy heart I'd have to critique that the true character of both protagonists was only hinted at, and we did not get a solid development of them as people (while they are still highschool students - most people have a pretty distinguishable characteristics). The most realistic thing is how ""odd' those in their normal lives found how the acted, how they tried to live out their lives, etc.
ENJOYMENT - 10
Where the plot and character falls through, the climatic moments, artwork, and ending led to one of the most enjoyable films for me - in a true Shinkai fashion.

                I was curious as to why this is the highest rated anime on the website, and just then I watched the movie and I can say to some extent I can see why it's considered to be well-received. 
Story:
There are a lot of loose ends in the story that I have noticed. The overall theme in this narrative is lost love, which is excellently portrayed but I feel like in certain aspects it becomes a bit unnecessary and kind of cliche. However, there overarching story was beautiful, and kinda of played a thrilling role and really engaged me. Ain't gonna lie, I had mad anxiety
                  watching the plot unfold. I feel like they did a really good job at portraying the story - despite it being somewhat cliche, through the art and sound. I just wished they actually spent more effort in certain parts of the overarching narrative rather than the theme 'distant love'
Art:
Art was exceptional. The colours of 'twilight' and the comet was so breath taking. I love how it captures the contrast of the bustling city life and the mundane, cosy country life. The little details drawn to me so much, such as how a character sketches, and food, and the phones within the anime. These little touches really brings the anime to life, and contributed a lot to the enjoyment.
Sound:
The first time I listened to RADWIMPS was a few years ago. I remember I described the music as 'nostalgic, as if you were reminiscing your high-school life', no kidding. When the opening of the anime was played, I knew immediately it was played by RADWIMPS. The band gave the anime the nostalgic feeling of youth, fun and overall nostalgia. The songs they played fit incredible well with the overall genre and theme of high-school slice of life. The other OSTS played beautifully, and overall the sound aspect really drew me in and made me feel so nostalgic about high-school.
Character:
The characterisation is nothing new, and kind of disappointing. With the anime being rated as the highest, I kind of expected them to explore with different character profiles rather sticking to the norm slice-of-life boy meet girl characters. Although none were unpleasant, and was all rather enjoyable. I kinda expected more, especially since the art and sound was hella good. 
Enjoyment + Overall:
It was a great anime. I laughed, I almost cried, I held my breath, and I was overall really glad I watched this anime. It was a really nice breath of fresh air. It was a nice, sweet anime that explores a very supernatural concept of time.",8,soomyu

                You know, I've been contemplating this review for a while. Not about the score itself necessarily, but more about what I look forwards to in an Anime. I've seen this movie three times now, each on separate theatre showings in the U.S., and every time so far, Kimi no Na Wa has left me wanting to come back for more. And in all honestly that is what I think is most important about an Anime. Sure, I could go on about how the art, sound, characters, etc. are 'x' amount of points out of 10, but I don't think Anime should just be all about
                  that. Kimi no Na Wa has made me feel for a show on a personal level, despite me sharing little to nothing with the characters and I'll be damned if that doesn't count for anything other than just a raw score. Kimi no Na Wa, has left me an experience that has left me a lasting memory that has made me appreciate Anime more as a medium, that in itself I think is more than enough reason to wholeheartedly recommend this show to anyone I know or might know in the future.",10,AvantAveGarde

                Check out my review for A Silent Voice cuz a lot of what I say about that movie can be transcribed to fit with this movie except this movie is about only 76% as good as that one.
If you can ignore some overly cliche moments/scenes and some major plot inconsistencies and a major plot hole then this movie should be fine for you otherwise, don't rush to see it.
If you're still sticking around then touch on a few things that kind of ruined the movie for me a little.
- The art style while being excellently executed falls into some very generic looking character designs. This
                  normally wouldn't be a problem since there are many anime that aren't unique in their style but in the case of this movie it sticks out like a sore thumb because of the limited set of characters.
- The music can be overly generic most of the time. I've been a practising musician for nearly 10 years and I just expected a bit more than a few generic pop songs to 'hype' me up for these 'dramatic' moments.
- (This point contains spoilers so you'll have to trust me when I say this is a legitimate reason to be peeved with this movie) Just... the plot...

The movie is surreal. The story may sound like a fantasy but you’ll be amazed by how Makoto Shinkai makes it feel like a real life event. Even the places are mostly real world locations.

                When I started watching Kimi No Na Wa. I had read the synopsis and was ready for some body-swapping and romance, but this movie was so much more.
Spoiler alert!
Story: The story centers around two people living in different places (Tokyo and a rural town), who experiences going to sleep and sometimes waking up in each others body. They try to figure out how to cope with this in their everyday life and then starts searching for each other. This is where i gets more difficult as the guy finds that the girl lived in a town that was annihilated by a falling comet 3 years
                  prior. He starts searching for her and ends up going into a spiritual time travel in order to save her and the other residents of his town, only to forget her in the end, but remembering that he was searching for something. They manage to change the course of history saving a major part of her towns populace. The story ends when they finally meet 5 years after his attempt to save her, both recognizing, but not remembering each other. The story is a quite good variant of a time travel story, with romance, drama and hints of comedy in addition. Towards the end the story had me frustrated as I desperately wanted them to finally meet and start remembering what they did together. It was a good and detailed story (though somewhat confusing) that could have been even better if they added or changed ever so slightly some twists.
Art & Sound: The art was quite good, but had some problems with consistency, especially when it came to some of the characters, but with quite stellar landscapes. And the sound was very good, though not the best.
Characters: The characters in this story were well built and all had their own lives, though we did not get to see much of them.
Overall: I really liked this movie and the way it presented itself. The movie was longer than most, but, as there could be so much material, I can't help but feel that it was still a bit rushed. In my opinion this problem could easily  be solved by remaking it as a show instead, adding to the screen time, and as such allowing us to further connect with the characters and the story. I feel that it then would've become a superb slice of life-, romance-, mystery- anime. And an after story of their lives after meeting up again would surely be well recieved ;-)",8,ThorNN-heim7

Not only that, but the plot unfolds quite nicely and the characters aren't all that bad either.

Great movie, although there are some things that really put me off or didn't satisfy me.
Art: 9.5/10. Great and sharp visuals, good animation and beautiful backgrounds and skies. VO was also good. Only thing I didn't like that much was the OST, definitively not my taste of music, not bad, just not for me.
Characters: 8/10. Not too bad, the main duo was interesting, although we don't get to know much about them. Probably I'm judging their depth like I would judge
                  a 12+ episodes anime, which definitively doesn't fit the time constraints of a movie, but it's just sad that the main duo doesn't seem to show any special traits nor hobby/passion. On the other hand I really appreciate that they didn't go for cliché characters at all, which is also probably why it worked that well internationally.
Also worth mentioning how bad the secondary characters were. They didn't seem to serve any purpose or have any depth, other than help the plot progress. Mitsuha's friends were plain, but Taki's friends were awful, if they weren't there at all no one would've noticed. At least Mitsuha's friends helped in some way on the story (Katsuhiko helped hack the transmission system and built the explosives, Sayaka helped doing the announcement), but Taki's friends were completly pointless other than make the character show that he has friends. Not a fan of Miki either.
Story: 7/10. Probably the weakest part of the movie. I love sci-fi and supernatural stuff, but usually it kinda makes sense on the scope of the story. For example, on Death Note or Steins;Gate, it's clear from the beginning how the whole thing works, and the things that are unknown are discovered by the characters and make sense on the whole story. On this movie nothing is clear, and most questions can be answered with ""it's magic"" and nothing would change. For example, it's never explained in a way that makes sense when everything is happening, why are those 2 connected specifically, when the connection happens (and how), why when this connection vanishes everything they remember about eachother is gone too (I could accept the memories being removed, but the phone's diary too?). Also worth noting how the grandma, by the end of the movie, just casually mentions that the whole exchange bodies with a random person is normal and that her and her daugther experienced it too. Like WTF? You knew about this whole thing from the beginning and you let your grandchild go through it without at least warning that something like that might happen to her someday? There is also the part where she starts explaining how the time and events are like the strings they work with, and shit like that, in a poor attempt to explain what is going on. Overall it was kinda messy and the time-traveling part made it even more confusing, again, never explained.
Also another thing that annoyed me was how Taki didn't know the name of the town. He was supposed to have been living for at least a week or two (in days) on Mitsuho's body, I cannot believe he didn't remember or write down the name of the town, and because of this a good 10-15 minutes of the movie is spent on an stupid quest to find the town based on a drawing. In the case he just ""forgot"" about it, how is it possible that he can draw so well detailed the views of the lake of the town but can't remember a simple name??)
Overall: 8/10. Good visuals and VO, good enough main characters, very weak secondary cast, average story. I just wish they elaborated a bit more on the whole connection part, and showed more of their daily lives when they inhabit eachothers body, instead of doing an skip and just showing the stupid secondary cast go like ""woah dude, you were so weird yesterday"". SHOW ME WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED! Don't make me hear the vague descriptions of the stupid secondary cast or show a 10 seconds clip.",8,Synx7

                Kimi no na wa is probably one of the few animes id give a 10/10. This movie was a masterpiece to me and every second of it is enjoyable no matter how many times I've rewatched. The director of this movie is by far one of my favorites as his work always has the most beautiful animation and reality breaking plotlines. Like I said my overall rating for this movie was a 10/10 for anyone who hasnt seen it I wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to. My one problem with this movie was the characters. Not the fact they were unlikeable, theyre all great characters
                  who made the movie even better to watch. My problem was it really focused on mitsuha and not taki. By the end of the movie you know so much about her which isnt a bad thing it adds to the plot , but I think it would have been nice to know more about the male lead taki. Why was she switching with him out of all people? It would have been nice to know his importance to the movie rather than just Mitsuha's. Spoilers ahead, another small problem that just had me wondering what happened is in the end how did Mitsuha convince her dad to bring everyone to the school. Wasnt a problem that made me enjoy the movie less it was just a huh? moment. These small problems werent enough to bump down my school any less then a 10/10. The beautiful animation was just amazing and never gets less enjoyable to watch. The plot had interesting twists that made the movie worth watching more. My overall thoughts on this movie are I've never seen something like this or got absolutely hooked on an anime like this one let alone a movie. This movie was a masterpiece that could never get old.",10,mitsuhamiya

                I came to the cinema expecting nothing as i have seen before a lot of praise but also a lot of critics to it so i thought it would be ok at best. Damm i was wrong
Kimi no na wa is gorgeous, i was expecting a cheesy cute romance but it wasn't like that at all, it blew up my expectations.
The animation is the best i have seen to date (with koe no katachi there too) using a lot of photo-realistic scenarios and merging them with the animated scene in a beautiful way, sometimes i founded myself looking at the scenery more than the characters.
The
                  music its outstanding too, it fits perfectly the tone of the movie, and the songs i cant take them out of my head.
Now on the story and characters, the story could had been better but at least for me was still amazing because of the way it was done, they fitted all of that in 1hr and 46 min and i cant say enough how perfect the rhythm was. The characters, well besides our lovable protagonist there isnt to much to say, they didn't had that much screen time, not saying they were bad just underdeveloped.
Overall i can say my enjoyment was a 10/10, it was a rollercoaster of emotions the first lighthearted part made me laugh, but the second almost made me cry (i have never cry with anything but this was the closest) it was sad but also heartwarming

                Your Name is fun. Your Name is touching. Your Name is worth your time.
Art, Your Name is beautiful. Characters are drawn beautifully. Environments are drawn beautifully. Everything is animated amazingly. Your Name is eye candy and I've yet to find any budget spared on the visuals in this movie. Eating in a cafe, looking over a sunset, idling in a busy train, trekking up mountains, almost every single frame is wallpaper worthy.
Your Name dips its toes into time travel/timeline manipulation, and even if its inexplainable, the interaction between our couple is so touching, you'll (probably) excuse its execution. Speaking of interactions, Taki and Mitsuha's relationship
                  feels well deserved despite the two barely meeting face to face (if ever) in a relationship probably more long distance than proper long distance relationships.
The score is beautiful. Its subtle when it has to be subtle, bold when it needs it. RADWIMPS have orchastrated an impossibly fitting OST to convince you to feel how our characters are feeling. Some tracks in the album have been rated very highly in my Spotify playlist, they're absolutely amazing as just background music for your life in general.
Your Name combines anything, everything that would make an animation an amazing animation, and probably surpasses that bar to some.

This movie is good because it is simple, beautiful, easy to digest and that's what it makes it good.

                When I remember Makoto Shinkai's old masterpiece that named ""5 cm per seconds"". I was thinking if the ending of this anime would be sad. But it's not as I expected
When I see the ""Makoto Shinkai"" name as the director. I was thinking I will see the best graphic of the floor, table, sea, and the meteor as the main focus.
The role of ""RADWIMPS"" as the singer it's the best collaboration I think. I feel the beat of the ""Zen Zen Zense"" at the beginning of the anime.
The character drawing is good. I feel the match of the sky, building, and the water with the
                  character.

32281,"
                The story had so much potential and had me at the edge of my seat, and then just ripped me right out of the experience with a poorly placed song sequence that didn't fit the mood or flow of the scene. These songs made it feel like the movie was composed of short episodes with anime openings in between. This was my biggest issue with the movie. Other than that, the characters just felt like plot devices at times, having no consistency in the way they act and at times changing their entire personality at the drop of a hat. It felt like they were
                  doing things because they had to do them in order to advance the story. There was no reasoning behind it, but you could tell what they would do because that was where the story was going. 
Also, this one is a really small gripe but I hate the cliche of having a character act odd, then another character asks ""Who ARE you?"" as if nobody acts strange in real life. It's dumb and feels like an unnatural response every time I see it used.
Overall an enjoyable movie if you can look past everything I've said here, the animation is gorgeous and the story really is very good. For me the experience is just overshadowed by these small but numerous flaws.

                Kimi no Na wa is what I'd like to describe as a rollercoaster. One that you may have thought would be a nice, calm ride at first, but then slowly progressing into what no preview or summary could prepare you for - the most breath-taking ride in the entire theme park. I know that I'm 4 years late to the hype train, but I'll try to write the best spoiler-less review that I can manage.
Story - 10.
The storyline of Your Name is one that seems like your regular, magic-infused slice of life, but through the use of incredible pacing and sneaky foreshadowing evolves into something
                  much, much deeper. The fated lovers concept is one I have enjoyed very much in the past, so seeing this very interesting and innovative twist on it pulled me in immediately. Makoto Shinkai has definitely upgraded his storytelling from 'The Garden Of Words'.
Art - 7.
The character art and designs aren't my personal cup of tea. Usually I'd prefer style like that of 'Violet Evergarden' or 'Guilty Crown', but I do have to say that the scenery in this movie is absolutely awe-inspiring, so much so that it took what would have been a 3 all the way to a 7. If I remember correctly, the first time I saw the sky in Kimi no Na wa, I put whatever I was doing on hold and stared at it for about 10 minutes. A big congratulations to whoever animated this movie.
Sound - 9.
Your Name has a highly unique and diverse soundtrack. Songs like 'Dream Lantern' and 'Sparkle' take the front seat in order of importance, but the movie also has many great quality background songs too. You wouldn't usually notice them when you're indulged in the story, but they're there, and they're amazing.
Characters - 7.
While there wasn't anything particularly bad about the characters, I felt that was wasn't anything that stood out much either. That's not to say that the cast is full of one-note personalities, just regular tropes with regular actions.
Enjoyment - 9.
During my viewing I thoroughly enjoyed Kimi no Na wa. I felt happy when something good was happening, I felt angry at aggravating characters or bad decisions, I felt embarrassed when the characters where adapting to their new way of life, and I sobbed dramatically through the entire movie.
Overall - 10.
All in all, Your Name is a beautiful story, one that I will be telling and have already started telling all my friends to watch. The re-watch value is high, however I don't think I'll re-watch it more than twice, in fear of losing the abundance of emotions I felt watching it the first time round. I highly recommend this anime, and I hope you enjoy it!",10,kamado_tn

                Your name was one of the biggest Japanese animation movies to come out in the last decade. I am a huge fan of anime but I never really bothered to watch your name despite all the hype because of other commitments. The premise of the movie is ""Two teenagers share a profound, magical connection upon discovering they are swapping bodies. But things become even more complicated when the boy and girl decide to meet in person"". I finally decided to watch this movie and wanted to see if this movie was deserving of its hype.
Firstly, the animation and art style is so beautiful. Every shot
                  in this movie is visually striking and it is very clear that the director (Makoto Shinkai) and his team were thorough in the detail of Tokyo and the rural countryside. The setting of this movie is based on the real world but it is so gorgeous to look at, that it feels magical. Every little thing in this movie is just so visually pleasing from the skyscrapers to the forest to just the characters eating; it's stunning. This movie was definitely robbed by the Oscar for not even nominating the movie. 
The music is also done by a Japanese band call ""Radwimps"" and it is phenomenal. Their songs are perfectly utilised in the movie and perfectly represents and elevate the emotion of the scene. It's surprising because using vocal pop songs are usually jarring but Your Name does it in such an effective way that the scene wouldn't feel the same without it. 
The story within this movie sounds cliche with the body-swapping but the way it is executed is so fundamentally different from anything Hollywoods done that it feels unique. Mitsuha is the girl who lives in the rural countryside and is a shrine maiden but wishes to live in Tokyo. Taki is the boy who lives in Tokyo who is a talented artist aspiring to be an architect. They both end up randomly swapping bodies which results in them having to discover why this is happening but also learning about each other along the way. The situation leads to them dealing with each other problems but also discovering more about themselves. Mitsuha and Taki wouldn't interact normally but this event leads to them creating a bond where they both would be irreplaceable to one another. 
Romance movies are not something I am fond of but Your Name kept me emotionally invested in what was going on. There is some laugh out loud moments that are expected of body-swapping but there are some serious, suspenseful and even genuinely heartwarming moments that tug at my heartstrings. The director masterfully inserts these clashing tones and makes it fit together to complement each other.  There are some twist and unconventional ways to body-swapping done in this movie that sets it apart from other romance or body-swapping movies. On top of that, the characters are absolutely loveable with their quirky personalities. There is also supporting characters who are the friends of Mitsuha and Taki who are just the best people in the world. 
Overall, the movie is such a wild rollercoaster of emotions. There were so many moments where I was screaming internally because I was so invested in these characters and their situation. The constant message of searching for something or someone is the theme of the movie and it shouldn't resonate but it does. All of this leads to a satisfying finale that by the end I've felt rewarded. I've never been so engaged in a romance movie until Your Name. The fantastically beautiful animation that is weaved together with a very human story with likeable characters leads to what may be the best animation movie in the last decade. This was a sensational experience that everyone should experience themselves.",10,Soulwarfare

     This anime is basically what you would call an emotional roller coaster... If you can relate to it, which i had and I can say that watching this really made me regret all the mistakes I have made in the past, b/c it has an underlying theme that basically everything you do will matter, and the actions you base off of this can affect your life forever.
     The art I would say had a great impact on how the movie played, it gave me an old timey feel that I haven't felt since iv watch old
                  series, from around either early 2000s or 1990s, feel, but with a better graphics, not sure if im making sense but that's just how it seems to me.
   The music was literally the most captivating thing about the movie, because during it I was wondering how something that didn't seem to fit, fit so perfectly with the movie, it had pondered me the whole time, but added on to the movie in an emotional level
    The characters were so so, but as it went on you began to love them and their quirkiness, never have I cried from an anime, but these characters had made me cry, from the emotional prowess this anime supported them with(not sure if that made sense but going with it), these characters I connected with because after you have experienced loneliness you will know what they have went through, throughout the movie.

But enough of this, i need give this masterpiece a rating.
Animation: 9
The only reason that i didn't give this a pure 10 is because the animation is the same as in 5cm. This isn't a bad thing, far from it, it's beautiful. The colors bring everything to life, the trees, Tokyo, the picturesque city on the lake that seems like it just came out of a fairy tale. The animation is great, but i just had a few scenes here and there that seem they where taken from one of the previous movies.

Ok this movie has one the most well built characters that i saw in a long time. I would love to say why but i don't wanna to spoiler the story to anyone. You get to know the main two characters well, to bind whit them and fell there pain and joy. The support characters are also done well taking into consideration that this is a movie and really there just isn't the time to get to know everybody. 
Sound: 9
Mone Kamishiraishi was phenomenal as Mitsuha, Ryunosuke Kamiki on the other hand did have a bit of a strange high pitch thru some of the scenes. He did it for a reason but still it just annoyed me a bit. All in all voice acting was high class, well timed, emotional, realistic. 
Music: 10
Like i said at the beginning band RADWIMPS plays the music in the movie and it's soft, indie, jpop rock. It fits the movie perfectly, i might even end up buying there CD. So absolutely no objections there!

                Your Name is a movie that improves with further watches. While I enjoyed the film the first time I watched it, my enjoyment for it has only skyrocketed the more times I have REWATCHED it. That is because the film is so delicately crafted that you notice new details every time, and in a film twisted out of order with various time loops, it is always exciting upon rewatch figuring out where every scene fits in the general timeline of the movie.
But even without the rewatches, Your Name is a gem. The animation is breathtaking, the soundtrack is brilliant, and the story is craftily written
                  to hold onto your attention the entire time. Mitsuha and Taki are likeable and enjoyable, and the relationship that develops between them is believable. It takes no time at all to get invested into these characters' lives, and the shocking twist that occurs mid-way through the movie had my jaw drop open. I was heavily invested in this film the entire time (which can oftentimes be rare, since I'll find myself reaching for my phone about 30 minutes into a movie if the pace isn't picking up). The final act of the film is amazing as concepts introduced in a subtle manner in the beginning of the film intertwine with the characters' actions. 
*SPOILER BELOW*
Hearing that Shinkai is oftentimes famous for ""the one that got away,"" prior to watching this film, I was nervous to see how the conclusion would pan out, especially since Taki and Mitsuha slowly forget about each other. However, those last few minutes where they notice each other and are running through the train station are absolutely beautiful to watch and what draws me back to the film every time. The ending is left subtle, but in a way that you know it's a happy ending.
*SPOILERS END HERE*
As I mentioned above, I love rewatching this film, because I love a film that makes me think. Your Name improves the more you watch it, and I love looking back and noticing subtle details that link the timeline together. Yes, the film is told slightly out of order, but that's the fun of it, and once you've watched the film once, you'll be ecstatic to watch it again and notice all that you missed the first time.
I do not often give out 10s, but Your Name is a masterpiece, whether Shinkai wants to admit it or not. It is still one of my favorite anime movies to this day.",10,gingermemequeen

Your name is overrated. I will start this review with that, not because I wish to be hateful, but because it truly mean it. People have, in the past, compared this movie – as well as its writer, Makoto Shinkai – to the greatness of Miyazaki and its movies. After all, Your name DID beat spirited away at the box office... But this is, in my humble opinion, far from nearly the case. Makoto Shinkai isn't Miyazaki, and for numerous reasons. 
First of all, the characters aren't good. I mean, they're not bad either;
                  they're likable... At best. None of them really have debth nor insane caracterization, and most of them fall under your typical cliché characteristics without ever really exceeding them. Mitsuha is,well,she's an anime girl. Nothing more to it than that. She's girly and shy despite her strong personality, she gets over excited over food, she blushes 2/3 of the movie. We get I don't know how many jokes related to her chest, because what can you do she's an anime girl!, and oh yeah, she cuts her hair mid movie... She's the least original a character can get. She has some personal characterization, such as how she hates her life where she lives, or how her family's relationship with her father isn't doing well, but unfortunately the movie doesn't do a lot to develop those aspects of her character, and I believe it's a shame. Taki, on the other hand is surprisingly even more flat. He's... A boy, I guess. And he loves Mitsuha. I think the show did a grand mistake when focusing on the characterization of these two characters, because instead of actually developing the characters themselves, they instead chose to render what would, according to them, happen if a teenage boy ended up in a teenage girl's body and vice versa, and not what would happen if those two specific characters switched place: instead of writing good characters, they wrote a good situation. And that goes for the side characters as well. We've got the  ""mature, gorgeous senpai"" who is loved by the main character in the beginning, your typical ""male friends"", and your typical ""childhood friends duo"". Granted, these characters don't ruin the movie in any way, but they certainly aren't what makes it so adulated worldwide. It's something completely different. 
Maybe is it because of its story. I don't think it is only because of that, I don't even think it plays such a big role in people's appreciation overall... But I believe it does impact the overall opinion. The story is dream-like. It's a lovely love story between two chosen people separated by distance, and eventually we learn, by time itself... And by death. It's the story of finding back something you feel is missing from your life, it's a wonderful tale of how, if love there is, there will always be a path, a link. I guess this too, is musubi. The surnatural elements also play a massive role in this movie's story, where reality itself seems to arrange itself the way the plot wants it to be. Because no, nothing really makes sense in this movie. Why did they swap bodies in the first place? Because... Links and bonds leap through time and pass beyond reality, I guess. How did they meet on the Rocky hill despite literally being timelines appart from one another? Because twilight is the magic hour of the day, where miracles can happen or something. How did Saki witness all of mistuha's life? Because he drank her sake! Everything is vaguely explained at a point or another, but nothing really makes sense. It's magical, and supposed to stay that way, but that's just another way to name plot conveniences. And speaking of that, there's a lot. How could they never have seen the date written anywhere in town, in Tokyo, or at school? I don't know about you, but I used to write everyday on my notebook or at the top of assignments, just because that's how you're supposed to do. The same way, the fact mistuha's friends accept to literally bomb the city to make everyone evacuate just because she came to you one day, and said that you were all going to die without any proof whatsoever... Is beyond me. I get it, they're good friends, but there is a limit to credulity. The same way, how was mitsuha able to convince her dad in the end? It should have been an important scene, the scene where she finally stands up to her father after all this time, where she convinces him to, for once, believe her, his daughter. And it's skipped. And we're lead to believe she managed to convince him the comet was going to kill all of them, despite professionnals repeatedly telling you there was no danger. It's... Very unfortunate, and if you ask me, that should have been one of the most important scenes of the movie. But it was skipped. So to summarize, the story is beyond magical as long as you don't think too hard about it. Or, as long as you don't think about it at all... That's even better. But as I said, I don't even think that's the major reason why people like this movie. Instead, it's because of something much more sinister. 
People like kimi no na wa because of its animation. That's literally it. Anyone mentioning this movie will, at least once, mention how great it looks, because it's this animation that made them turn off their brain on the span of nearly two hours in order to appreciate this movie without thinking about anything other than ""the animation"". And yes, it's gorgeous, it's a free wallpaper-worth exposition of pictures all along, but that's just not the way you should judge a movie. You can't say a movie is good just because it's pretty, you shouldn't judge anything on looks alone... Yet in this case, I'm convinced this movie wouldn't nearly have done as well as it did without it's curse of an animation, and it's a fact I'm sure most of you will agree with. 
And similar to that, the music was perfectly fine and catchy, in fact, I think the songs in it are some of my favorites of the genre, but just because the music is good doesn't mean it's a good soundtrack. They put a catchy J-Pop rock song during the scene where a giant meteorite crashes upon earth and... Destroys an entire city. Well yes, it made the scene even more good-looking, but was that the best choice of music? I doubt so. Princess monoke has, according to me, the best original soundtrack of any movie I have ever seen, and it's because of how much you can tell about this movie just by listening to it's tracks. Music says more than words in these cases, but in the case of your name? All it leaves the viewer with is a dreadful feeling of blind joy upon how pretty what they saw was. And this is how you diferenciate a masterpiece from ""a movie you simply love"". This, is what kimi no na wa really is. Everyone's guilty pleasure, until it becomes widely acknowledged as ""great"" to the eyes of everyone, when it really isn't on the level of other, true masterpieces out there. 
But I'm not in a good place to criticize this mindset. I have watched this movie more times that it takes to know it by heart, and I can guarantee I, too, was blinded by it's divine looking. And, in a way, I still am. What I find interesting is that Makoto Shinkai himself admitted it was a flawed movie he didn't have the time to finish the way he wanted it to. He didn't want an Oscar for a movie that he personally didn't think as ""complete"", he didn't want to be called the next Miyazaki for a movie that he judged unworthy of being watched. Makoto Shinkai is a great animator, and I can guarantee you 5cm per second, she and her cat, weathering with you, and almost all of his movies/short stories are great, better than your name in some regards. But your name... Was unfinished. Everything that they managed to pull off of this movie, is the animation, the story, and the emotions. In the end, it makes for a truly shallow movie that you like because you like it, but not because it's good. And in the end, if this is all there is to the movie, isn't this what you should judge it on? Characters are essential, but if there isn't anything to see in the characters, what can you say about it? To prove that: you can more than love this movie without great characters. And you can re-watch it as many times as you want and still fall in love with it despite it's lack of interesting characters. So who am I to complain? Sure, I would have loved for your name to be finished in the end, but if we can love it despite its flaws, it should be fine right? 
Your name is not a good movie. It's a movie you love,and it's two very distinct things. Therefore,it's overrated, but is it overliked? No, it's not. This is what makoto shinkai's movies generally aspire to be. Sure, most of them have more than entertainment value to them, but they're generally movies you appreciate, rather than movies you find well written. This is why makoto shinkai will never be Miyazaki: because he isn't, in fact, Miyazaki. He aspires to another kind of movies, and I'm all up for it. In the case of your name? It's only good for what it is. Like it as much as you want, because this is all it will ever allow you to.",8,I--was

                Through a structural lens, this movie is essentially perfect. The conflicts, character arcs, and reveals are perfectly timed and the suspense are textbook perfect. But story-wise, I have something else to say. This idea, you know what I mean if you've watched it, makes me just shiver with stress. The sadness that ensues from this tragic idea is incredible. It is unparalleled in concept. And its executed in a way that every story-beat is just so gripping. 
My issues come from the ending. My boy didn't stick the landing. There were 2 options, a sad ending or a happy one. You should not be choosing
                  anything but the extremes. Problem is, this movie goes for a subtle ending. It is neither. If you're too sentimental you'll get a high, but after the intense suspense that's been raging for like 15 minute, I expect more. It wasn't a stupid ending. It just had SO much potential that was missed. I can see the writers considering what I said and choosing this subtle one instead, as it more fits with the style of this movie, but DAMN. A more triumphant or depressing ending could have changed the whole scope of this movie to basically the emotional heights of Tenki No Ko.
Really sappy and incredibly crafted. I'd feel like a fool if I didn't go 9. Masterful work here.",9,GodfreyKrown

                Finally got a chance to watch this. This is my first ever review so take it lightly on me hehe.
Ever since I got back into watching Anime once again after a few years on 31 December 2016, when I first created this account a day after, this was the movie that I was recommended to from many of my friends. Though I got busy at the time, since I was finally free to watch it (with having a good friend of mine as company) these are my thoughts from this movie.
Story: 10/10
The story is really simple, one day out of nowhere, our main characters, Taki
                  and Mitsuha, switching bodies constantly. Due to this sort of mystery, they set off to find each other and it really turned into an adventure that is unforgettable for me. The simple story may turn confusing halfway through, but it managed kept its simplicity of the main characters trying to find their purpose in the current situation they were currently in. The work put into the story is not always easy for me to place a 10/10 rating, but due to its simplicity and allowing ""lost"" people like me to understand the purpose in this movie, I can say that it is a 10/10 rating for me.
Art: 10/10
This may be a short section I will be writing on. The art of this movie blew my mind when I was watching the movie. It not only focused on just 1 location, but the movie managed to pull it off by bringing along 2 locations and placing both the main characters into each location. The areas shown in the movie made me feel a sense of relation as the locations show the people's way of living in each places. Not only that, but it also shows the culture of each locations which I am always excited to see. I believe the amount of effort put into the Art is what made me happy to say that it can safely land a 10/10 rating.
Sound: 10/10
The sound section is always an interesting aspect for me. Let's get into it. The soundtracks and all has gave me goosebumps throughout the whole movies. That includes the credits. It managed to give a sense of accompaniment with me as it allows me to be able to relate to the character's feelings as such. Because of this, (and also making me emotional during certain parts), I can say it lands a 10/10 rating.
Character: 10/10
Ah the characters, for Taki and Mitsuha, the way they were played out was outstanding. They managed to make me relate to their actions, feelings and characteristics pretty much. As for the side characters, such as Mitsuha and Taki's friends, Mitsuha's family, I'm surprised that they paid so much attention to these characters by having them interact to the main characters most of the time and has managed to play an important part in the main characters stories. As for the bystanders, such as the crowd in each different locations, I'm happy to see that they were also given roles. What roles? Roles like showing what it is like each day to wake up and go to either work, school and such. They are also an important aspect for me as it allows me to see what it is like to be in that city, what it is like everyday pretty much. For that, it lands a 10/10 rating.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Kinda short, but enjoyment is a safe full 10/10 rating because the movie perfectly executes events at the right moment, at the right time. Important parts managed to keep me on the edge of my seat, confusing parts got me wondering and made me excited and want to try and solve the mysteries before the characters do, and emotional parts had me reaching for the tissue (no my friend did not just like stare at me crying XD) Therefore, it easily lands a 10/10 for me.
Overall: 10/10
After all of this, I can say that Kimi No Na Wa is an amazing movie with a rollercoaster of emotions and excitement. It lives up to its expectations and therefore is why I'm happy to say that this movie earns its 10/10 rating as it managed to win me over and I'm satisfied that I'm finally able to watch this movie. I'd definitely re-watch again when I have the chance.",10,RepliKaXe

                Your Name (君の名は)
My rating: 10/10
MAL Rating: 9.12/10
THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE MOVIE YOUR NAME, IF YOU HAVE NOT YET WATCHED THE MOVIE THEN PLEASE DO BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW.
I’m sure my score isn’t unexpected with this movie, it’s already highly agreed upon around the globe that this movie is a gem to the anime and animation industry, reaching unbelievable heights in terms of the skill and technicality used in it’s visually stunning animation and the love and care taken by Makoto Shinkai (新開誠(the writer and original creator of the book and film)) to make this experience the greatest it can possibly be. And it
                  shows. Looking past the slightly incoherent story which, at many time, didn’t make a whole lot of sense, every other aspect of Your Name is simply breathtaking. The beautiful visuals; the emotionally striking soundtrack; and the incredibly powerful voice acting all add up to make this an unbelievably enjoyable watch. 
The story starts by following a short snippet in the daily life of Country girl and female protagonist Mitsuha Miyamizu (voiced by the impeccable Kamishiraishi Mone), the daughter of a currently running Japanese politician and a woman who has always dreamed of a life in the big city of Tokyo as she grows increasingly more tired with her current life in the countryside. She’s a polite and well mannered person, who continuously helps her local town out with traditional Japanese festivals and celebrations. 
Mitsuha, in my opinion, is one of the more fleshed out characters in the film, having her morals develop well from the “dreaming of a city life” mindset, to a need to help everyone around her who she loves as much as possible, fueled by her interactions with male protagonist Taki Tachibana where, even in a completely alien, city life environment; even in a completely different body; even in a completely different life, she still strives to be as kind to those around her as possible and aid people’s lives as much as she can. I’ll tell you right now, I don’t think I could stay so calm in her situation, could you? 
The next part of the film follows male protagonist Taki Tachibana (voiced by the amazing Kamiki Ryunosuke), a city bred school boy who spends his days doing art, working and just getting through his daily life. His world, honestly, is uninspired, he lacks the motivation to strive for anything in life other than to just have a decent time. He’s a kind and well mannered guy but, with a slight persistent-ness behind it when he wishes to be so. However, after his interaction with Mitsuha, a girl with a similar behaviour to him just, with a completely different life, he starts to become interested in the body swapping phenomenon and the countryside town she lived in as a whole. He so badly wanted to go and meet her, that was until... 
WARNING: SPOILERS FOR THE CLIMAX OF YOUR NAME, IF YOU IGNORED THE SPOILER ABOVE THEN HERE’S ANOTHER ONE. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK. 
A large reference that is made throughout the film is toward an event where a large meteor is scheduled to strike across the Japanese skies, everyone is incredibly excited for this to occur however, after the meteor split and destroyed an entire town, this event was labelled as a disaster. This is when Taki discovers something, that town which was destroyed 3 years prior, was the one in which Mitsuha lived in and he walked around during his body swapping experiences. They were switching through time as well. Mitsuha had been dead for 3 years. The rest of the movie follows the reconnection of the 2 souls and the saving of the towns population, with the 2 protagonists experiencing a variety of different obstacles which try to prevent them from saving everyone.
For as emotional as this part of the movie can get, I also feel like the introduction of a time travel element adds such a large amount of confusion on an average viewer and presents many inconsistencies in Shinkai’s writing. It definitely works but, I feel like it could’ve been tackled in a different way so that viewers wouldn’t be so confused and left In the dust by the plot speeding by at a million miles an hour.
Overall, I really enjoyed this film, it presented itself so wonderfully and in a way that I’d never seen before and, dispute how low rated the story is, it definitely managed to tug on my heart strings more times than I can count. Thank you to CoMix Wave Films, who created this amazing animated experience and a MASSIVE thank you to Makoto Shinkai, who gave life to such a masterpiece of a movie. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it and I’m looking forward for more of Shinkai’s work in the future.",10,Fakemilia

                Sitting at my desk, waiting to return to college… I’ve been indolent so far this summer. I remember setting lofty goals for myself after finishing my finals. I told myself that in the three months I would have ample time to recharge, do some exercise, get more reading (and anime watching, of course), etc. I would begin the next year a new man.
Sitting at my computer, having just finished watching Kimi no Na wa., I realize that the decisions I make today, tomorrow, every day for the rest of my life are as crucial to the world as anyone else’s. Had my parents made different
                  decisions, I could be living in a completely different environment. My entire outlook on life could be different. Who I am right now would be different -- heck, my very name could be different.
Watching Kimi no Na wa., I was struck by the sheer visual clarity. Being accustomed to the relatively lackluster animation of TV series that due to their length can’t be crystal clear, I was blown away by the attention to detail, the almost photographic level of realism that made me believe I wasn’t dreaming, I wasn’t merely watching an anime movie, I was taking a glimpse into two people’s lives. The beauty of the artwork gave everything happening in the movie an almost surreal quality, as if life, as if the world of Kimi no Na wa. itself, were that beautiful. Looking away from the screen, I realize that the real world can be beautiful, as long as you're looking at it in the right way.
This wondrous world we live in is enormous. There are so many unique pockets of life. As we see in Kimi no Na wa., life in a bustling city is so vastly different from life in a rural countryside. The spectrum of human life has a myriad array of colors, each bright and sparkling in its own way. When two different colors meet, it is as if magic occurs at the confluence.
What am I even saying? I can’t do full justice to this movie… all I can do is wipe away my tears, and keep on searching for something, for someone. To find that beautiful quality of life.",10,Jusaku-Redai
32281,"
                This is a great movie.
For some reason, I watched Tenki no Ko before Kimi no Na wa. I had thought that Tenki no Ko was good (great in terms of Art and Animation) but majorly pretentious. For that reason, I had developed some preconceptions about Makoto Shinkai and was not too eager to see this movie.
However, there is no (very little) pretense in this movie. It is a heart throbbing at moments and cheerful at others with no sudden transitions. The way the movie flows is exceptional. No scene felt forced to me unlike Tenki no Ko.
Art and design is the best there is.
                  Attention has been given to miniscule details and the color palette is not depressing (like it was for Tenki no Ko).
I know I have pretty much compared the movie to Tenki no Ko. But now I finally understand that it was an attempt to reproduce the magic of Kimi no Na wa.",10,eliecher
32281,"
                Even with all the flaws, it's hard to not give the movie a 10. 
After I bought into the premise and the characters, and keeping in mind Shinkai's habit of separating his characters, the ending of Kimi no Na Wa left me in such an emotional high that everything is forgiven. 
Perhaps it's why the movie is so successful. People who enjoy it for what it is instead of picking it apart to judge its worth as the ""best anime ever"" will recommend it to their friends without hesitation, regardless of whether they are anime fans. 
If you haven't watched it, my suggestion is to
                  ignore the hype, forget the fact that it's rated so high, stifle your inner critic, and enter with a blank slate of mind. If you can emotionally invest in the characters -- not difficult to do, as Taki and Mitsuha are so naturally written and voice-acted -- the payoff is incredible.

This anime is fucking beautiful. Art is just top notch. Sound is fantastic. Story is very interesting. It's just an overall 10 for me.
Although it may be my fault, I couldn't understand why they switched bodies, or how. Maybe that was purposely left blank. Maybe I missed it. But this is a very small issue I had. The overall story and movie trumps over this issue like nothing.

                This movie is a beautiful looking cliché movie. Your Name is a movie that is supposed to make you feel for the characters and feel all these sort of emotions that coincide with a romance anime. But this movie doesn’t give me any sort of feeling for the characters and how they are meant to save the girl and her town before it gets destroyed and kills everyone. I really had wanted to like this movie but I couldn’t.
The Story: 2.
The story of Your Name is unique concept but that doesn’t change that it’s a clichéd mess of a story. The Main male, Taki, has
                  to save this girl, Mitsuha, and her town, Itomori, from a comet that crashed into the town but Taki and Mitsuha change bodies. Even with how neat the description sounds, Your Name just wasn’t able to keep up with it and relied too much on the romance aspect of the movie for way too long. It got good towards the end when they actually helped save Mitsuha and the whole town’s people but then they ruined it by having a cliché ending, Taki and Mitsuba meet up once again and then Taki gives back Mitsuba’s yarn, He could have worked the ending to be less clichéd but he didn’t.
The Art: 8
The artwork in this movie is really good. It’s drawn, coloured and animated super well and it’s so beautiful. The production quality of this movie is very good and the choice of colours is phenomenal. 
The Sound: 7
The sound quality of this movie is really good. And the band RADWIMPS did a really great job on the music for this movie. The soundtrack is a very very good and was the most enjoyable part of this movie.
The Characters: 4
The Characters of this movie, They bothered me for most of the time watching this movie. Taki just felt like a creep during most of this movie, especially when he starts looking for her and the town where she lived all to find out her name so he could meet her. Mituha was a nice character who actually seemed to care about what was gonna happen and seemed really excited to go to Tokyo when she changed bodies with Taki. The characters that joined along side of Mitsuha, during her while trying to save the town, were just so annoying and forgettable. 
In the end, In my Opinion, Your Name doesn’t deserve all the hype that it has gotten over the 4 years since it was released. The story is just your typical romance, drama anime with no real weight in the Genre. The Art and sound were the best parts of the movie but even so, it doesn’t change the fact of a lackluster movie. The Characters were mostly just annoying and the least interesting part of the movie was the main part of Your Name, the Romance. The Romance between Taki and Mituha was just so damn boring and just a pointless part of the movie. It's a 3/10 for me",3,Arisu_24

                Your name
Visuals and sounds: We know what Shinkai likes to do aesthetically. The only film Shinkai didn’t nail in that aspect was Voices Of A Distant star, but this one is magnificent in both aspects. The backgrounds, characters and facial expressions are astounding and the sounds immerse you in the atmosphere. 5/5 and 5/5.
Characters: The characters on this film are one of the best crafted ones I’ve seen so far, we get to know the main characters outstandingly well. And the secondary/support characters don’t just exist – they have a role and a well-developed personality as well.
The way the emotions are conveyed is simply flawless;
                  the director is really good at making realistic characters. 30/30.
Grip: Your Name lasts nearly 2 hours; however, it didn’t feel like that much time. Throughout the whole movie something interesting is happening, especially at the end and beginning, and apart from being entertaining, it is quite emotional. Magnificent job. 5/5.
Message: I don’t even know where to begin. This movie has analysis potential galore, a plethora of symbolism and consequently a strong message about destiny and life. I can’t fathom how I managed not to cry while watching it.
The plot conveys the message perfectly; the actions and colloquies could be compared as two people dancing in perfect sync. This film left me speechless. 30/30.
Complexity and analysis potential: The time travel element is sometimes hard to keep track of, but there’s a good amount of Japanese culture symbolism. 19/20.
Length: 1 hour and 56 minutes is a lot of time, but watching this movie, it’s time well-spent. 5/5.

_______________________________________________________________________________________
Ever since I got into anime (about the beginning of this year), your name had always been a name I had heard. In the comments of a Reddit post or a youtube video, it was everywhere. Everyone said that it was amazing, and I had heard that it beat spirited away as the number one highest grossing anime film, with 358 million dollars worldwide. I knew I needed to watch it, but it wasn’t until one instance that my interest got to the level where I wanted to buy the DVD as fast as possible. 
In
                  music class one day, our task was to make a cover of a song. But the problem was that I couldn’t make a cover if I knew how to play it already, but every song I was interested in playing on the piano, I had already started playing. I wasn’t sure what to do one of, so I searched for piano synthesias on youtube. It was a way to learn piano song quite quickly if you knew what you were doing. I scrolled for a while but never found anything, until I saw the synthesia for Sparkle. I listened to it, and it was perfect. I found the music video for the soundtrack, and I fell in love with it. The animation, the music, it was all perfect. I needed to see the movie, now that I had seen a demo of it. So a short time after that I bought the DVD an when it came I waited until the weekend when I could watch it. When Friday finally came and I watched the movie, I was utterly amazed at everything. The animation, the music (that I hadn’t heard before), the story and the movie in general. It gave me a feeling that I hadn’t felt before, or ever since. It was the first movie I was sad that I couldn’t watch for the first time again. Since then I have seen the movie 5 times, and my opinion has changed a tiny bit every time. But now the fifth time, I think I got an opinion on the movie. 
Before watching the movie I already knew that the music was going to be amazing. I only knew one song, yes, but the impression I got from it was that the band worked really hard on the OST, and you can tell. This soundtrack is honestly my favorite one ever. I think there were two songs in the entire OST that I didn’t like, the rest were all amazing. And to think that only one band worked on the OST is hard to believe. But something I didn’t expect was how the animation felt like a music video for the soundtrack (can’t take credit for that, Gigguk was the one that pointed it out). I heard that Shinkai changed the storyboard so that the music would fit in with the animation better, and you can tell. The songs would start at the perfect moment, it would change with the animation and stop when the animation needed it to be. Very few movies or shows do this, or at least so that you can tell. 
Speaking of animation, oh man was it good. Other than how good it fit in with the music, it was just amazing in general. It felt like every shot could be a background. There was no money saving so they could spend more on other scenes, cause every shot was as detailed as the other. It never took you out of the world, cause it put you into it. And even compared to other Shinkai movie, I still think this one was the best. Cause it felt like they could show the viewer what they could do with the ”fantasy” (I don’t know if I should call it that, but anyway) elements. It also had some very recognizable character designs, where you can remember very small side-characters just from their design. They showed a lot of character. The main characters fit in with the time period and location. Mitsuha looks like a person who lives outside of the city, and Taki looks like the opposite. The side-characters also have great designs and all look unique and show characters. And in the end, when they show the characters 5 years later, you can see how the character development changes how they look. Mitsuha and Taki both look more serious and modern, as do the other side-characters. 
Now to the story. I found this concept to be very unique, something I haven’t seen before. That two people change their lifes every other day. That might seem like something forgettable, but the way they use the concept, I found really fascinating. How they don’t try to find out why it’s happening but keep it a mystery. That way, the movie can spawn a conversation with more subjects, which is always good. They touch a little on the people who got the same experiences, but nothing more. 
I also like how the experiences change the characters where you really see the differences, and even in the end, there’s still a lot of change. That’s something that the movie did really well, using the characters in an interesting way. Cause we get to see how they live a life that contradicts their own one. So you get to see, for example, Mitsuha seeing how stressful it is for Taki who works for a restaurant, something she kind of asked for the day before. But after we get to learn about the characters, the more serious side of the movie begins. And something the movie does right is that they don’t change tone too fast, but slow so that the tones doesn't clash. So they start by doing something that makes the viewer curious, and when we learn what happened, that’s where the movie gets serious. 
The movie also has a lot of rewatchability. Cause even though you already know what’s going to happen, that’s why it’s fun to rewatch, cause there are so many hints of what’s going to happen that you don’t see at first. Like Yotsuha asking why her grandma still haven’t gotten over what their father did before we know what he did. That way, the dialogue feels way more realistic. 
Yes, there are things that I wasn’t a huge fan of. The second scene was a little confusing, the characters reaction to Taki or Mitsuha not knowing what happened the day before were a little mild sometimes (but most times it felt really realistic), some exposition scene that could have been solved through visuals and some out-of-character moments. But I feel like the movie makes up for that by having so many details that make the story so much interesting and consistent. 
At the end of the day, you can think whatever you want about this movie. I have seen videos of people hating the movie, and they had good points. But to me, this is the movie I find to be the closest to perfection I have ever seen, and it is the reason why I have seen it so many times. If you haven’t seen it yet, please do.

                After watching ''Koe no Katachi'' i wanted to continue watching anime in that genre and ''Kimi no Na wa'' was coming up on the similar list so i decided to give it a try, and im happy i did. 
The art was beautiful, the characters were all likeable and the soundtrack helped with the immersion during important scenes. 
I cant really fault much about this movie except that i wish we could have had more scenes that showed their love begining to blossom. I wasnt sure how i felt about the ending but after a few hours letting the whole story digest in my mind
                  i felt satisfied.
I think this would have made an amazing series rather than a movie, as more time could have been spent on character development and the whole idea of body swapping would have given lots of story potential and laugh out loud scenes.",9,DiesSomnium

                First of all I've never written a review before so I'm sorry if I mess up or don't do something correctly. :3
Plot/Story: 3
Okay, to be honest I absolutely hated the plot, there was hardly any interesting and phenomenal story to it and it was extremely boring. It felt like the same things were happening over and over and over again which started getting a bit eh- I personally think the story was overrated. 
They didn't properly explain why they were switching bodies and what caused them to switch like why these specific people it could have been anyone else, but he was chosen to switch
                  with her. 
Art/Animation: 8
On the other hand art was absolutely beautiful while the animation is just your standard animation you see in most animes, but aside that all the colours really complimented each other nicely and the scenery was drawn beautifully
Sound: 9
The sound was good and the sound track that you usually hear really went well with the movie.
Characters: 5
The character development in this anime was absolute garbage in my opinion, the biggest character development type thing we learnt was that the girl was already dead and has been for a few years which wasn't very surprising. I can't even remember what development the boy had apart from him having a job and going to school.

I didn't enjoy this movie at all, at the start it was okay, but the story shouldn't have been needed to be told in a almost 2 hour movie when it could have been told in about an hour and a few minutes, I personally think this movie was hyped up to much for what it is. 
Overall I give this movie a 4 because it is definitely watchable and the animation/art  makes up for the horrible plot and character development.

                A body swapping romance film, something I never knew I wanted.
This movie is just incredible, it is one of the first anime movies I ever watched and wow it set such a high bar. It is so incredibly beautiful, any frame of this film could be a wallpaper and it only took me until my third watch to start picking up on the plot holes and question marks. I still give this a perfect rating for it's ability to distract my mind from my heart.
I bought into the connection, I felt genuine stress and believe this is a movie that could make, even a heartless
                  person, get watery eyes.
10/10 from me, although I do shave a point off of character for Taki's slightly less developed character, but it was just a case of ""can we get 5 more minutes of his story"" and didn't impact my viewing pleasure at all.",10,JoshVanAlden

                Makoto Shinkai, Director of Kimi no Na Wa is a big name around anime movie industry. Perhaps because works like this his name becomes big. if anything about his work is that he never fail to deliver a good story even with something cliche. but i wont making hassle about cliche, i mean it is 2016 and what could possibly new?
Story 8/10 
the story is good,very good. it is a story which makes me not  playing with my phone while it is on. it is a story which make your eyes glued on it. but i agree if someone gonna say it is good
                  at best and decent at worse for the story. what i really amazed of Kimi no Na Wa is how great the story being delivered to audience . i understand that this show focused on ""feelings"" , and it does great job to convey it into audience. 
Art 8/10
It is candy to the eye . but i think it could do more 
Sound 10/10 
It is candy to the ear. it tease your ear. it caresess your ear. there are tunes here and there which done a great job conveying feelings on the show. they really know how to turn the mood on.
Enjoyment 10/10
knowing Makoto Shinkai mean knowing his ""fetish"" for making story which makes you linger and insecure , i feel restless as the show goes on to the end. if anything, i really glad of Kimi no Na Wa ending.  recent anime movie which i watch is Kizumonogatari Tekketsu Hen (bakemonogatari series) and Kotonoha ni Wa, while i got biased over Kizumonogatari because i am fans of bakemonogatari series, i really enjoy watching those both so does Kimi no na Wa. 
Overall 9/9
i have a great doubt when i first seen MAL rating for Kimi no Na Wa, it is over 9000 (9) ?!. when the shows over, i feel something weird in my chest . i am amazed of how it have affect what i feel inside my heart. this week is really busy , gotta prepare for my upcoming undergraduate exam and my paper still a mess. but then after i watch Kimi no Na Wa i feel somewhat refreshed  and having my fighting spirit recharged. it really is something nice to watch, no ! if you ever come to MAL and read this review that means YOU absolutely must watch Kimi no Na Wa.",9,Deathraz0r

                If you see some of the top review you'll probably realise that some people really like(10) and some don't(5-3). I'm not going to talk about the movie(there is already a lot of review about it).
If you're planning to watch it I recommended to just enjoy the story and watch it like you're watching a movie not an anime. The story can be easily understand by normal people
If you're someone who have watch tons of anime then probably this movie is 'okay-ish'. Because most anime relied on unique character like Oregairu or unique background like Youkoso.
Because this is originally a movie not a TV series. You
                  don't have a lot of time to develop a complex character and the most important is the story have to be easily understood by normal people.

                [STORY: 4/10]
The story was kind of interesting and had surprising turns, but nothing mindblowing or very original. Some parts can be incredibly slow or boring, but overall you will have a cinematic experience through other means, as the story itself does not carry this movie.
[ART: 10/10]
The visuals are truly amazing. Everything from the animation to the detail of the world we're presented with, it really is a spectacle to behold. You may never see another animated movie that looks as good as this one unless you're watching a Ghibli film or another of Makoto Shinkai's works.
[SOUND: 7/10]
Sound effects and music are solid and the voice
                  actors fit and do very well in their roles. Not much else to say here, it was just quality work.
[CHARACTER: 3/10]
This is where the movie really lacks. The only dynamic character I can think of is Mitsuha, as the others just feel undercooked or placed there to serve as fillers to make the world feel real and believable, even the other main character, Taki. If this department was more focused on, this movie would easily be much better.
[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 5/10]
While this movie has outstanding visuals and solid audio, the actual story and characters bring it down in the end. The characters and story aren't very original or creative, leaving me wondering why this movie is so praised. I""m guessing the visuals, but you could watch ""Byousoku 5 Centimeter"" or ""Kotonoha no Niwa"" by the same director and have a better experience that shares the same visual excellence this movie has. Even if this movie is extremely overrated, it is still an alright movie, and if you haven't seen many anime or even movies in general, you will likely enjoy this.",5,risinglazarus

                I've not really watched too many Anime Movies, but I have seen my fairshare of regular anime. And I can say for sure that Kimi no Na wa is one of the most beautiful anime's ever. I would recommend it in a heartbeat to anyone who enjoys anime, the story was beautiful, the music was phenomenal. After it finished and the credits was on the screen i had to sit there for a while to grasp everything that had happened. I love this movie so much. If you enjoy romantic anime with a good story then this is one for you to watch.

                I don't understand the hype, but I don't understand the hate either.
To be honest, this film being the highest rated anime is ridiculous. Shinkai has made better films, not counting everyone else. He's at his best when he keeps his stories grounded firmly in reality, in my view at least.
As you'd expect, the film looks amazing, not quite Garden of Words standard, but pretty special.
The story follows the well-used trope of body switching, but takes it in a surprisingly fresh direction, throwing in some tension towards the end of the story.
The characters are generic high schoolers who don't really stand out from every other high
                  school characters in anime.
Although, the end did have me pleading for it no to be a carbon copy of the 5cm Per Second ending (people who have seen that will know what I mean). Hence, it does have a satisfying ending.
If you are wondering ""why all the hype?"" about Makoto Shinkai, it is better to look elsewhere to see why, but he has done inferior things. As a result, this is well worth watching.",8,Otaku1985

It's beautiful in artwork and soundtrack and it's a amazing story with enough questions to make it keep your attention but not utterly confuse you. The ending was perfect, anymore and it would've been redundant. I loved the artwork and there was many opportunities for backgrounds. I felt the pacing was amazing for this and it really hit your feelings, plus it was relatable to that feeling of looking for something.

                Ever since its conception, storytelling has been used as a means of escapism. With its characters and settings brought to life in another reality, we are able to be transported from our everyday lives into something more spectacular. At its core, Your Name is all about this idea of escape. From its whimsical storyline to its otherworldly atmosphere, the entire movie feels like a fantastical dream. And an absolutely incredible one at that.
STORY - 8.2/10
While it takes place in the very real setting of modern-day Japan, the story is packed with supernatural elements. Just like a dream, you start off not really knowing what’s going
                  on. But soon enough everything starts to naturally unfold, managing to consistently maintain interest in its entire 2 hour runtime. There are also some really well done plot twists and moments of tension littered throughout, which I honestly wasn’t expecting from a high school romance movie. On top of all that, there’s a solid layer of depth that explores our connections with the world and the people around us. There are of course some minor flaws, like how explanations for the supernatural elements are mostly brushed over. But while it’s nothing groundbreaking, Your Name’s storyline is definitely a fascinating one from beginning to end.
CHARACTERS - 6.5/10
If there’s a weak link in this movie, it’d have to be the characters. They aren’t bad; in fact the personalities and interests of the two leads Mitsuha and Taki are explored quite well in the beginning of the movie. But there’s really not much depth to those personalities, which leads to some shallow character development from both. Similarly, the supporting characters feel just like supporting characters - nothing much more than devices to move the plot forward. Having said all that, the movie somehow manages to really make us care about its characters. It’s tons of fun to see them go through dreamlike journeys of their own, much like the audience’s own dreamlike experience when watching. Their feelings start to become your feelings. Their desires become your desires. This was especially true for me near the end of the movie, where I wished with every fiber of my being for a happy ending for the characters.
ART - 9.8/10
Though its story is largely supernatural, through its visuals is where Your Name truly leaves the boundaries of reality to become something else. The hand-drawn art is stunning, and every single frame of the movie is more than wallpaper worthy. The animation is buttery smooth, with everything flowing, bouncing, or panning in the most satisfying way possible. The cinematography is breathtaking, utilizing ultra wide shots to create a massive sense of scope and beauty. And the movie is filled with visual symbolism in every nook and cranny, adding even more meaning to an already rich story. All of these aspects combine together in the best way possible to create a dreamlike atmosphere nothing short of ethereal.
SOUND - 8.7/10
The soundtrack only helps add to the atmosphere, beautifully complimenting every scene that its used in. Some tracks that particularly stand out are “Sparkle”, “Zenzenzense”, and “Again to Goshintai”, all of which give me chills on demand. A minor complaint is that the soundtrack mostly just sounds pretty without adding much meaning to the story or its characters, but its still plenty enough to elevate the entire movie to a higher level of emotion. There are also some great sound effects that really help add to certain scenes, like a dramatic bell or a chorus of wailing whales. There’s a particularly amazing scene which uses complete silence to turn something already spectacular into a borderline masterpiece. And as you’d expect from a fairly high budget movie like this, the voice acting is on point and does not at all detract from the immersion.
OVERALL ENJOYMENT - 9.2/10
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, this movie feels exactly like a beautiful dream. Every time I watch it, I feel truly disconnected from the real world and absorbed into one more beautiful, innocent, and happy. And at the end of the day, that’s exactly why I watch anime, go to movies, listen to music, or consume any type of media - to feel a sense of happiness that I often can’t get from reality. And in this sense, Your Name is an overwhelming success. So take it all in, and let this dream leave some of its beauty behind in your reality.",9,MidnightSerpent

Story: -
I cannot rate the story of this anime, it's one of those kinds of anime to me, almost like clannad. Although I can say I was sucked into the story, I can't say I can really rate it any number. Not that it's bad by any means.
Art: 10
The art is the highlight of this anime to me, the character
                  designs, the backgrounds, just every little thing is packed with so much detail. Possibly some of the best art I've seen.
Sound: 10
All the soundtracks are very catchy and pleasing to the ears. I'd even consider purchasing an OST, although I think there's only a few songs in the actual movie.
Character: 10
The character design and development is out of this world for a movie. It's usually harder to develop as good of a character with that much less time, but this movie pulled it off well. The main characters were 100% likable and they fit perfectly.
Enjoyment: -
I can't say I enjoyed or disliked it. It's not even to the point of where it's in-between making it a 5, it's just unrankable in my opinion.
Overall: - (i was forced to choose the overall in MAL, though pretend I had left it blank)
I don't regret watching this, although I highly doubt I'd rewatch. I'll get into more detail in the 2nd half, although I can say for now is that I cannot rate this anime properly. It'll sit unranked forever in my list. Do I recommend it? Yes and no. No matter your taste in anime, this movie will grab your attention. I say watch it if you want, although just watch with caution.

2ND HALF BELOW!
CONTAINS SPOILERS!
PROCEED AT YOUR OWN CAUTION!
========================
Now this is the part of the review where I rant and ramble on about how the eNDING was the most unsatisfying thing I've ever seen. It's like a large buildup, but nothing to proceed the buildup. I know the 2 met at the end, however that still isn't near enough! That leaves so many things hanging! Half of the movie I wasn't even sure what was real and what was a dream, heck, even now I don't! Did the world where she died even happen? Her name was in that book of deaths when he looked in it, yet his world and memory of that seems to be untouched. Was just that part a dream? Is the ending a dream and she really died? I don't f***ing know. I'm not sure if this is actually explained clearly and I'm just an idiot, or if it's supposed to end without the viewer knowing!! I went into this thing like ""Heck yeah this seems pretty cool"" 1/2th of the way in ""Wowzers this is pretty heccin coolio!"" and left with ""What the heck was that"". 
I really like this story! As much as it seems that I don't, I do! There's just so much unexplained it leaves it not fun and unsatisfying. I was really excited about rewatching this again after the crispy 1080p version was released, however that will not be happening.

                How is this the best-rated feature-length anime on here? Honestly, I can't figure this out. I kind of feel cheated by this near-unanimous praise, as I personally couldn't enjoy or relate to this story nearly as much as everyone else did, apparently.
[NO OBVIOUS SPOILERS BELOW, JUST A RATHER VAGUELY-WORDED PERSONAL OPINION. GOING TO KEEP IT SHORT, ANYWAY]
The plot is predictable almost every step of the way, a weak and quite transparent attempt to ""pull at your heartstrings"". The best word to describe the characters is... bland. Virtually nothing in the story makes the viewer actually care about them on any deeper level beyond the very
                  surface. Basically an ""okay, might as well see this thing through to the end"" type of situation. No real investment, no real emotional impact. 
I have no serious qualms about the animation itself; on the visual side, this was okay. I guess. Nothing spectacular about it though. From the get-go, this wasn't the type of anime to aspire to create a particularly creative visual style, however, so that's fair. Sound-wise, it's also nothing mindblowing... rather boring, actually.
To fans of this anime (and we know there's fans galore), it might seem like I'm reaching to just find stuff to criticize, but I seriously, honestly did not enjoy this much at all. I'm baffled at how well-loved this is, and I'm... sorry? I really was prepared to like this -- I didn't.",3,ecassan

My last reason is that there is such a sense of wonder it makes your eyes glued to the screen. One thing that kinda bothered me is that they don't show what happens after they meet each

Ahh, yes... the best anime movie. Is it? Not trying to spoil or anything, but it actually is. Let's get right into the review:
Story: 10/10
It is actually hard to find an anime as polished as Kimi no Na Wa, and it's story is just a masterpiece. You can tell that Makoto Shinkai mastered the art of storytelling, as this masterpiece keeps you engaged into the story during the whole hour and a half. It is also stunnning how this man can express such gorgeous feelings within just an hour and a half of watch-time, making the audience really blend into the plot. 
Art: 10/10
It's
                  a fucking CoMix Waves film, of course it's going to be beautiful. You can take a screenshot at any time of the film and set is as a wallpaper and it would still look gorgeous. There you go! You have watched one of the most precious films in history.
Sound: ∞/10
Radwimps. 
Character: 9/10
Personalization and characterization are one of the most important features of a movie, and Kimi no Na Wa performs an almost perfect job at making their characters loveable. Why ""almost""? Mainly because there are some characters that can be a little cliche sometimes. Despise this little feature, I think the world will remember Taki and Mitsuha for the rest of eternity.
Enjoyment: 9/10
Maybe the only thing that's preventing me from saying it's a 10 is the ""confusing"" time travel feature. There are some people who find time travel a little hard to understand, and there's nothing wrong with that. The solution? Watching this film a couple of times. Just let me tell you that watching Kimi no Na Wa more than once is one of the best ways someone can spend their time on.
Overall: 10/10
We can briefly conclude by saying that Kimi no Na Wa has clearly turned into a part of anime history, and will be remembered as one of the (or the) best movies ever made. Go watch it. You're missing out on something huge here.",10,Zonyboi

                To begin with, I really enjoyed this movie, it gave me chills and the sound and art were incredible.
But I did not quite like the story It was a bit too sloppy for my tastes and at times I cringed because it was kind of chliche. The characters were fine, not pretty relatable or interesting, if you asked me. I do not say that it was a bad story or that the characters were not good. They were ok overall, but they were not so great for my tastes,
But I really liked the art of this anime, it was outstanding and I even paused the
                  movie several times to enjoy it because damn, it is so beautiful. I really, really love the sound and art, which, in my opinion, saved this movie.
Overall, it was pretty enjoyable, yet I still believe that this movie is pretty overrated",8,_demonpox
32281,"
                The animation is thrilling, with the almost photo-realist views of Taki’s urban Tokyo life contrasting with the verdant hues of Mitsuha’s lakeside home.
Scenes of astral magic and natural disaster (an understandable preoccupation of Japanese cinema) lend a degree of spectacle that would put many live-action blockbusters to shame, while a hallucinogenic diversion into chalk pastel wonderment will transport even the most sceptical viewer to another realm.
Throughout, Shinkai juxtaposes male and female, town and country, science and superstition, past and present. But it’s in the twilight twinkling of kataware doki, when night and day meet and worlds old and new collide, that the real heart of
                  this story lies. Your Name spirals elegantly towards a point where beginnings and ends become indistinguishable, but does so more in the manner of a melancholy coming-of-age comedy than an abstract arthouse experiment.
For all its thematic complexities, there is plenty to laugh about too, from a recurrent gag about Taki being caught fondling “his” breasts while in the throes of a body swap, to the gentle teasings of Taki’s co-worker Ms Okudera, who seems more attracted to the transposed Mitsuha than to any awkward boy. Teen audiences in search of a “relatable” love story will find this every bit as accessible as Romeo & Juliet, while older viewers will delight in the way that archaic arts have become an integral part of 21st-century cinema.
Like the stories they tell, these moving pictures are a fusion of the ancient and modern. “Treasure the experience,” Mitsuha’s grandmother tells her sagely. “Dreams fade away after you wake up.” Not so this splendid movie, which will leave audiences in a heady reverie long after its mysterious light has faded from the screen.

Directly from the movie. Oh gosh, what can I say about Kimi No Na Wa?? It's definitely the most stunning masterpiece ever created by Makoto Shinkai. I don't know why he's always saying: STOP WATCHING KIMI NO
                  NAWA, IT'S NOT A COMPLETED STORY"". Bruh, Your Name was definetely one of the most beautiful movies that I ever seen.
Story: 10/10
The story is about a journey. On the plot, it's not very hard to understand: it's about Mitsuha (a girl who lives in Itomori, a inland city of Japan, that has to dream to move to Tokyo), and Taki (a boy who lives in Tokyo, that has the dream to be an architect). And mysteriously, after Tiamat comet fall, they started to change bodies and sharing experiences. And after a long time, they finally noticed that, and they basically are doing everything to know: why is it going on? A lot of peole said that: the plot has a lot of holes. I mean: yeah, but not completely. Clearly, Your Name has a lot of mysteries, and a lot of moments, that people that were watching went be like: WTF is going on? Well, if you don't understood, I'll try to explain:
This is basically a movie timeline:
1st: The First Comet Strike; hundreds of years ago, a comet struck the Earth and created the lake that Itomori now rests upon.
2nd: Mitsuha's Mother Dies; After the passing of Mitsuha and Yotsuha's mother, their father became detached and engrossed with politics. Their grandma takes over parenting.

So, yeah. If you don’t understood the movie: then this timeline is basically “the whole entire movie”. It’s confusing, but if you research for an explanation on Google, I’m sure you’ll connect everything on Kimi No Na Wa, exactly like how I was.
Art: 10/10
Coming from Makoto Shinkai, we we’re already expecting something magnificent. The art of Your Name is truly marvelous and beautiful. All the scenarios are very realistic, and the character and objects’ movement are very very fluid. There’s nothing too much to talk about the art: it’s a perfection, exactly like all the Makoto Shinkai’s animes.
Sound: 10/10
Oh my goodness, if you want a movie with the most catchy songs ever, then Your Name is for you. Literally all the Kimi No Na Wa’s songs passes by my head in a lot of days. Especially the piano soundtracks, like: Katawaredoki and Mitsuha’s Theme. For me, these two are the saddest and the most beautiful soundtracks ever in Your Name. And the soundtrack element is not like the majority of the animes. In most of the animes, we’re seeing animes, when in the touching moments, there’s only piano soundtracks. But in Your Name, this is different. Even on touching moments, there are soundtracks with RADWIMPS singing at the background. And as you know, Makoto Shinkai is a lover of RADWIMPS group. So, the soundtrack is one of the most remarkable elements on Your Name. Some of them are excentric (like: Yumetourou, Zenzenzense and Sparkle), and another of them are very sad and touching (like: Katawaredoki, Nandemoiya and Mitsuha’s Theme).
Characters: 10/10
The characters were really well-developed. But, I feel like I miss some Taki’s personality traits. Ok, on the movie, it showed about him, but I felt empty about that specific point. Both of them (Mitsuha and Taki) were really well-worked, but I really wanted to see more about: Mitsuha and Taki’s friends, for example (especially about: Sayaka, Teshi and Okudera). These characters didn’t have their past showed on the movie. But, even though, the characters personality were really well-developed. Again there’s nothing too much to talk about it: watching Your Name, you’ll probably find yourself on some moments. That’s what I’m talking about.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Overall: 10/10
Literally on that movie, everything is 10/10, and it’s ALMOST the perfection I mean. But, if you saw Your Name and didn’t understood for the first time, just go to Google and try to search all the explanations about the movie, ok??? That’s what I tried to write on the top of my review, but yeah. When you finally search about the movie meanings, and get to connect everything, you’ll ended up crying like a child. For me, this movie definitely hitted my feelings so hard, and I ended up crying and feel empty for a month. But, I’m sure that: after 1 month of emptiness and sadness, you’ll learn a very different (but very deep) lesson: “good relationships make the people healthier and happier. Just find the person that will make you happy, and dry your tears all the time”. And if you want to watch more Makoto Shinkai’s animations, I recommend you to take a look on: Kotonoha no Niwa, Tenki No Ko, and 5 centimeters per second. Those are also very sad (especially Kotonoha and 5 centimeters). That’s what, basically, Makoto Shinkai talks about on all your animations: the hard distance between the people. Anyway, I strongly reccommend you to watch Your Name. Just one advice: prepare, at least, two boxes of tissues, when you think to watch it.",10,tomioka_hashira

                Kimi no Na wa, otherwise known as Your Name, is a film that released last year in 2016. Your Name, written and directed by Makoto Shinkai, is one of the most astounding works of art in its age. Your Name is about two adolescents swapping bodies. With the troubles that come with living someones else's life, the teenage girl Mitsuha and guy Taki, are constantly swapping bodies when they fall asleep. Together they learn to cope with the swapping and decide to make a rule that they would live through the memo of each others lives. Without spoiling too much about this astonishing film, the
                  two manage to eventually meet each other through unusual circumstances. I would definitely recommend give this film an opportunity. The art done by three very impressive animators Akiko Majima, Takumi Tanji, Tasuku Watanabe, made it one of the most beautiful and captivating films to ever be made. Music by the Radwimps was beautiful as well, the music really captured the feeling of pain when there was a sad scene and a sense of warmth and happiness during a good scene. Overall character development was okay, we got to see Mitsuhas religious heritage and traditions an the every day life routines of both characters. although side character development lacked you can't expect a two hour film to detail every aspect of all the characters in the film. But, for what its worth I have rewatched this many times due to its characteristic to leave the viewer wanting more. I honestly don't think I could recommend a better body swapping, drama, mystery, and romantic comedy better than this one.",10,LegendReviews

                Plot: A+ *I went into this blind and you should too. But I'll give a brief synopsis. A boy and a girl of the same age from different parts of Japan feel as if a piece of themselves has been removed and because of it they are searching for someone. The girl longs for a life outside of her small town and wishes to move to Tokyo: where the boy lives. It's a coming-of-age story told in a unique and exciting way.
Visuals: A+ *Some of the most stunning visuals I've seen from any anime. Beautiful colors. Gorgeous landscapes. Creative low-fantasy elements. And adorable character designs.
                  Honestly, this might be my favorite anime film that I've seen from a purely visual perspective. I visited Akihabara and got to see some artwork from this anime and it continues to dazzle me. I also found a figurine of Taki and Mitsuha together reaching for each other and it looked so cute!
Voice Acting: *I'll get back on this one when I watch the dub. Outside of characters screaming when they have no business screaming, I had few issues with the voice acting of the sub. But I will say that the subtitles had some comical errors which I found off putting during scenes that should have been more emotional.
Second viewing this time with the English dub: A *Sorry guys I can never get aboard the sub over dub train. It just won't happen. I will always prefer my native language if I can help it. Even if I learn how to speak Japanese some day. But anyway, this dub is done really well with the only issue being the voice actress for Mitsuha occasionally sounding a bit goofy in the monologues and most funnily, the way that she as a high schooler, refers to her breasts as ""boobies"" lol!
Film Score/Soundtrack: B- *For the most part, the score does it a good job of helping you to stay connected with the characters adding to each scene. However, outside of Radwimps' super catchy songs, their score is pretty forgettable as a stand alone listen.
***My favorite track: Hard choice between Sparkle and Nandemonaiya but the latter gets the edge because of the feelz from the impact it has at the end of the film. The only other movie that comes to mind that literally had me on the edge of my seat and holding my breath waiting in suspense to find out if the two characters would get to connect was The Shop Around the Corner. So call me a bit biased when I say I prefer ""Nandemonaiya"" because of how it set the mood during those impactful moments. But with that being said, Sparkle has a super catchy piano melody and buildup and also plays during a heartfelt sequence.
Characters: B *When a film has you hoping that you get a happy ending at the end, you know that the writer's did a good job in fleshing out its protagonist. However, I will say that some of the side characters could have probably had more input provided such as Mitsuhara's little sister Yotsuha and her father especially who was very cold to her and if we had his backstory filled in more, or had the reveal about Mitsuhara's grandmother be a bit less subtle, that could have made his interaction with her towards the end of the film more meaningful. Regardless, the film did a really good job of making us care about Taki and Mitsuhara and I liked really liked Taki's friend/love interest Okudera and pal Fuji and Mitsuhara's friends Natori and Tessie.
Cringeworthy Anime Moments: I'm not going to lie, I was a little worried when the film started with a girl touching herself and moaning without much of an explanation. But as the story goes along and the plot is revealed to us, the more I fell in love with the film's humor and felt like the world was adorable. However, I will say that Tessie seemed a bit too eager with the idea of breaking into a construction site and to try and set off a bomb. I think the Japanese equivalent of the FBI might want to look into him lol!
Opening Titles: A+: Everything you want in an intro. Beautiful visuals. A catchy song. Some foreshadowing. And lyrics that pertain to the show.
Final Verdict: 9/10 *What I loved more than the originality and the idea of the film was the presentation of it. My friend walked in and asked me what the movie was about like 10 minutes in and I honestly wasn't able to tell him... until just a minute before the film spells it out. I love it when film's respect their audience and give them the chance to be patient with it. And I almost wish that the writer's didn't literally explain what was happening (in anime style of course with two characters saying the same thing at the same time). Regardless, having the realization on what the film was about gave me an ""Oooooh"" moment and it got me even more excited to continue with the film than I already was. The artwork in this is fantastic and the character designs are so cute that it makes you fall in love with them very early. This was a treat to watch and despite some flaws which will always happen when you make a movie that involves time travel and body switching, I think this is a genuine modern-day classic and will be regarded as such for years to come.",9,Lab_Mem_Num001

                I was so entranced by the story that I didn't get to focus on the music nor the art! However, I did replay the soundtrack from Spotify after the movie for a couple weeks and still go back to it at times. 
Gigguk's review just doubles my desire to see it again, but I was blessed enough to see it in theaters after my brother told me about it. Although at first weirded out at some parts,  I think overall such a great movie! Love Gigguk's analysis that the movie was really about those inexplicably affable connections with people who at face value seem
                  like strangers. (That the director really focuses his films on exploring some feelings that just can't be described in one word.)",9,kiDChen

Like something inside you says to keep looking, even if you don't know exactly what or who? As if something is missing in your life? Good, let me explain that feeling, and show how lucky you are to feel it...
First of all, let's present the film in question. Kimi no Na wa, or Your Name, is a film produced in 2016 by CoMix Wave
                  Films studios, Makoto Shinkai's original work, and it presents us with very interesting lessons and messages, especially when we analyze its story closely
It all starts in Itomori, a typical countryside city in Japan, where trains run every two hours, stores close at 9 pm, and the only place to have a coffee is at a Vending Machine in the city center. One of the most traditional spots in the city is the Miyamizu Shrine, a shrine run by the Miyamizu family itself, which is cared for by the youngest daughter Yotsuha, grandmother Hitoha and the eldest daughter, and one of the protagonists in the story, Mitsuha
Mitsuha is a kind, organized, supportive and adventurous girl who lives her teens in a relatively normal way, going to school, living with her friends and always helping her family to maintain the Shrine 's traditions, but that doesn't mean she is happy or even satisfied with this situation, be tired of the peaceful life of the countryside, the complicated relationship with her father or how her classmates comment on her work at the shrine, Mitsuha hates the city and her reality, even going so far as to wish to be a beautiful boy from Tokyo in her next life
After exposing her great desire to the universe, she goes through a situation, at least, unusual, because the very next day, she ends up having a very real dream, waking up in a completely new room, in a new city and, most strange, in a new body. After absorbing all these news, she learns that this body belongs to Taki Tachibana, a boy of her age who lives in Tokyo and has a busy routine in the big city
Confused by that and excited to finally be in Tokyo, Mitsuha takes this opportunity to “use” this dream and explore the big city and everything it has to offer. Be it walking in the busy downtown streets, going to school, eating wonderful sweets in a real cafe and even working as a waiter in an Italian restaurant. Despite this ""dream"" being longer than usual, Mitsuha took advantage of every second of it, since, for a brief moment, it was the fulfillment of her great desire
But, as the days go by, she discovers that this “dream” is more real than she imagined, since this is not happening only with Mitsuha, but with Taki himself. Whatever the reason, they end up switching bodies on random days over the weeks, and every time she stays in his body and lives his life, Taki also stays in her body and lives her life. And the plot of the story basically goes like this, with Taki learning to behave and live with Mitsuha's body, and Mitsuha learning to behave and live with Taki's body, ensuring that they don't cause any major problems in their lives and for the people around, which is obviously not an easy task
The interesting thing about Kimi no Na wa is exactly how it explores this theme, and presents us with another very interesting point of view on the subject, especially with this idea of exchanging bodies between Taki and Mitsuha, since yes, we can grow and evolve by ourselves, and the ideal is to continue doing that for the rest of our lives, but due to our nature, and because we are human, if we continue this journey completely alone, eventually we will find a barrier in our lives, because, alone, we can only grow to a certain port, up to a certain half, since the other half that will be empty cannot be filled by ourselves
Kimi no Na Wa is full of incredible messages and lessons, and the main one is to show that yes, we can grow and live alone, but when we're with the right person, the person that fate has already chosen for us and who connected us through the Red Thread of Fate, finally we can see how wonderful life can be

                Note: I will be spoiling the contents of this movie because I don't feel like I can write an adequate review without it. Please do not read this review until you have watched it.
I really wanted to think this movie was a masterpiece. I really did.
Maybe it's because I can never understand Makoto Shinkai's feelings or imaginations when it comes to writing romantic dramas. One thing I need to note is that I did not like Shinkai's previous work - 5 centimeters per second, at all. I feel like Your Name was a big improvement over 5 cm/s for the most part, but still feels
                  lacking compared to works directed by Mamoru Hosoda (Wolf Children, The Girl that Leapt Through Time) or the commonly compared A Silent Voice by Kyoto Animation.
Well then, let's get into the details, shall we?
The first half was beautiful. Just from the backgrounds, visuals, and sound direction, I can tell this was from the same people that created 5 cm/s. But unlike 5 cm/s, I was actually engaged with the story and connected with the main characters quite a bit. Showcasing the day-to-day lives of Taki and Mitsuha body switching was a pleasure to watch. Something that I would normally expect from a fanservicey-esque plot was naturally rendered into fun and endearing humor. I feel like Shinkai's greatest strength is creating gorgeous settings which let you immerse your imagination into the story and pique your curiosity of its direction.
I don't need to mention that the animation and especially the music was nothing short of a masterpiece. Shinkai's animation direction is unique in its own way. You can't really find anybody else who comes close to his style. Along with animation and cinematography came the beautiful soundtrack. Every piece of background music perfectly fit in with the mood of the scenes which made events feel much more powerful. The insert songs by RADWIMPS gave me goosebumps whenever they played.
The problem is the second half. When we find out that Mitsuha's town was destroyed by a comet three years ago, everything just falls apart. The reason why I am criticizing this has nothing to do with plot holes, if you were thinking about that. Most of the plot made sense and I'm really not one to be picky about anything contradicting each other as long as the feeling and message of the story goes through.
The problem is that Shinkai expects us to care so much about the characters an hour into the film that any kind of melodrama will work and affect us. The beginning was really cutesy and had the potential to set up a great relationship. It's not something that's been developed enough that you have two people confessing to each other that quickly. The first half never felt like it built up to the point where both Mitsuha and Taki were to confess to each other. Nothing really had happened until the comet pretty much blew up in our face.
The transition between the body exchange slice of life scenes and the time difference fiasco with Taki in Mitsuha's body trying to save the entire town was so sudden that you start to question what exactly is going on. It feels like someone just pulled you out of the ride and forced you to dive 90 degrees down to ground zero like they're assimilating you into a new religion. It's ridiculous how you can change the mood so suddenly and expect us to just go along with it like everything is natural. To clarify though, it's not the sudden comet event that was bad but the follow-up. You can write a good story with unexpected things happening but everything still needs to feel like it's flowing through so it doesn't break your connection with the characters you're relating to. I would go far as to say that this is one aspect that Your Name did worse than 5 cm/s as the latter at least never tried to force a relationship or melodramatic love.
What's worse is that after the sudden deus ex machina, I felt like I've lost all connections to the side characters, especially Okudera. It feels like everything that was built up was torn apart so that Shinkai can force a long lost time travel relationship back together. I honestly don't think I'm being too harsh either just because it only has two hours to express everything. Again, if I can come out satisfied watching a Mamoru Hosoda film or A Silent Voice, then I should be able to for something like Your Name which falls in the same genre.
All in all, it was still somewhat enjoyable. It was much better than 5 cm/s where instead of watching an empty container, this one at least feels like it started off with some substance. As much as this movie left a bad taste in my mouth, this and Shinkai's other works would still be one of the first movies I would show to describe good cinematography, art, and sound direction. I just can't say the same about the writing.",5,shootin

                Well, as most of Makoto Shinkai's works, this anime had such potential. But, things got way too cheesy in some parts, though that was a very small issue. The character developments were good enough. The animation was fantastic. The only thing that bothered me is, the story is incomplete. They never told us how they connected with each other in the dreams, weather it was some genetic thing or something else, they just never told us. Well, it was romance, but it was of new kind, something we never saw before. So, I appreciate that part. But, as I mentioned before, they just cant leave
                  the story incomplete. And people just ate it because it's ""romance"". Well, I get that. 
So, quite a good movie. If you love ""school romantic anime"", it will be a worthwhile to watch it. But don't get too analytical and enjoy what it has to deliver.
Once again, it would had been a great anime if only it was ""complete"".
I hope you get some idea about it. Thank you for reading. Keep watching animuuuuuuu!!!!! :)",6,sreen_animu

I am writing this review a year after the film's premiere but I wanted to wait till the hype stopped and I could come to a conclusion. I honestly feel that this was not only Makoto Shinkai's best work but the culmination of every element of his story and art and character was on display in this film.
I remember watching this all by myself, with my sister and then with my friends and each time I wasn't bored with the film maybe because by the second watch, I wanted to look at the details and mysteries of the film
                  and each time I watched I found new stuff from easter eggs from other films like Garden of Words to new revelations like the meaning of twilight to the film. 
Kimi no Na Wa explores the possibility of have you ever met a person who you had an air of familiarity or a memory that they were once a part of your life being a friend, a family member or a lover. It also takes a look at that longing feeling like someone or something is ever so close but it's just out of reach. Kimi no Na Wa is able to delve into romantic thinkings of finding the perfect someone and explaining why such stories may happen in the world but happen rarely.
The difference of this film unlike the other Shinkai films as this is a thrill ride that never stops as most of his films are really really slow at the beginning, the opening just blasts you with Yume Tarou and hints at what the movie will end like. This film is an amalgamation of genres with comedy, romance, drama, slice of life, time travel, mystery with a disaster movie thrown in it that raises the stakes. I believe Kimi no Na Wa is not a romance film even though the romance is a key element, it's more of an awakening for you to realize whether or not you have experienced what Taki and Mitsuha feel and that is the longing for someone to help and understand them.  
A criticism that I hear is about the characters particularly Taki on his absence of character growth but I feel that the characters were made to be simple so as the story felt like you were experiencing it. Taki is a dude who is mostly normal as he is a student who works part time and his only concern is to have a good relationship with his crush. These characters with Mitsuha included didn't need to have the angst with the character as Shinkai purposefully made these things in order to make people feel like this may have happened in their life.
Another criticism is the revelation of the time and space hole which I would admit was not so fond of when I first watched this film but when I started re watching it, it made sense due to the context of twilight which is a symbol of reality and fantasy emerging and sometimes miracles happen that screw the natural laws. A western perspective of this is magical realism but for the people of Japan, it is more marvelous as you can say and Ethnic Realism.
Now let's go to the pros of the film, where the art and sound is the foundation and heart of the film. Shinkai really should just animate real life as this shows how beautiful the locations and settings are with Radwimps music that makes the film feel ethereal then you got yourself an amazing music video. 
The best scenes in my opinion is the last three minutes of the film and where Taki and Mitsuha meet on top of the mountain as twilight happens. The reason for that is I believe this is where Shinkai started to go away from his usual elements and try to add something new with it while at the same time assuring the viewer that we are going to get hit with the same feels as all of his other previous works. Let me first talk about the twilight scene, Jesus I cried so much especially when the writing of I love you and forgot to place the name and then Taki wondering why he was there while Mitsuha was wondering who wrote the note on her hand while at the same time trying to save the town. This scene hits you with a range of emotions of sadness, anger, hopefulness, suspense and happiness. The next scene of the last three minutes is the culmination of everything the viewer has experienced and when they see each other again, you are hit with the hope that they remember and are running towards each other despite the far places they went because its love god damn it! Then when they meet and you see that they are unsure of what to do and that they are strangers, kills your heart man and when they walk away from each other in the steps legitimately made me and my friends toss the table because they didn't watch it. But when they turn towards each other for possibly the last time and see tears on both of their eyes and they ask if what they are feeling is the same on did they possibly know the other and ask for the name. I thought I couldn't shout 'Yes' any louder, the ending is an open ended as the viewer will now think on what happens in the next part of their story. I for one wished to see them hug or kiss and this film would have been the most perfect anime film for me.
Whether or not this is the perfect anime is up to debate but it is sure a masterpiece for giving people such as myself personal experiences that could not be explained with words alone and shown in this film. For that I thank Makoto Shinkai, I hope his next film will also be good and that this film should have at least been nominated for the Oscars instead of Red Turtle which only got there for being a Ghibli film and Kubo for being a western version of a boring tale. It actually should have won, that is all thank you and I hope you enjoyed this review.",10,NigmaShady

                I will probably be revealing some things about the film throughout my explanations so if SPOILERS annoy you, don't proceed.
I would like to start saying that I don't usually re-watch any kind of films that I already saw, only a handful have had the ""honour"" to be re-watched by me, the reason for this change of heart for ""Kimi no Na wa."" is related to a Tokyosaurus video which was talking about a theory that concerns about the ending of the film (I'm serious about spoilers, if you don't really care suit yourself) where Taki wrote ""すきだ"" instead of his name, in this theory it
                  was stated that by how Mitsuha started writing her name on his hand, it was clear that she had the intention of writing the same thing as he did.
So I had to watch the film again and confirm some things that are always better understood on the second view, for instance: whenever Taki has control over his own body, he will always remember to wear their red string of faith, but when Mitsuha takes control of his body, she doesn't wear it; another thing that I noticed is that when the grandma is talking to Yotsuha and Mitsuha about Musubi, the god and the underworld she states: ""the only way to comeback to your world is to left something that is precious to you for the god"" when Taki is back to Mitsuha's body after drinking the sake and they find each other, he leaves his feelings for her there that's why he was also able to comeback to his world and his body; still talking about the kataware-doki, and the theory, if you are not certain that this theory is correct you can rewind the film and see for yourself, Mitsuha a bit before the 30-minutes mark writes her name in Taki's hand and we are able to say that comparing all the traces that form her name to the single trace she was able to write in Taki's hand, she didn't intend to write her name as well, but ""すきだ"" as well, and you don't even have to understand Japanese for that.
I am also in favour with other theories that say that Taki didn't write his name because he was sure a name wouldn't be enough since they eventually forget each others names, so he had to do something deeper with much more meaning so they would connect, even though they didn't ""know"" each other.
I must say that I'm not really partial about Shinkai's work, I find his art stupendous and his stories are great, but this anime definitely deserves the score it has",10,curvedtree

Story (8): Although this was a fun anime to watch there are several plot holes as well as it being two hours when it could've been shorted to an hour & 1/2 especially with some of it's unnecessary side plots such as Taki's co-worker date thing.
Art (9): The art was beautiful but I felt it was kind of weird to include random CG, either go full cell-shade or full CG
Sound (7): I gave this a seven because although the instrumental music is fabulous I'm not really a fan of the songs w/ the singer's voice
Character (6): I didn't really feel a connection between
                  the two main characters,  like I was very relieved that they found each other again eventually but it just seemed underwhelming. I was more excited when Mitsuha's friends got together. 
Enjoyment (9): I smiled and cried so I had a good time
Overall (7.8): While it was 2 hours long some parts did feel very rushed. I felt there could be more exploration with the two character's relationship and how they feel for each other instead of through a montage. Parts of this movie also felt very ""tv"" like and if it was a TV show I think it would be a lot better that way everything gets explored. 
Is this movie a masterpiece? No
Is it good and worth a watch? Yes",8,Kimmipanda

                Warning possible Spoilers
When I heard this Movie/Film was getting high praise I had to see it and for the first 15 minutes I was unsure about the hype people were saying about, then suddenly everything just got better.
The story concentrates on Mitsuha and Taki who for some reason swap bodies from time to time and when they start getting used to this a sudden Natural Catastrophe turns everything upside down.
I have to admit the story felt different and fresh compared other Romances I've seem because it isn't often I see the swap bodies plot and having it used in a Romance so it was a
                  big surprise to see (Plus I didn't read the description which is probably why I'm surprised by it), but what also caught me off guard because I thought this would go in  different direction is that a Comet strikes Mitsuha's hometown and kills her which stopped the connection and I was again surprised to see the story go this way, it was very unpredictable was Your Name I couldn't at any point predict what was going to happen next so it shows that this was a very different story than from what I've seen in the past. There was a lot of interesting parts like seeing what Mitsuha and Taki were doing in each other's bodies and it was funny for the most part because they didn't know how that person lived so it was fun seeing their antics either improve or worsen their lives, It was interesting seeing time travel elements because it wasn't full on time travel, but a different variation and it was pretty cool seeing them use this to change the outcome of Mitsuha and her hometowns fate.
I enjoyed the characters and they were both different, but the same as well it shows that both Mitsuha and Taki weren't really happy with their lives so by some random event they end up swapping bodies from time to time and it was funny seeing the outcome of these antics since they don't act like themselves when this happens because Mitsuha is a sweet and adventurous person hence why she wanted to be a young city boy in her next and Taki was a quick-tempered person so it was interesting how their personalities changed their lives when interacting with other people around them or certain things that they did and when the Comet incident happens you can see the change in the characters especially Taki who becomes a more nicer and open person which shows how much one change can do and because of this change it drives him and Mitsuha too to change the outcome of their lives, overtime throughout the show you do see the connection between them grow too as from the start they bicker over texts and messages about what to do and not do with their bodies, but because of their long time apart from the Comet incident it shows they need each other and that was pretty much the bigger picture of the show.
The artstyle was amazing at times it could be colourful and other times it could be gloomy and it always set the scene in the right mood just looking at different areas of Itomori was a glorious site to see and even the comet was beautiful to look at despite how deadly it was, the soundtrack has to be applauded too because I really enjoyed it and it's not something I point out a lot, but whenever one of the soundtracks started it just instantly fitted the scene.
Despite this being a Romance Movie/Film it didn't really strike me as one until about more than half way through because of the first half concentrating on the swapping bodies and comet incident which obviously fitted with the supernatural part, but none the less it didn't really impact the Movie/Film in any way it just surprised me that the Romance didn't feel very dominant until pretty much the second half because usually I can feel the Romance element straight away if it's a concentration of the Movie/Film and not feeling it straight away did surprise me.
Overall I think this was definitely worth the praise it's been getting because for once it felt like a different and fresh approach to the Romance genre and this would definitely anyone who enjoys a good Romance.",10,Tyrannicswine117

                I originally posted this on Rotten Tomatoes, and I'm going to repost the same review here in case anyone has read it before minus a few small changes. I will say if you are an anime fan, or fascinated with Japanese culture, then you will love it for those premises alone. That said, just about anyone can enjoy this film including your non-anime friends. To start off the animation is some of the best I've seen, and I've seen a lot of animated shows and films. Furthermore, it's a breath of fresh air to see many people appreciate hand-drawn 2D animation, or at least that
                  style over the West which is producing mostly 3D CGI plastic looking animation. Nothing wrong with the Pixar type animation, but the fact Dreamworks to Disney Animation is utilizing the same style doesn't give stand out anymore, and in fact feels bland. Meanwhile when you watch Your Name, and especially certain scenes from showcasing Tokyo to the countryside, then it's breathtaking. Especially with how the animation utilizes lightning which is very distinctive in certain scenes. 
Now I won't spoil the story, and I'll keep it simplified. The first half of the story is a boy and girl switches bodies every few days, and it's almost a light-heart slice of life story with good humor. That said, as they continue to switch, both end up helping each other when they are controlling the other's body. I won't go into details, but both help them get out of their comfort zones and not allow the worries of everyday life and others get the best of them. This is where I started to relate to the story, especially in regards to developing themes of allowing everyday life keep us down to wanting more out of life. I've been through similar issues in the mid, and now late 20s. Beyond this point of the story things continue to develop, and eventually shift into some serious tones. 
I won't say much about the serious tones, but when this major plot point occurs, then the story gets very emotional with major developments in the plot. For me this is where the film went from good, as in a solid enjoyable film, to in my view a masterpiece. Now I won't say it's the best of all time, and it's subjective. But for me, and my friends and others who saw it, agree how the 2nd and 3rd arcs of the film caught us by surprise, and it become an emotional ride. 
I won't say much more on the story, but the way the story progresses feels believable overall, and the character development is incredible.The transition from humor to something serious worked well, and it didn't feel out of place. Despite some supernatural aspects such as body switching, but the story and development felt believable. Finally the music and sound design is incredible as well, and the original Japanese voice acting is great. I haven't seen it dub, and I will probably see it dub on home-video, but I heard the dub is mostly good minus the way how a few lines were delivered from what I've heard. 
I recommend everyone check out this film, even if you aren't an anime film. From a serious film perspective it's incredible. The only caution I throw out there is this movie isn't for kids. It isn't because there is violence, or sex, or anything like that, but kids won't relate to many themes and issues which are presented in the movie. It's for people who are at least a teenager, or ideally older. In fact, the themes and issues presented will relate more to adults . An ongoing theme is ""looking for something,"" or someone in this case which easily relates to people who are well in their 20s or 30s, especially as a millennial myself. That said, you would do a disservice to not give this film a chance.",10,panderson1988

                So yeah finally got around to watching the critically acclaimed movie by Makoto Shinkai which was the highest grossing anime movie in Japan.
Well I've seen Makoto Shinkai movies before and coming from that I walked in knowing the sort of animation I was expecting. Yes,Makoto Shinkai really is a genius in rendering an almost true to life image of the world he portrays through his works. Whether it be Garden of Words or this movie, the art and animation involved in these movies were something that you wouldn't just stop expressing by only the word beautiful.
But it's not just the animation and art that makes
                  what the movie what it is. Though I might be a bit too late to express my opinion in the mass ocean of reviews given in regards to the movie,but there's one thing I can say. No matter the fact that it used tropes pretty well known in the industry to bring us this movie but that doesn't mean the idea itself wasn't shown to us in a way where we found it to be refreshing.
The story itself is a pretty fairy tale made possible by impossible miracles but does it really matter when you're watching the movie? Don't we watch these because we're always searching for that something special in our lives, that impossible miracle where we find something beautiful enough to dedicate our lives to? The story through it's characters showed us that even if your brain forgets what little details you had for that something precious,you heart will remember and that one day you'll find it once again.

The art of Kimi no Na wa is outstanding, with incredible detail given to every inch of the scene.
The use of sound was good, however I felt that it could have been utilized more to include more diegetic sounds - rather than relying upon the use of non-diegetic music to set the mood throughout scenes.
I found the characters to be very believable and relatable, however I was somewhat disappointed with the lack of character development - the characters were essentially the same people at the end.
The loss of memory of the main characters after their experiences made the story fall flat for

Then, 15 years later this masterpiece comes out. I'm not gonna lie, I actually cried while watching because of the music, the emotion, and the feels of switching bodies.

                I come from a viewpoint of a moderate level fan of anime. I especially made an account on this website, to write a review for this anime movie. This is the first anime movie I watched. What I loved most about this story was the romance of it. The transition it made from comedy to a dramatic one so subtly. The visual effects were just something out of this world. I love the soundtrack as well.
Why I love this anime :-
1. Romance. - There is not a particular point where it is directly shown they two have fallen for each other. The way its shown
                  that they both love each other is by their desire to reach to each other. Of course then later on, when he writes on her hand 'I love you'. It's totally evident. But OMG so beautiful.

Only after the movie had ended did i realize that it was not in fact perfect, but in the moment, it just felt right. In the end, I should rate this film lower to be totally objective but it

I watched your name to see what the hype of the #1 anime movie was that was selling like hot cakes. I'm happy it wasn't a disappointment. Sure it wasn't amazing but it was a pretty decent movie. The story was pretty good with the body swapping but it got weird trying t o see if the story was going any where with that at all. Where the story went was very interesting with a plot twist that gives a big shock leaving you gripping your seat wondering how it'll turn out.
                  Art wise CoMix Wave films studio lives up to their name of great background art and scenery not much to say. The soundtrack though i didn't pay too much attention too had moment when it hit you when it needed to at part that were growing in intensity or moments of surrealness. Though i wasn't a fan of the music video type moments that happen in CoMix Wave films studio where there is music playing and a bunch of scenery shots with no real purpose but passing the time. The characters were not all that special or interesting which made it obvious it was more of a story driven movie rather than character driven but seeing the difference between the characters when they swapped bodies was interesting none the less.  Overall the movie was a 7/10. Nothing special but a decent movie none the less. Not something I would recommend as a movie to watch to someone but if they asked me if it was worth the watch i would say "" It was alright.""",7,Dokia

                There is no other anime that moved me like Your Name does. The story, character development, art, and especially the music score is top notch. Rarely do you come across a work that does so well in all of the above mentioned departments. 
In terms of the graphics, you can literally hit pause and take a screen shot at any point in the movie and you end up with a pretty good wallpaper. The music is so good that I went to Itunes to buy the official release of the songs, something I never done before. In short, Your Name is truly a masterpiece.

                This is by no means an anime without fault, but this is definitely a movie well worth checking out. Mikoto Shinkai is one of the most famous anime movie directors of all time, and his newest hit, Kimi no Na wa, or Your Name, broke records, and it is no surprise at all why. The combination of the cinematography, art, story, and emotions all served to tell the story of two teenagers, Taki and Mitsuha, as they must prevent... well, that's a spoiler.
Story 10/10
Story is a bit hard to judge, you can judge it on concept, execution, or how well everything works together. This is
                  a case where all three of those are done perfectly. The concept is about two characters, Taki and Mitsuha, who find that they swap bodies a few times a week, and learn about each other through notes they leave each other, at least, for the first half. I can't go beyond that for spoiler purposes, but the story becomes more intense in the second half, the stakes become higher, and things have more significance. This concept isn't just good, but was executed brilliantly, along with Shinkai's fantastic direction for music and art, making it a perfect combination of everything needed for a good story
Art 9/10
Now, this is probably the more surprising one, as it is a beautiful anime, yet has a 9. The reason for this is because this anime really enjoys using CG, and not all of it is what you would call good (heck, I wouldn't call half of it good), but these are minor and temporary distractions compared to when the art really hits it's golden point. Several scenes in this movie don't just look good, but are truly beautiful in more ways than one. Scenes that occur not only look good, but show strengths that can only really be achieved through animation, and the best that anime has to offer can be found in Shinkai's beautiful art. Now, if only they got rid of the CG.
Sound 10/10
No doubt, the sound is one of the best things about the anime. On top of the Cameo from Radwimps, giving not 1, but 3 songs that get you pumped for what's going to happen next, or leaves you at the edge of your seat. Leaving Radwimps aside, the music is fantastic, giving the perfect level of atmosphere needed to match the art and create beautiful scenes that immerse you in modern day Japan.
Characters 8/10
Now, sadly, this is one of the movie's weak points. A movie can't be judged on the same level as a TV show, since you have much less time to develop the characters and story as a TV show, but it still is possible to pull of good characters. This doesn't do that greatly. The characters aren't the most interesting, and overall, there is still quite a bit about them we don't know, as well as the characters aren't the most interesting or dynamic. Not to say they're bad, they're just... not the best. Despite this though, the story still works really well with them, and makes us care for the characters and what they do through interactions. Many scenes with the characrters show us a lot about them, and while it isn't flawless, it's definitely not bad.
Enjoyment 10/10
There is nothing I can say that would do this movie justice. I heard all the hype for it, and it did live up to it. The movie was a rollercoaster and enjoyable in so many ways. Not only were there scenes that were downright hilarious and other scenes that are really fun, but the scenes are emotional, suspenseful, and heartpounding. Towards the second half, I was watching inches from my screen, and by the end, I was bouncing up and down in my seat waiting for the ending. Even after the movie ended, I was looking to see if there was more after the credits, and even after watching, the feeling of euphoria from watching it isn't fading. Scenes will immerse you in their beauty, grip your emotions, and keep you on the edge of your seat in tears and shaking yelling at a bunch of cartoon characters like this were a raid night. 
Overall 10/10
It's well worth watching. While it's not perfect in any way, the perfect blend of stories, emotion, and suspense makes this a fun, suspenseful, and emotional ride that everyone should experience. If you're afraid it won't live up to the hype, it might now, but give it a chance, you will almost definitely enjoy it.",10,RequiemOfNEETS

                Right, Kimi no Na Wa.
2019 Edit:
Now that this is the most popular animated movies of all time, I would like to take sometime and point out serious problems with this and why has this been so divisive.
First, a little word. When I was writing my original review, I was hoping the show would fall around 8 which to me is too high but understandable. However, its popularity has completely blown me away. I can't believe such a poorly thought out, poorly executed executed piece of work could fool enough people by tapping on people's emotional surface. Looking through the reviews, you can see the great
                  divide between those who love it and those who hate it. The score only range from 9 and 10 to 5 and 6. There are seemingly no middle ground. Here's my thought on why this was the case:
The theme of every single Shinkai work has been distance. He made his characters experienced longing, an obsession with another human being that you don't really have a close connection with, if you really think about it. What kind of obsession do you have with another human being that you travel very far away, alone, just to catch a glimpse of that other person whose sole connection to you is a message you exchange everyday. You have never talked to that person, have never meet each other face to face, have not experience a date. Both of them impose on each other a version of each other that they have on their head. It's similar to 500 days of Summer with the montage of summer in the head of the protagonist. This, to me, is the problem. If the audience agrees with Shinkai version of love. They are completely hooked on the journey. If they don't, it's an unremarkable mess.
Let's start with something positive. Let's imagine the universe where love really exists like this. That you can fall in love hopelessly without ever seeing how that person act, speak and interact with others. Imagine, you have a roommate whom you never met and interact through post it note left in the morning. If you start to have an image in your head of a cute relationship, you are Shinkai's type of person. He's quite a sadist in that he likes to turn the story into tragedy, not with a dose of reality but with convenience more than anything. My name is his first work where the romance didn't go wrong somehow. In Byoushoku 5 centimetres, he ended unceremoniously with ""the girl likes someone else"". Perhaps the clumsiest way to turn it into a tragedy. But, I won't deny it is very diabetic inducing. It's kind of like Romeo and Juliet but more exposition than plot. The romance, I will admit, it's pretty funny. I think the characters are written as bland and forgettable as possible to help the audience to impose themselves into the character's role as much as possible. It is quite nice to think about a situation where someone is longing my existence and vice versa, and the catharsis when you finally met. 
The problem with this, is if you don't buy into the Romeo and Juliet without any substance, it goes very very wrong. Let's dissect for the benefits of those who do not understand why this romance is seen as obsession by most realist. If you actually watch 500 days of Summer or Romeo and Juliet, you'll notice the aesop, or the moral of the story is this kind of love is destructive and delusional. Romeo and Juliet would risk their life for each other, rendering their existence meaningless without the other. It turns out that had Romeo not foolishly committed suicide the moment he saw Juliet death, they would have had a better ending. In 500 days of Summer, Tom's obsession with Summer led him down a path of confusion, hatred, anger but eventually he realised he was being foolish and snapped out of his obsession with the idea of being in love with a version of Summer in his head. Perhaps it is not a coincident that many people complete misinterpret the movie, leading to Joseph himself has to clarify the movie's message to its audience. This kind of romance don't grab the other half of the audience because perhaps they have been through this kind of phase in their life or they have figured it out through experience or was never in love with this idea in the first place. For those who are not enchanted by Shinkai's magical romance, they are in for a bad time. You can tell in the first place, outside of the romance, everything else is touch and go. I won't discuss what I have said before about the characters and certain plot lines but let me talk about the themes a little more. Firstly, Shinkai put in some nostalgic nature old timer stuffs by drawing a peaceful far away village with ancient tradition. The story is very shallow about what's the magic is about, what's the importance of tradition in the town. To draw a comparison, let's look at my neighbour Totoro. It's not exactly the same but the depiction of the Japanese countryside is beautiful and interesting. Hell, just exploring the house in that movie is interesting. Why is that? That's because the countryside is an integral part of the story, not a side activity plucked in to explain the body swap / time travel. The second thing is the disaster theme. Now, Shinkai had mentioned his idea about the movie came from the Fukushima incident. I understand his inspiration to draw up a scenario where the evacuation is smooth and everyone is saved. Alright, then why did he makes the incident so trivial? In the story, the meteor could have been replaced with her being stabbed or something and I do not think anything would have changed. He should not have focus on the romance if he wants to bring the eyes to the disasters. You know what would have put the disaster on the forefront? Destruction. One crater is not enough. Look at Godzilla. Hell, we don't need to go as far as Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, just other Ghibli movies like Mononoke's slime or Ponyo's storm. Behold the power of nature, knocking down men's arrogance with a wisp of a wave. What's not impressive is a flash of light. At least shows the destructive aftermath, make a long, impressive scene of the work setting up the festival, all the carpentry involved etc... then show them being burn into cinder during the flash of light. Instead, Shinkai chose to focus on the least interesting part of his setting, the romance.
I get why Shinkai has many fans. I know that if you like his version of romance then it's just one hell of a ride after another. Unfortunately, if you don't. It's a tasteless mess, deserving of the low scores it receives. 
Original:
To be fair to fans of Shinkai, I have never bought into his ""genre"". He likes to produce works of the same theme. Of course I am not complaining about the lack of creativity, although that would play a factor in my judgement. I am complaining about his failure to explore which in my opinion could be different from creativity and for me one of the greatest problem about this work.
But I digress, after all the only reason someone would read or watch a review is to see if your time is worth wasting on this product or to reaffirm your opinion about the product, hoping everyone would agree with you as if you need it to be affirmed by nameless individual on the internet. If you are the former, I have bad news for you.
Let's start with the story.
I have to be honest I am indifferent to his stories. The problem with Shinkai stories is that they are just different spins on his favourite exploit victim: distance.
Worse still, is it the same aspect of distance: love, or specifically romantic emotions: From separating due to moving family to mission in space to war to literally never met each other, to me it's all the same. I have no problem with his theme, distance is a simple, common and relate-able theme however I always have beef with Shinkai over how it is portrayed in his works, Kimi no Na wa is not exception.
I have 3 problems with his story in general which Kimi no Na Wa is no exception:
-Characters
I dislike the fact that to Shinkai characters the only thing that matters in their life is love, it actually distances myself from them ironically.
This time, using the amazing tool that is the mobile phone and some body swapping magic, the pair fall in love and close up their distance. 
I was disappointed when the cast around the main characters are much more interesting now compare to his previous works which were basically just the main characters and sometime a third wheel. I applaud him for that and right after that he let me down. The rest of the casts were push aside to emphasise the main character emotions and determinations instead of being actual people with actual motivation and emotions. I have to be honest I only like the first part of the movies story when their daily life are portrayed with energy and the supporting characters help drive the story and grow the characters. The second part focus on the main character instead and completely lost me right then and there, making me go: another Shinkai story.
-Love
 I don't hate Shinkai stories, I find them excruciatingly egoistic and lacking in humanity. It's too dream-like, a perfect boy-girl relationship and the barrier preventing them from being together. It feels like someone who live in a world where nothing in their life matters and the only thing they care about is romance. I complain about humanity in characters because his stories are very character driven and their emotions, thoughts matter to the message he's sending. If you want to evoke emotions through characters don't portray them as ridiculous boys and girls whose heads only possesses one shade of pink. 
It reminds me of Genji Monogatari of all things (the novel) where all the characters chief concerns were love and that's it. Comparing it to Genji Monogatari is unfortunate of course, one is a classic novel about life in the Heian Court, the other is about 2 teenagers swap bodies and fall in love. 
I am also critical of the way he portrays people falling in love. These 2 people have never met each other, have only exchange messages and have never speak to each other. 
I find them falling in love with each other and spend a huge amount of effort to find each other quite ridiculous, not to mention that magic moment is in a bloody fast forward. 
It's just a slideshow of the two of them getting on with each other life and then she gets jealous because he's going on a date with his co-worker.
-Humanity
I find Shinkai love unconvincing. I don't find the suddenness nor the gradual affection convincing in his works. If you go back to everyone of them you find him avoiding the ""falling in love part"" and instead only dwell around the separation part of the relationship. He has to establish that the two of them love each others very much by sending messages or letters to convince us of that. The problem with that is without knowing how strong is their bond or what they have been through together, we could only imagine or guess, I don't find that emotional or convincing in the slightest. He always makes the characters act very dramatically about their romance, we are supposed to look at these unrealistically in-love people without all the nitty-gritty of real-life romance. It's hard to buy it and I don't, at all. 
This is the first time he tries to portray love from the beginning.
I think he did an abysmal job at best and it is really embarrassing to watch how clumsy he gets especially when he decided to skip the love moment entirely and jump to the jealousy part. It's never ever done well with Shinkai. There could be several reasons for this: Shinkai just love the idea of separated love but is actually indifferent about love. He could be concerned with the art alone and not focusing on the story and characters, prefer to satisfy his desire to draw colourful skies instead of colourful characters. Another reason I could think of is he writes the story as a short story (which is true for Voice of a Distant Star alone if you ask me) but unfortunately was asked to deliver a whole package each time and every time he would shell out a short story, forgetting about the movie part. If I have to find competition to his works I would point to Jun Maeda who also like to exploit a theme to death but Maeda characters are always very close to your heart. They are believable and likeable. Each of them possesses their own struggle and personality. Shinkai characters are as cookie-cutter as it gets. Again and again he fails to deliver a good love story and to Kimi no Na wa is not an exception.
Shinkai art to me suffer from the same problem I have for all of his previous works: Pretty for the sake of being pretty. His connection from scenery to the theme of separation could be sum up in one sentence: even though we are under the same sky, our distance doesn't shrink. Yes that includes train, sky, slope hills etc..etc.... It might sounds deep the first time but it is not because that's all there is to his works. He has more budget this time so instead of drawing many useless objects he draws a fuck tons of useless meaningless object that fails to create a scenery connecting to his theme. As much as I love beautiful scenery porn, a scenery porn that does not set up for the story or its theme is just a useless beautifully design website for a mail box. It's great but I don't think the effort was made at the right opportune. Frankly, it is a waste. If you are wondering is there any example of scenery porn helping with the theme I would point to Aria the Animation. They butchered Amano amazing scenery because of budget and because of that despite the wonderful relaxing soundtrack the show feels lacking compare to the master piece that is the comic. The comic with its theme of enjoying the mundane beauty is lost when the mundane in that show looks the same everywhere and the scenery has no character at all. Kimi no Na wa scenery has character but that character doesn't add anything to the theme, merely distraction to the overall story. Honestly the reason why all of them have character is because they are based on real life location which I consider cheating. Just look at Miyazaki to see original yet full of character scenery that somehow so animated and add into the theme of his story. Speaking of animation, Shinkai animation is mundane and lack of life again. I have to be honest making good animation is extremely difficult and very seldom could I find a movie with good animation but that's the least I expect from big budget animated movies. At this point as Shinkai have been using the same objects in focus so much (train, sky, slope, hill) I think he just enjoys drawing up instead of actually thinking about making them a part of his story.
When it comes to sound I seldom complain about the Japanese. It's amazing how good soundtrack elevate an average movie into an emotional train. I thoroughly enjoy the music from start to finish. I find it more and more difficult dragging myself to the cinema, sitting next to some sleazy bag with his friends watching an ""anime movie"" when they completely lost the originality and depth and I have so completely engrossed with years ago. The music however left me with a good memory every single time. 
I can't find any depth worth mentioning and there's nothing new to explore in this work. Before you call me a heartless monster for nothing being touch by all the ""feels"" in Shinkai, Maeda works (yes not even After Story, and the ending makes me feel betrayed), I cry every time I watch Sophie left her home in Howl, when Ashitaka left his village behind in Mononoke, when the sisters lost each other in Totoro or even when Ryan was told he was a good man at the end of Saving Private Ryan. I know people are touched by different things but I don't find Kimi no Na wa tocuhing at all when I find Ookami Kodomo short romance at the beginning touching. I can't help finding Kimi no Na Wa enigmatically overrated. Even worse, after watching Koe no Katachi the movie I find this movie even more underwhelming and Koe no Katachi is in no way a fantastic adaption.
So who is this movie is for? I would dismiss Shinkai fans because they are fans and not ""ordinary people"". I honestly could only recommend couples to watch this in their sparest time. What kind of emotion would this leave them, I have no idea to be frank. The show confuses me rather than touching me. For me, only couples could somewhat understand the feeling of distance and the sense of longing that he tries desperately to convey. I truly have hoped that Shinkai finally makes me teary but as usual it is another let down.",7,duylinhsss

                Kimi no Na Wa/Your Name is a movie directed, written and created by the fabulous Makoto Shinkai. 
The review rundown:
Music and sound: The movie's music and sound is awesome where I watch it on my cellphone using my headphones with the Bluetooth feature. It gives me the feeling of amazement and music to my ears while watching every scene of the movie. The voice actors (regardless of the language) are great because they suited to their appearances and emotions.
Story: At first, I've wondered why they're changing bodies in the first few minutes of the film and it becomes understandable in the later scenes. Its story
                  is very simple but as the movie progresses it becomes deeper. 
Character: All of the characters have simple personalities and they even blended it with emotions during each scenes of the movie despite of having deeper personalities for the main characters.
Art and Animation: Some animation scenes have 3D CGI that makes it realistic and smooth. The beauty of Mitsuha's home town and some notable locations in Tokyo such as Suga-jinja in Shinjuku district is also shown in this movie which is very realistic.
Overall: The movie is totally a masterpiece and enjoyable which I've even thinking to watch it again this love month (February).",10,The_Anonymous28

                I will firstly say that slice of life/romance anime are not really my style. It's really difficult to keep my interest if you come here with an anime that goes ""Oh school life... teenage stuff and things... romance that never progresses WITHIN the anime"" I'd just up and out.
Kimi no Na wa has a bit of a slow start but the beautiful art and the affinity of the music/the sight/the voice actors all correlate as one like a symphonic piece. I've always thought their language was so poetic and even artistic both in dialect and literature. This film does a pretty good job at that
                  and even distinguishing Japanese culture.
The added sense of supernatural element to it does not ruin the story by being too far out; in fact it's endearing. You can't wait for them to switch bodies because the interactions between the two is funny and heartwarming. Also the twist including some turns into the story was a nice bit; I was wondering when falling in love with it how it can ever go wrong because there HAS to be a climax and some kind of challenge to the protagonist to find happiness.
I came in here expecting to be cheesed out with some corny romantic goof flick but instead I was blown away and left stunned at how good it was. Though I didn't cry at all. Maybe I'm dead inside.",10,joh2141

                (Please forgive me if this doesn't make much sense, it's 3am, I'm emotional and I have never reviewed anything until now)
10/10 WATCH THIS WITH YOUR PARTNER and if you don't have one then please watch it with someone that means a lot to you, I think that this is something everyone should get to experience in their lifetime, especially with a loved one.
I watched this for the first time tonight with my boyfriend and it was one of the best experiences of my life, this is a night that I will remember forever. The emotions that I felt are some that are completely new to
                  me, and I'm so glad I got to experience them alongside this film and with the person I love the most.
The story, the art style, the music, everything about this movie just WORKS. And combined they just create something truly amazing. This really was wonderful, and if you're thinking about watching it then THIS IS YOUR SIGN!!!

                So when i started watching Your Name 20 minutes in i thought im gonna rate it 10/10 why? Because the characters are cool, the story was a bit confusing but was still really good and enjoyable. However the story changed in such a bad way. By bad way i mean the story turned way too confusing to understand, it started making less sense every minute. I know supernatural genre animes are typically confusing at some point but Your Name took that to a next level. The characters started acting rather weird too and after some time it became unenjoyable because it had so much potential
                  if the story just didn't change that way. The art was amazing, 10/10 animation for me and the sound fits well in every scene but actions taken by the characters became more and more confusing and i eventually didn't understand anything anymore because of how confusing it was, not just the characters behavior but the whole plot, story, etc. Itself.",4,xchikara

I'd like to see how the story would play out from the end but i feel like that'll spoil part of the mystery, maybe a short 30 min movie to say how is could continue whilst keeping it optional to not need to watch it.

                This movie was seriously spectacular! I will never forget it. The characters, music, plot and overall art is incredibly memorable. I was also extremely emotional the entire time, so there's that. 
I think this movie is a must-watch in anime. Regardless how you feel about romance, this is not the stereotypical romantic anime, and actually has mystery components to it. From the very beginning, you will be intrigued and curious about what's going on since the movie just starts off right into the action without immediate explanation. As a result, you'll be hooked! 
The art is really something else. It's stunning! The music was beautiful

                This anime was pretty confusing to me as i didn't quite understand the meaning and moral of the story, the animation and art though is pretty good and which is the main reason I initially watched the anime for the sole purpose of mezmerizing the artwork. The plot was ALL OVER THE PLACE and didn't quite stick to one clear path. But the sound was like earrape to me and they used unecesary sound design for the worst parts. The characters and their designs are the only bad thing about the art of this anime but it's anime so wahtever. The anime's attempt to be
                  emotional was quite the failure as it did not affect me whatso ever.

                MyAnimeList, and many people on here will review with a score followed by a short reason as to why they gave that score. 
Kimi No Na Wa (Your Name) by Makoto Shinkai, however, I believe shouldn't be reviewed on such a system. Kimi No Na Wa is a very particular kind of Anime. A beautifully written, gorgeously animated, heart-wrenching movie, and it will leave an impression on your mind and heart.
You may find yourself suddenly obsessed with a small town in the Japanese countryside. You may find that your heart aches when you see certain faces or hear their names. You might feel that at
                  the end of this adventure, you have a feeling of emptiness, and yet you are also hopeful. It's a strange sensation, and it's one that Shinkai has masterfully crafted and manipulated to make you feel. You feel what these characters could be going through, that feeling of hope, loss, confusion, joy, desperation, and relief. You don't just watch these characters go through this story, you almost become a part of it. This movie will become a film analysers dream. Packed full with masterful art, animation, writing, dialogue, and screenplay. Yet done so well that while watching you notice none of that, as you have become completely engulfed within these character's lives and the story they have to tell.
There is a reason why this movie has suddenly rocketed to #1 on this site.",10,Winnie_Blue
32281,"
                Creator Makoto Shinkai crafts an original, organic and beautiful mise en scene, that romanticizes the everyday struggles of Mitsuha and Taki. The visuals, particularly in Itomori, are stunning, and will invoke a potent desire among city-dwellers to rush off to the simple countryside. The background score perfectly complements everything you see on screen, and helps bring the story’s emotions to the fore.
Props are also due for Mitsuha’s adorable younger sister, Yotsuha, for serving as the film’s comic relief.
Your Name (Kimi no Na wa) has immense crossover appeal, not just in terms of geographies and cultures, but also across age groups. I therefore wholeheartedly recommend this
                  film to everyone, even people who haven’t seen any anime before.
Go in with realistic expectations though — this is a teenage romance film. Treating it as science-fiction is only going to ruin it for you.
In the quest to be taken seriously, too many films cheat the audience by introducing a sad/ironic twist at the end. Your Name works so well because it’s a rare film that shuns this temptation and dares to be a romantic.",10,Sujoy

                Story [9/10]:
I like how the story doesn't explicitly say a lot about it and allows the viewer to put pieces together like a puzzle to determine the plot. The story also seems to always be moving, as one problem is solved, another is introduced. This movie keeps you (at least it kept me) very engaged the whole time. I went into this movie with some knowledge of what it was gonna be and I thought that it would be a relaxing watch but I was on the edge of my seat waiting for whatever next was about to happen. The only reason I give this
                  a 9 instead of a 10 is simply because some things in the story aren't explained and they kind of leave minor plot holes, however these are extremely minor issues in the grand scheme of things and this truly is an amazing story.
Art [10/10]:
The art quality of this anime is honestly orgasmic. I understand obviously that as a movie the production quality is higher and always going to look better than any TV production but considering I personally do not watch a lot of anime movies, it was extremely refreshing and crisp to look at something so vibrant and crisp. Everything in this movie is absolutely gorgeous and is a true masterpiece in its artistic aspect.
Sound [10/10]:
An absolutely beautiful soundtrack set the tone and atmosphere constantly throughout this film. It enhances the artistic aspect beautifully and make the viewing experience feel surreal. This movie itself is an experience that is only supported by its beautiful art and beautiful choice of music. The character voices are also very matching for their appearance and exuberate emotion in every syllable spoken to create a story that feels real for the setting and the audience.
Character [9/10]:
Mitsuha and Taki are names you should never forget after this movie. They carry the whole story and are polar opposites but yet they go together so well. The only reason not to give this category of the film a perfect 10 is because sometimes our main characters do questionable things that in my opinion hinder the flow of the plot. The supporting characters also seem somewhat two-dimensional and I don't think they get enough screen time to be as flushed out as Taki and Mitsuha. However, I love how the story tells both of the story arcs in very specific ways and it is extremely easy and entertaining to determine who's perspective you are following in the story. 
Enjoyment [10/10]:
I loved watching this movie with my girlfriend and I thought that it was a perfect movie for us. We both were extremely engaged and I would recommend showing it to a friend. It actually took me 6 months to get around watching this movie with my girlfriend and it was definitely worth the wait. I would love to watch it again and pick up on any minor details I may have missed while focusing on the main plot being presented in front of me because I definitely feel that there is a lot of potential for foreshadow or simple background art that can go unnoticed upon the first viewing.",10,theballsiestcat

                **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**
The only reason I watched Kimi no Na wa. was because of all the hype I was hearing about the movie. I've never been interested in movies or shows that deal with time shifts or body switching, but this movie was better and worse than what I thought it was going to be.
Story (7/10):
The story was pretty clear from the start, but I started to not knowing what was going on half way through the movie. I was expecting an everyday movie about 2 kids who switched bodies. I did not expect a 3 year time line gap between the two protagonists,
                  and that is what started confusing me. I don't know how Taki traveled back in time to help Mitsuha at all, and the movie never tells you how the whole time shift even works. I feel like the ending made up for the confusion a bit because I'm glad they met up once again.
Art (10/10):
I like to draw as a hobby, so I often look at anime and people's art works in my spare time. The art in Kimi no Na Wa. was inspiring and beautiful. The animation was very fluid, and I never felt like the animation wasn't at it's full potential.
Sound (10/10):
I'm one of the watchers who never can tell a movie or show by it's sound track unless I'm an avid fan. I really liked the opening and ending theme, and the sound throughout the movie never made me think ""Why is this in the movie?""
Character (6/10):
The characters had no personality what so ever. The design was very bland. I probably couldn't remember their faces a few months from now. 10 minutes after the movie, and I couldn't remember the female protagonist's name. I had to look it up while writing this review. I believe the movie is supposed to be pretty realistic besides the fact that the main characters shift bodies and go back in time. Some of the background characters interested me more than the protagonists, such as Okudera.
Enjoyment (8/10):
There are definitely more shows out there that has made me cry or laugh more. I actually cried more than I laughed, and I only cried 2 or 3 times. It kept me interested through the whole movie because I wanted to know what happened next, so I believe that is enough enjoyment for me. I lose interest pretty quick in something if I don't think it is worth my time.
Overall (8/10):
The movie feels finished and nice overall. The way it is presented sure is a little eye catching. I'm not sure if I'd watch it again by myself, but I'll probably listen to a few songs from the movie a few times in the future. I think it is worth a watch at least once.",8,Meltskee

                Kimi no Na Wa is currently my favourite anime. I have seen A LOT of anime (Even though my profile may not show a lot on anime. Dont worry, Im slowy going through the lists) and I tend to be quite picky with them. If there are small things, I tend to take it out of proportion. Kimi no Na Wa tells a supernatural, romantic story about two high schoolers who meet through a very strange way. From here on, a beautiful and sad story is told.
Story:
The story itself is easily a 10/10. The way Matoko Shinkai progresses the story allows all the viewers to
                  understand it. There have been some movies that are pretty hard to understand; they confuse you but Kimi no Na Wa was clear, understandable and purely beautiful. Movies, well for the most part, contain cliffhangers that make the viewer imagine what happens to the characters once the credits roll, or perhaps even have endings that completely disppoint the viewers. I dont want to spoil anything but I will hoever say this. Kimi no Na Wa has one the best endings I have ever seen. I remember when I saw the numbers of the movie time reaching the end, I was panicking becuase at the point I was at, I thought ""I swear to God, if this movie ends just like 'that' Im going to absolutely lose it!"". Kimi no Na Wa did not end terribly rather, it was beautiful and I couldnt have asked Matoto Shinkai to end it any better than that.
Art:
Matoko Shinkai has been known for his work to has stunning art. Some of his works off the top of my head are 'A Garden of Words"" and '5 Centimeters Per Second'. These had amazing art and Kimi no Na Wa, I can tell you did not disppoint. The art was too good. I found myself having to rewatch scenes because I was too immersed in the art that I missed what the Characters were saying. The scenes were so smooth. This 'unreal' art is nothing like real life (Well obviously) but what I mean is that Matoko Shinkai took unreal to another level. The shadows and lighting was at a glance, unreal but it just did stick that it was unreal. This doesnt really make sense but it was so unreal that it was so real, if you get the gist of what I mean.
Sound:
The sound was great.In the opening of the movie, one of the main characters, Mitsuha was doing a bit of a voice-over. The sound of her voice was 'resonating' in my ears (Though this may just be the work of my godly headphones). Needless to say, there were no cracks or errors that ruined the experience of the anime. Now I  saved the best for last. The soundtrack. The soundtrack was produced by RADWIMPS, a Japanese rock band. The soundstrack was absolutely stunning. I really likeed how the main focus of the music was slow and (somewhat) sad music. One of my favourite songs, Katware Doki was just so good that the next day I went ahead and learnt it on the piano. Others like Yumetorou and Zen Zen Zense are more upbeat; rock. Audio queues that led the music into the movie were pretty amazing. Im not expert on rating music but this is truely what I think.
Character:
Character was the only section in which I didnt rate it a 10 (xD). This was because at some points I found myself disliking Taki. He was a pretty stubborn(ish) characters and I didnt mind that at all, just some points he got on my nerves. That was really the only thing that I found negative so it's all downhill from here. All the rest of the characters, and I mean all, were very well designed. I kinda felt that there wasnt much of a variation in the personalities because every one just seemed so nice. Mitsuha and her town, they were all bright characters. So why did they deserve what happened to them? Back to Taki. I loved the way that the progression of his character led. He cam from this somewhat stubborn character to this outgoing guy who changed his emotions towards one person to someone else. Character development is one of the, or if not the most important aspect of an anime and Kimi no Na Wa managed this with amazing ability.
Enjoyment:
I recall the first time viewing this movie. It was during one of the holidays of my college year, one of the holidays that I had to study for my mock exams. The night that I watched Kimi no Na Wa, i completely forgot about my upcoming (mock) exams and all the stress and anxiousness flowed out of me and I was immersed in this space where I had not worries. That was pretty cheesy but that is truely how I felt at the time. Kimi no Na Wa combines humor, the supernatural, romance and mystery in 1 hour and 50 minutes and was very well executed as well. I loved watching this movie and I cant tell how many more times I will re-watch it.
Overall:
Overall this movie deserves a 10/10. I can not stress how much this movie deserves even more praise (Even though its the #1 anime on AML at the moment). Every once and awhile an absolute gem comes out of Japan and the buzz around it is just amazing. I love to hear how this movie practically came out of nowhere and it just blew everyone away on how good it was. Im gonna be honest, the first time I watched this I was stunned. I thought that this would be another movie that wouldnt be EXTREMELY popular but the next month I had a look on MAL's ranking and what do you know. This masterpiece was the #1 highest ranked anime. Needless to say, if you havent watched Kimi no Na Wa yet, what are you still doing here?",10,Wunderworld

But randomly they wake up in the other gender body. That's where the fun starts... They have a lot of rules to be sure that they don't ruin their life. Many colorful personalities. 10/10
Enjoyment/Overall: Everyone's lives diverge in different ways, things happen in dreams and are forgotten the next day, things happen in reality and are forgotten over a lifetime. That's looks like crazy dreams,but it is like it's something different. 10/10 for Enjoyment and 9/10 for Overall.",9,Lyubomir

                Another extraordinary movie that Makoto Shinkai made.
Kimi no Na wa its possibly the best anime movie that ever created. This movie have almost all the genres in it. They have romance, comedy, slice of live, drama, even fantasy.
But now let's talk about comparing this to the old movie 5 cm/s. In 5 cm/s the protagonist have a deep relationship with the main heroine since childhood but when time goes on the 2 of them must separate from each other. But they both try to keep in contact to each other even the guy travel across the country just to meet her.
So in 5 cm/s movie
                  both people who care and love each other must face the fact that they can't be together. But you can feel the protagonist feeling when he keeps growing up even have his own career has experienced love with other women but he still can't forget his childhood friend who never contact each other again. And this is sad.... like really sad.
Let's go back to Kimi no Na wa, like 5 cm/s both man and women separated from each other. But in Kimi No Nawa not just the place that keeping them apart but also time, and this is very intersting because both of them are trying to see each other they write name to one another but they will forget about it. Just like a dream it will faded away eventually .
But the ending its different with 5 cm/s.
The art style wow..... really sutied best for this movie because is so beautiful and so calming and also realistic in every way you look.
The song really support the plot and confilt in this movie.
The characters is so simple but so good and so perfect with the story. I think they try to make the characters look more realistic but still have a touch of anime.
Both men and women in this movie have a different story to their own like the guy try to date his friend at job but he couldn't do it so the women did it for him. It just that every little touch of this movie is really breath taking.
The comedy however is so funny, like the timing for laugh is perfect and they kind of balance the comedy part with the drama part.
This is the perfect movie to tell how mysterious god works but at the end... it was for the best.
Stop reading, watch the movie. Please.....",10,_Kay

Story - 10
The story isn't extremely complex or extremely simple, it does well to intrigue and surprise without being annoyingly confusing. The plot may seem to take a while to kick in, having no real problem to solve until half way through the movie, but this time is spent setting up the characters and the feeling of the film. The surprises are not shocking if you were paying close attention to details while still being a nice way to ""shock"" those casually viewing. 
Characters - 9
Main characters Mitsuha and Taki are both emotionally developed throughout in a believable way, and their character design
                  and personality are attractive, emotive and able to connect to audience members. There are some decisions the characters make that can see annoying, or lead to a problem but they are portrayed realistically in the way two teenagers going through the scenario would act.
Art - 10
The art is absolutely beautiful, aside from just the beautiful scenery in the landscapes and design in buildings. Many scenes are just astounding to pause and look at the detail in design and art, lighting and story telling in the art. Within the first 5 minutes there were already a massive amount of artistically beautiful scenes. Early on there is a panning shot around a small room that not only shows off the room and the character development through that but pans incredibly smoothly for a hand drawn sequence. This as well as multiple time lapses, zooms, pans and generally outstanding design.
Sound - 10
The soundtrack and voice acting is amazing. The soundtrack is profound, beautifully made, full of heart and each song fits what is visually or emotionally happening. I still find myself listening to Zen Zen Zense and Yumetourou especially. And the voice acting is realistic and believable.
Enjoyment - 10
This movie is a joyous and heart wrenching roller coaster. I found myself silently filled with the beauty of it, intrigued and involved in the characters, plot and theme, smiling from ear to ear, relieved, shocked (yes, shocked.) and then overwhelmed by the melancholy of finishing a movie/tv show/anime after connecting with it, and the happiness of viewing such a film. I enjoyed every bit of this movie. I was drawn in instantly from the silent begining to the joyous end.
Overall - 10
One of the most amazing films I've ever watched, without a doubt a Masterpiece of storytelling, art, character design and more. All awards and praise towards this movie are definitely deserved. I'd recommend this film to absolute anyone. The hype does not disappoint in the slightest.",10,HyperJ

                This was, hands down, THE BEST ANIME I'VE EVER WATCHED and I'm not even new to anime. Been an otaku since 2008 and throughout all the years of watching the same repetitive plot of anime watching this movie was a breather! It has the best plot twist I've ever seen! I liked the part where I couldn't predict what was going to happen, unlike in other anime which was predictable somehow. And the unique storytelling about dreams in Japanese, I loved it! That is what I was looking for in anime! Something unpredictable and edging over our seats! The climax also got me hooked. It
                  also made me want to experience the same thing. Also, the ending! God! The ending! I thought it would stop there but no! ""Kimi no Nawa"" IS A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED MUST WATCH, WHETHER YOU'RE AN OTAKU OR NOT. AGAIN, HANDS DOWN.",10,YoungDongSun_

                Im gonna keep this review as short as possible
This anime is a symbol of this era. It completely obliterates every other love story out there in terms of coincidence and overall enjoyment.
i came to this movie with extremely high expectations, not expecting to be disappointed in any way possible. and boy did i get what i wanted. Until the very end i was holding my breath. This movie met my every expectation in every way possible and will remain a masterpiece forever.
I highly highly recommend you watch this movie because the sheer creativity and story will blow your mind. This only got a 10/10 because
                  i couldnt give it  20/10. Its an extremely heartwarming movie and might leave you crying. 
Its worth the watch. That's it. Doubting whether this movie will be a good fir for you or not is one of the easiest ways to deprive yourself of an amazing experience which you will get addicted to and not want anything else.

                Having never really seen any Anime before watching this movie (except from Pokemon and Dinosaur King when I younger), I didn't really have any expectations going into this. My family have a subscription to Amazon prime, and 'Your Name' was on there for free. Expecting at least a decent watch, what i saw instead was a Masterpiece in cinema, that I'll no doubt continue to love more and more as the years go on as I re-watch it.
Story:
The story starts out as a typical 'Slice of Life' kind of thing, except the main 2 characters from separate areas of Japan start swapping bodies with each
                  other. Anyone who sees a DVD or Blu-ray of this movie knows this. But, something unexpected happens which tips the story on it's head and drives up the suspense and mystery. Don't read up anything about the plot. It leaves a lot of questioning and wonder which makes for an engrossing plot leaves you wanting more.
Art:
The art style is among the most beautiful I've ever seen. As an artist myself, I love seeing beautiful art, no matter what the medium is. The colors are vibrant, there is a lot of contrast in light and dark shades, the light sources are very realistic, which makes everything shine and glisten. The character designs are among the best I've ever seen, as they are simplistic, yet still contain plenty of detail so the viewer is never left wondering what a certain object is. The animation is very fluid, but can also become very rigid when it needs to.
Characters: 
This is probably my favorite aspect of 'Your Name'. I fell in love and related with the characters so much and if anything tense or bad happened to them, I felt their pain and wanted nothing more than to see them pull through and come out the other end fine. Never in any kind of movie (live action, animated) have I ever felt this way about any of the characters, and that really says a lot of about the writing and voice acting. These aren't even physical people on the screen, and I'm getting worked up about them like I've known them for years
Sound:
I've been listening to the music quite a lot recently, and it's really beautiful. Mesmerizing piano melodies, soulful string sections, with even some playful chords and melodies to match the more lighthearted and playful parts of the movie. It even has 2 original J-Pop songs that I've been really enjoying as of recently.
Enjoyment:
As you can probably already tell, I'm in love with this movie. I've never loved a movie's characters and plot as much as this. The plot takes many twists and turns, but never strays away from the true message of the film, and keeps you on your toes and keeps you hooked and in love with the whole package
Overall:
This movie is a true masterpiece of cinema and rightfully deserves all the awards it's received. This is a movie that has nothing wrong with it. No flaws or things I wish they'd done differently or better. I'm looking forward to more re-watches of the movie.",10,TheShadowKnows31

                Kimi no na wa
It really took me quite a while until I could watch this movie. I did not really believe that it could be as I had been described. A tremendous piece of art.
Kimi no Na wa, as many films do not, surrounds you from the beginning to the end, mixing a fantasy story with ancient Japanese beliefs, an art worthy of praise and a soundtrack that for me, is perfect from start to finish.
The animation and quality of the graphics are incredible, from small details in the characters, to great details of scenery and animation fluency.
As for the story, scripts, among other important
                  technical things, I think it was taken in an interesting way, always leaving unknowns, details in the idioms of speech, gestures, variations in time, and many more details that you can only appreciate if you see it 2 or 3 times. It is spectacular.
Recommended 100% One of those movies that you have to see by general culture, will easily be a classic of Japanese animation.",10,DiegoRkz

                ENG/PT-BR
ENG :
What is visually beautiful is the same amount of script errors:
• Taki is not a well-developed character, he becomes forgettable when he is not in Mitsuha's body;
• With two cell phones in hand, how did they not notice that they were both living at different times? Especially Mitsuha when you weren't in Taki's body in Tokyo didn't you see any subways / trains on the banners and other places in the city registered in 2016? In this universe there are no applications? Is there no car of the year? nothing to show or what they live on?
• Supporting characters don't have a ""life of
                  their own"", if I reach out to you and say we're going to explode in a bank, would you? of course not!
They are already friends of Mitsura without asking any questions, doing something like that, using explosives to blow up a city energy reserve, breaking into a radio and evacuating people just because of Mitsura said and also because of the script anyway they do to use a friendly ending to the general public;
It would be more coherent to make Mitsura convince an exchange or party location for a school saying that it would be more comfortable for everyone, as it causes a more defined space and the like, does not do all this maracutaia above to give an ""excitement"" in the anime;
• A reaction from the character Okudera, Miki bothers me a lot for not being natural, imagine how to call your girlfriend to an indoor location asking to remove a skirt that I will calculate in that location? It is obvious that she could not take the same out if she were gay because she was not intimate with her, but also question me why a restaurant has different colored threads and a sewing needle?
And another point, why doesn't this restaurant have clothes reserved for its employees? we know that because of the hustle and bustle as waiters sometimes get dirty like clothes and that there is always a reserved outfit so that it does not give an impression to customers in restaurants;
PT-BR:
O que ele tem de bonito visualmente é a mesma quantidade de seus erros de roteiro:
• Taki não é um personagem bem desenvolvido, chega a ser esquecivel quando não está no corpo de Mitsuha;
• Como eles dois com celulares em mãos não notaram que ambos estavam vivendo em épocas diferentes? Principalmente Mitsuha quando estava no corpo do Taki em Tókio não viu no metrô/trêm nos banners e outros lugares da cidade anúncios de eventos em 2016? Nesse universo não há anúncios? Não há carro do ano? nada que mostre o ano que eles vivem?
• Os personagens de apoio não tem ""vida própria"", se eu chegar para você e dizer que vamos explodir um banco, você iria? claro que não!
Já os amigos de Mitsura sem fazer nenhum questionamento fizeram algo parecido, usar explosivos para explodir a reserva de energia da cidade, invadir a rádio e evacuar pessoas só porquê a Mitsura disse e também porquê o roteiro precisava de qualquer maneira fazer eles sobreviverem para ter um final amigável ao grande público;
Seria mais coerente fazer Mitsura convencer a trocar o local do festejo para a escola dizendo que seria mais comodo para todos pois teriam um espaço mais dicado e afins, não fazer toda essa maracutaia de cima só para dar uma ""empolgação"" no anime;
• A reação da personagem Okudera, Miki me incomdou demais por não ser natural, imagina eu chamar sua namorada para um local fechado pedir para retirar a saia que vou costurar naquele local? É obvio que ela não iria tirar mesmo se fosse gay porquê não tem nenhuma intimidade com ela também fico me questionando porquê um restaurante tem linhas de cores diferentes e agulha de costura?
E outro ponto, porquê esse restaurante não tem uma roupa reserva para seus funcionários? sabemos que por causa da correria as vezes os garçons sujam as roupas e por isso sempre há uma roupa reserva para não dá má impressões aos clientes nos restaurantes;",1,sg001

                Well i've never heard of this movie until I saw it took #1 in the ratings on this site so I decided to check it out. I went in knowing next to nothing other than it was a romance, but boy was I in for a tsunami of emotions (I feel like a ""rollercoaster of emotions"" is too weak to describe it). As of right now when i'm writing this review, this movie has the highest rating on the site at a 9.40, and rightfully so, I think. The quality of this movie is pretty top notch, this is one of the first few things
                  I've watched where I have nothing to complain about, absolutely brilliant. The things I could nitpick are exceedingly  petty so i'm not even going to bother with it. 
If you're contemplating whether you should watch this or not, then you need to stop what you're doing and just watch it. The only people who I could see not enjoying this movie are those who don't enjoy the romance genre. But even if you don't, I would definitely give this a chance (personally I'm not a fan of the genre myself but this movie is certainly a huge exception). This movie does start off and draws you in pretty quickly so you'll know whether you'll like it or not within the first 20 minutes or less.",10,Aezis
32281,"
                I really loved the movie. First, let me say that I am not a fan of movie like this.  endings of a movies like this  would last for some time which make me feel uncomfortable lol. I used to binge watching animes like clannad boku ga inai machi , ect... and those animes would always last way too long in my head!  
So I usually watch anime like kuroko no basket, uchu kyodai and such
these shonnen anime are always clean cut goal focused, good ending, giving you motivations haha
anyways I wrote too many things that is not the point. what I am
                  trying to say is this movie was that good that I still decided to watch it and I could not take my eyes off until the end. It has this vibe that you feel like you want them to get together but they probably won't lol So you constantly feel nervous about how they are going to end. 
the ending was beautiful and the maker of the movie definitely knows how to move someone else's heart. That feeling when you are waiting for that moment to come is what he was playing around with and he is really good at it. I loved the characters for real. for anime like this ofc they use characters who are not really unique or special. I mean taki was a normal Tokyo boy who is working as a server and the mitsuha was a high school girl who sometimes help her grandmother with the shrine rituals annually. 
It's the story that the maker tried to touch and twist. By using normal characters, the movie shows how they feel and react in such a romantic heart warming way. If I write too much things over here it will just ruin the fun. So I will keep it short. But when you finish the movie, you will realize how much the setting can bring out deep romantic feelings from normal characters who would never feel that way or know each other if those settings were not applied. That is why I would like to say this movie is such a nice experiment on what kind of story can appeal the watchers. Just like the name of the movie itself, I can't really seem to remember the side characters names or anything significant about them. they literally scarified for the story and the relationship between the two. But I would say it is worth it. it did make me focus on what the maker wanted me to focus on and it was definitely on point. And it made me realize that you should value ur feelings and thoughts all the time. who knows what those can be tied to? things that are happening to you can be tied to someone else life at some point of your life and I am not talking about fantasy stuff. It is your everyday that affects other people and who knows when what you are feeling can be connected to others even though you never know that person. I believe life is about connecting those threads you can not see. You will feel that too when you watch the end. If you turn your back, thinking that nothing is there it will be nothing. nothing can be special unless you hang on to it. Its the one time you open your heart and try to reach  first that is going to turn into something special",9,jms7178

Story: FUCKING GOOD. Rly, how can someone watch this and say that the history is bad? Think with me - have THAT thing and THAT other thing (it's so fucking bad that i can't say any spoilers xD), she is simple but innovative. But yeah, the history, in the first half, is a bit monotonous. I'M NOT SAIYNG THAT IN THE FIRST HALF THE HISTORY IS NOT GOOD, INSTEAD, this is the part of the movie that u are meeting the characters, knowing what they are doing and their cultures. However, it's in the second half that the movie becomes AWESOME. 10/10
Art: I
                  believe they done the opening only to demonster how the anime was pretty. Rly, the scenarios are soooo beautiful. Tokyo have so much detail, the illumination is pretty too and the place that the female protagonist lives (i don't remember the name, sry) is the most beautiful place in the movie, in my opinion. 10/10
Sound: Radwimps... U're the best, rly. There is not much to talk about this category, if you want something more concrete, just type radwimps in google xD. 10/10
Characters: I know you've been waiting for me to talk about the protagonists. Yes, if you are reading this review and do not know anything about kimi no na wa, there are two protagonists, a man and a woman, both of the same age, students. They focus more on the female one in the first part... then they go and focus on the male character... and in the end they focus on the two. The more people I know who watched this movie, the more I discover that the male protagonist is most adored. Not because of it being more developed than the female or something, but the part that starts focusing on him, in the middle of the show more or less, is the part where the movie engages and gets good to the end. And yeah, the male is my favorite too S2. 9/10
Enjoyment: The seventh best anime i ever seen, i will not even discuss this topic. 10/10
Overall: This website does not have decimal notes, so i can not give the note i wanted, but I also recognize that it is not a grade 10 (i only recognize because I have a critical sense, because if it's only my opinion ... it's 10), so i will give .. FUCK OFF IT'S 10.",10,FlyPintim

                Your Name is a story of two halves, the good, and the bad, which makes it a bit of a disappointment, since it’d have been an overall much more enjoyable experience, had they taken one idea and stuck with it for its entirety, but, even if half good and half bad, at least it’s not ugly. As for the story, to keep it short, a bloke from Tokyo, and a shrine maiden from some unimportant place that isn’t Tokyo find themselves swapping bodies every so often because the shrine maiden shouted that she wanted to be a bloke while stood under a Shinto arch, or
                  at least that’s as much of an explanation as any of us are getting, but there’s no need to get all hung up on details, what’s important is it happens, and when it does happen, they have difficulty acting normally, since if you quite literally aren’t yourself then trying to be yourself isn’t a particularly easy thing to do, though they don’t really seem to have it too bad, there isn’t much humour in their difficulty trying to act normally, nor is there some social message about putting on personas and basing your behaviour around that of others, or anything like that, if losing your mind is this ineffectual, then I don’t really know why we need mental institutions. 
So, it’s easier than it perhaps otherwise could be, one reason being that they refreshingly don’t waste too much of the viewer’s time with absolute insistence that it’s a series of dreams, and, for anime characters, they are surprisingly pragmatic, writing each other reports and shit, but, this is how it goes for the first half of the film, and, all things considered, they both seem to somewhat dislike each other, which is somewhat understandable, if someone incidentally got into my body and started doing whatever it is they felt like for a day and then wiping my memory, I wouldn’t like them that much either, whether it was their fault or not. 
The second half, instead, tries to be some La Jetee meets Back To The Future ordeal, with a meteor strike crashing into the small village in which the shrine maiden lives, promptly stopping her from being able to live there, and the bloke having to go back in time and evacuate everyone so that they aren’t killed, which is a bit strange actually, this wasn’t set in the 1300’s, they had meteorological technology, they had news reports, they very clearly knew that the meteor was coming, but they didn’t even attempt to evacuate, because why? There was a festival going on? Can’t say I’ve ever lived in a place that’s been in danger of a meteor strike, but I would imagine that they evacuate so long as there is a chance of a crash, because, it’s quite clearly the sensible option, either make everyone potentially waste a few hours, or potentially allow everyone to die, I know the mayor, who happens to be the shrine maiden’s father wasn’t exactly the smartest chap out there, but smart enough to do this, a bit of a strange one as well, his daughter tells him that a meteor’s going to strike and that he needs to evacuate the town, and how does he react? Accusing her of being sick? A bit questionable to me, a response that dismissive is somewhat at odds with the completely functional modern family he’s meant to be a part of, but I guess every teenage romance needs stupid parents, who, like, totally, just don’t understand anything.
But, in essence, the latter half is dedicated to the shrine maiden, who’s actually the bloke in her body, for the record, trying to avert the future, and it’s just not as good as the first half, maybe with more refinement and a story that could have been completely avoided had the local council not been completely and unrealistically incompetent, but it’s whatever. Speaking of body swapping, here’s an interesting question for you – who are you, really? Is it your body or your mind that makes you, you? A question that seems a natural fit for something like Your Name, but they didn’t ask that question, so I’m not going to answer it.
Now, the finale comes after a 5 year timeskip, when both of them have completely moved on from what happened that day, and are just living their normal lives, but then, they see each other, and it’s suggested that then they love each other and get together, the end, which seems a bit contrived to me. First of all, I don’t believe they ever even saw each other’s faces, so how they even knew who the other one was is something beyond explanation. But, more importantly, how am I meant to believe that they have some undying love for each other? Love is a contract, two people like each other so they decide to spend time together, but these two people don’t like each other, they’ve caused each other nothing but misery, this whole thing could be amended if the bloke said “well shit guess she’s dead nothing I can do”, it’s not like his life benefitted from being the shrine maiden or anything, with the possible exception being that one time when he did, she went on a date with one of his coworkers, but that relationship never went anywhere, so not much help, really. In essence, I’m meant to believe these people love each other, when they don’t, they haven’t even physically met each other, they do not have any reason to love each other, say what you want about contrived fujoshi fanfiction, at least those people follow the natural fucking order – you meet someone, and then you love them, and not the other way around. 
There’s also the visuals to consider, and they are definitely a sight to behold, this is the same director behind 5cm/s, and therein he did a very good job of utilising framing in an effective manner, whereas this has been considerably lessened here, but replaced with a clear increase in budget and higher visual fidelity, I wouldn’t necessarily consider this either an upgrade or a downgrade, it would have been great if we could have both, but, it certainly looks impressive, can’t deny that. I don’t really think we needed about 5 AMVs to be included throughout, any more than 2 and they start to lose their flavour, but, that’s a minor complaint, they were fine, and utimately, Your Name isn’t bad, it’s just weak. It dedicates its latter half to a story that isn’t as compelling as the one it began with, and had a poor ending, it’s a disappointment, more than anything else, all the ingredients for something spectacular are here, but what I got was not spectacular, it was just kind of weak.",5,SCLFI

                I absolutely loved Your Name (Kimi no Na Wa) because of its gorgeous artwork and compelling story. Unfortunately, I watched this movie way to late and one of the big plot twists was spoiled for me (more on that later). So just warning you, there is going to be spoilers down here. Okay, on with the show.
Story: 9
Have you ever felt like you are looking for something, but can never actually grasp what you are looking for? Your Name is about these star-crossed lovers realizing that they are completely perfect for each other and fall in love in the best way possible. By switching bodies.
                  The love story between Taki and Mitsuha is extremely heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. This movie is admittedly kind of boring in the first scenes, but it gets much better after they realize that they are switching bodies. The way they begin to fall for each other is kind of sudden, but you are able to understand how they would want to look for each other. What can I say? This movie is so good that I ignore all the plot holes of the story. The story is not the best, but when you watch the movie, you won't care. You'll love this movie for what it is. The ending is not satisfying because you want so much more. You want to see them actually fall in love all over again and go on dates and get married. Even though I wasn't satisfied, the ending is perfect to a pretty much perfect movie. 
Art: 10
This may be cheating, but Your Name has probably the best art I've ever seen (It's cheating because it's a movie, not a show). The CGI is not too noticeable, in fact, it looks amazing. Everything is so beautifully animated and the visuals are enough to make you cry from its beauty. The characters are drawn so beautifully and the landscapes are breathtaking. In my opinion, this is my favorite art style in anime.
Sound: 10
The music. Oh the music. It's soooooooooo goood. Radwimps did an amazing job with the OST especially with Sparkle and Zenzenzense. It fits in perfectly with the movie, all the cues are just amazingly on point. To be honest, all of it sounds kind of the same, but I don't care. I can listen to Sparkle all day long. The voice acting, at least in Japanese, is really good, At first, it sounds a bit like they're bored, but later on, when the scream, cry, speak, and laugh, it sounds so perfect. It fits their characters so well. All of this tied in with the visuals make the tears flow.
Character: 9
Taki and Mitsuha are the main characters and obviously, they get the most screen time. If only I got to see more of them. Taki with his bored, stoic attitude and Mitsuha as a sweet, innocent, passionate girl. I love them so much. Even so, the supporting characters are just okay. Mitsuha's best friends, Tessie and Sayaka are really good characters and they get just enough screen time to be the best supporting characters. Takagi isn't around too much, but he is very likable. Okudera and Fuji are great and gives a lot of support to Taki and they are so lovable, but they are kind of forced into the movie, especially Takagi. Mitsuha's sister is funny and cute while her grandmother is... there. I cannot give this category a 10 because I think some of these characters needed more screen time to be loved even more.
Enjoyment: 10
After watching Your Name, I was so happy that tears flowed down my eyes for the first time in a while. The only other anime I've cried in is Assassination Classroom because of Korosensei's death :( This movie is my favorite movie period. It's my favorite film, period. This movie could have gone a way where it would crash and burn, but it did everything so perfectly. I think I will watch this movie over and over again just to be satisfied. I love Your Name and I hope there are other movies as good as this one.",10,TwoSwordStyle

I really enjoyed it. The story was original and gave some new experience, loved the songs in the background (even saved some of them in Spotify after). Can't really comment anything about characters, personalities were cool Ig. It was one of the first anime I've watched and it hyped me up and I started watching more and more anime. It wasn't too long and kept the tempting for the whole time! The art was amazing! Beautiful work, nice job. Would love if another like this one could come out because it was incredible!

                I watched kimi no nawa in 4K in a theater and it was very outstanding.

                *Short non-spoiler review*
At the time of writing this review, I've completed over 200 anime series. However, out of all the anime I've watched, none of them have given me the same level of emotions that I felt while watching Your Name.
Some of them have come close. Titles that come to mind are Angel Beats! and the more recent Violet Evergarden. However, Your Name is somehow special. I don't really know how to describe it, but its like the story speaks directly to your heart. I know that doesn't really make much sense, but with words, that is the closest I can come to explaining my
                  experience with this movie.
After finishing this movie for the first time, you're going to experience a wide range of emotions. At the time I was satisfied, joyful, and I'll admit that I dropped a few manly tears. Emphasis on manly. And strangely enough, you might even feel motivated and hopeful.
Lastly, the story itself isn't anything to write home about. In comparison, I would say that Koe no Katachi has a much more well-formed narrative than Your Name, but I don't watch anime for the clever writing or symbolism displayed in the show. I watch it to experience the story, and the emotions that come with it. If you have a similar reason for watching anime, then you should watch this one. You'll thank me later.",10,MScientist0

                “Kimi no na wa” or otherwise known as “Your name” follows our two main characters Mitsuha, a highschool girl from the rural country side, and Taki, a higschool boy from Tokyo, as they unravel the secrets to their strange ability to switch each others bodies in their dreams. The overall story was intriguing and incapacitated the lives of our protagonists in such a heartwarming yet bittersweet manner. The plot was original and had all kinds of elements of surprise which kept me wondering “What in the world is happening?”. Honestly, you won't completely understand the entire film until the very end when you are drowning
                  in tears. The romance in this film truly depicted a sort of first love or young love kind of feel which fit perfectly with our cast. However, I felt as if the beginning was a bit unclear at times on who was in who’s body and the sequence in which the events took place but I feel like this uncertainty reflects the mental state of the main characters since they too were kind of lost and disorientated. Nonetheless, I did wish they could have highlighted more of the daily lives of our characters when they switched bodies. I felt like that could have added to the clarity of the beginning. But if i were to choose to allocate more time to setting up the the plot instead of actually proceeding with the plot, well that would be shitting all over Makoto Shinkai’s grave. The main highlight of the story is the ending or perhaps the climax and after. When all the pieces start falling into place, you truly see the beauty of this film and the depth of meaning behind even the smallest of details. Absolutely when of the best anime films I've seen in the last decade. Highly recommend this!",9,otacoolanime000
32281,"
                YES, I just seriously put 10 for everything again! CAUSE WHY NOT? The movie is amazing. It starts out by subtly playing with the audience's emotions. As the story goes on, that feeling which it seemed to plant inside the audience starts welling up as the Mitsuha and Taki learn more about each other. It may seem like your usual romance story, but be prepared to get your mind blown away by the twists and turns.
The story is really great. The only thing that can slightly be improved is the fact that we didn't get much insight into the personal lives of the main characters,
                  especially Taki's. If they were to spend a little more effort into allowing the audience to get to know the 2 main characters better, the story would be more complete and even more perfect. The pacing is perfect, keeping at a steady pace while not slowing or speeding up to much.
The art is just so amazing and actually quite incredibly realistic. While they did use a bit if CGI, which not everyone is really a huge fan of, they were able to use it in a way of making the movie more unique and interesting, as well as being able to use it at the almost completely perfect timings.
Now for the sound. The music, or should I say songs, that were used totally fit the theme of the movie. As someone who took Music theory and classes, I would give the music an 11 out of 10 or 110% out of 100% if it were just possible.
The characters. The moment I started knowing them more and more, I also fell in love with them more and more. I think I may have even found myself a new waifu XD. Like I said earlier, it would really help a lot if they gave more time on letting the audience know more about the the characters' personal life/story, especially for Taki. Besides from that, I am already out of ideas on how they can improve the characters, because they are quite perfect the way they are already.
For enjoyment, I totally LOVE the entire thing. I am not ashamed in saying that it is the best movie i have ever ever watched in my entire life. It is the most beautiful thing i have ever enjoyed. It makes me feel like i want to have that kind of love story as well. It is an amazing story.
This movie makes me happy that i was alive in the year 2016.

Story: 10
The movie starts of in a light and kinda funny anime mood you'd expect from a slice of life anime. It's fun but seems a bit shallow. You'd think Makoto Shinkai was finally making a movie with a happy ending... But he is Makoto Shinkai!!! Surprising you at the moment you'd expect the least, you are drawn to a world of thrill and mystery and an absolutely beautiful story. Then again, there is the signature Makoto Shinkai ending you'd just expect from him.
Drawbacks: The pacing is a bit fast in the mid part and
                  the developments happen a bit earlier than expected. Also the movie kinda drifts off which leaves you a bit confused in places.
Art: 10
Enthralling, beautiful, elegant and vibrant. My vocabulary fails to describe the beautiful art in this movie. This movie is a masterpiece in this aspect. Just what one would expect from Makoto Shinkai. The vibrant landscape and the realistic city life is just spot on. The character designs are great too.
Drawbacks: None!!!!
Sound: 9
The soundtrack in the movie is very good. There are no unnecessary sound effects and ear pounding tracks. It's just smooth and plain and does the job wonderfully in providing an all round experience to the animation.
Drawbacks: It could have been a bit more deep. The soundtracks in his other movies were a tad better(Like in The Garden of Words)

                This is a story that tries to be a lot of things, but ends up being just a few.
Story: 7
Explaining a synopsis of the story would spoil the whole film, because it's, unfortunately, incredibly easy to guess what will happen, mainly because this isn't an entirely new concept. One would think that a story that is so simple to understand is simple in itself, but it does try to be complicated. It uses the whole concept of telling a story based on vital information that is not known to the viewer, which can be interesting. In this case, though, it just makes the first 15
                  minutes of the movie generally boring.
Despite this I don't dislike the story, I have a bit of a biased love for these kinds of meta-things and so it is still quite enjoyable. Sure, it's got a deus ex machina that is just so out of place, and it feels like the only reason it exists is to make the characters say the movie title, but it's possible to ignore it and still enjoy the film.
Art: 9
I don't have much to say here. It looks very modern, but it's got a twist that makes it memorable. It's no Jojo or Samurai Champloo when it comes to recognisable originality but it's not bad because of that.
Sound: 6
(I watched this in japanese, there's no point watching it in english and the swedish dub is voiced by some weeb pop star who sings kinda awfully so I don't want to watch it at all)
Here is where a lot of people will probably disagree with me...
The shoujo-like opening/montage is out of place and made me pull up my phone to surf twitter due to being boring, and the background music is literally just background music, no originality or recognisability to it whatsoever. I didn't remember any of the music when the movie was over.
The voice actors aren't bad, but it's very obvious that, especially the main characters, aren't voiced by people with a lot of experience. This is nitpicking and if this was a western animation I wouldn't complain. I also understand there's not as much money invested in movies as there are in anime-series, but this just annoys me slightly throughout the movie.
Character: 5
I don't care about the characters in this story at all. No effort is made for me to want to care about their lives because there's so much effort made in trying to confuse me with the story, there's just no place for giving the characters personality and development. Unfortunately, the story is built so that towards the end of the movie I'm supposed to care about the main characters, and that just makes the lack of character development all too clear. 
Enjoyment: 8
I find it on par with other things I've rated 8, and I do rate based on how much I enjoyed watching the animation. I liked it, I didn't have an urge to shut the movie down despite the low res, and you know, it still has its moments. It's overrated but it isn't bad. The art is definitely part of why I liked it, but the story is still engaging despite its predictability.
Overall: 8
Yeah, it's not bad. For a movie, where there's so little time to develop both story and characters it didn't do bad, although it could've definitely prioritised differently. I rate sound an 8, but the music is still fitting to the story and pulls you in, it's your very normal background music and it fits very well.",8,SweTovah

                With a very high expectation from the community and all with all the hype going, this anime fails to deliver and dreadful.
The story is 1/10 wherein its rushed and so many details not included thats it leaves plot holes and inconsistent storyline. Like yeah they have a gender swap and they help each other BUT the most annoying is how they fell in love. Like a moment ago theyre just helping each other and then suddenly they fell in love with even metting each other? Their love story seems forced and the anime fails to deliver a story where viewers can feel that the love
                  is natural. Just because of this one scene it ruined the whole point of the story like they're just shoving like ""here you go, you guys are in love now"". 
Art and the music is really enjoyable but the directing and storytelling is what really makes an anime entertaining to me. 
So I'll give this a 1/10 overall rating for the fact that the rating is so high when the story is a mess just to lower the rating for the sake of othe deserving anime.",2,Iroha_Pixie
32281,"
                Kimi no Na wa, or ""Your Name"", leaves me with only two words to describe my thoughts immediately after viewing: impressively unimpressive. It is a beautiful, beautiful product, a masterful combination of film-like cinematography and anime's best in coloring, shading, and rendering motion and vista. If you were to watch it mute, you'd still be left in awe of just how lovely the animation is--but that would be cruel as well, as the sound design and music serves perfectly to compliment every piece of motion, every pebble cast aside and twig snapped, the sliding door of wood in the town and metal of the trains
                  of the city. 
But animation does not save a product's story, the most important asset of any piece of media. Simply put, it's dull. There's no real substance to it. Some concepts are interesting (and others, not so much) but the execution lacks any real meat to it, instead leaving the movie feeling more like an inoffensive boardroom creation. The characters themselves are nothing. A small assembly of side characters makes up those who support the two main heroes, but they are devoid of any roundness. Attempting to describe any of the side characters in more than five traits is an impossible task. Now, do not mistake my words to mean that every character blasted onto a projector screen demands to have a fully realized arc--this is silly and not always true. However, if the side characters are merely going to be two dimensional support beams for the protagonists, they better be amazingly realized and fully fleshed out. 
They are not.
Mitsuha, the female protagonist of the story, has an interesting premise to her at first. She feels trapped in a scenario in which she serves the temple while her father serves the government, leading her to desire fleeing this lifestyle and seek a new one in the city. Taki, the male protagonist, has absolutely nothing. He's just a guy. A dude. A stand-in. Funnier, Mitsuha's premise is soon dropped as the center of attention revolves around their trading places, but there's nothing REALLY done with it. It's all just sort of goofy and silly and then it's over. Her premise seems dropped even as she doesn't seem to have any more of an issue living where she does, so... was the beginning just a bad day for her or something? The issue becomes that their characters pretty much just become devotees to each other no more than forty minutes in, and the rest of the story is just that empty, senseless devotion. They're open ended enough so that anyone can juxtapose themselves onto the girl or boy, thinking ""Oh, he's just like me... I would do that for my love..."" A symptom of a movie trying as genuinely hard as it can to reach widespread appeal, I guess.
The other main issue is that the concept is quite interesting, but handled very poorly. The movie is based around the concept of not only switching bodies, but switching timelines, and there is magic there. However, it becomes bogged down not only with a boring romance (as discussed above) but the concept of losing memories, an enormously unnecessary plot motif that serves no other purpose than to... what, exactly? Confuse people? Make it seem more heart wretched? Give me a break. It's an annoying concept that does nothing for the movie whatsoever, and, in fact, little about the movie would change regardless of whether someone could remember a name. Let me go a step further: it is my firm belief that this ridiculous plot element exists only so that they could call the movie Your Name. That's it. That's the only reason. I would bet sums on this.
In conclusion, give me a movie that plays up the duality of time travel and body swapping along with more realized characters--and if you're going to crowbar in a romance, do so LATER in the movie when everyone has been more than fleshed out--but not this.",6,proxime

                When I watched this late 2017 (by late, I mean December-end-of-the-year late), I didn't really know what to expect. Kimi no Na wa was a film that, at least I heard, was nominated for multiple awards not just in Japan, but in the UNITED STATES. So if it reached out to people across nations, it had to be good, right? But, how good?
Absolutely spectacular. There's not much words to describe it other than one of the most enjoyable piece of animated film I have ever seen, topping most if not ALL Pixar Movies for me, and heck, even  Miyazaki's works. Makoto Shinkai is a
                  genius, and although he has been very humble about Your Name's success (I can respect that), it is truly my favorite movie of not only 2017, but of all time. Here's why.
Story: 9
The story has strong ties to Japanese culture, so for the average foreign viewer they may not understand what some of the elements are, especially parts when they incorporate the language and the dialects they use, which aren't present in English. However, since I have watched my fair share of anime (like, 25-30. That's scratching the surface, but whatever), I understood the portrayal quite easily. The twists and turns the story takes you on messed with my emotions, and it was basically an emotional rollercoaster all the way through; always moving, never letting you rest for too long. 
Makoto Shinkai, while he does make excellent slice-of-life movies, some, more specifically his longer films, are known to be slow. There were...a few slower parts (which is why this is the only part that isn't a perfect 10), but it is made up with quite literally everything else, which is why I gave it the score I did.
Art: 10
If I could give an Over 9000 I would. The art is honestly a lot more aesthetic than REAL LIFE. No joke. Screenshots don't do this movie justice. It's beautiful, surpassing every anime I've seen. Every five seconds felt worthy of a wallpaper, and the way the characters fit into this gorgeous environment is really natural. From the green forests to the concrete jungles, Makoto Shinkai NAILED the Art.
Sound: 10
More like a 12 to me. RADWIMPS, the band that made the soundtrack for the movie, worked in tandem with Shinkai since the early stages of the movie, making sure that their music fit in with Shinkai's animation. And it really did. The music did as much to sell me on this movie than the Art and Story combined; the amazing slow-rock songs were quite honestly one of my favorite parts of this movie. I would know, I bought the whole soundtrack as soon as the movie ended. 
I think what I have to compare Your Name's soundtrack with is My Hero Academia's. Yes, they are very different, which is why I'm contrasting them. Your Name's music feels like it fits in with JUST Your Name. No other movie can just take Dream Lantern (The movie's opening song) and put it with their scenes and expect it to work. On the other hand, MHA's soundtrack is comparatively different, more specifically the track You Say Run. If you've been on YouTube for more than 5 minutes, you would notice that people put that track over practically any fight scene from any anime, and it goes perfectly with it (in fact, there's a scene in Your Name where You Say Run goes well with. Not telling where). It's generic, not saying generic is a bad thing, but it takes away from the heart of that song. Meanwhile, since RADWIMP's soundtrack is so unique that it only goes with one film, the heart is never taken away, as whenever the listener hears ""Nandemonaiya"", they don't think of that one scene in MHA's 2nd episode (for those who watched it you know what I'm talking about), they think of Your Name. That's why it deserves a perfect 10.
P.S. The voice acting for the Japanese and English versions were superb as well.
Character: 10
Some people think this is the weakest part of the film, saying that the characters are too shallow, or simple to really relate to. That they don't have any complex problems with their lives. But that's the thing: They're teenagers, barely making into their senior year (last I checked they were 17). Do you think you had any big issues in your life when you were 17 besides worrying about college? Not really. They don't have to have big problems because they're too young to have big problems. This movie was aimed at the adolescent, which is why this movie spoke to me a lot more than it spoke to, say, my parents. I had a blast because I related to them. The movie did perfect with the audience is was mainly trying to focus to, which is why I also gave this section a 10.
Enjoyment/Overall: 10 (but actually infinity)
Like I said, this was my favorite movie of all time. I don't really need to say anything more other than, if you haven't watched it, watch it as soon as possible. It is truly a masterpiece among the titans of Japanese animation.",10,SSJacen35

                NOTE: TL;DR for a quick summary at bottom | I keep my reviews SHORT
I give Kimi no Na Wa a 9.8/10 (10)
(May contain spoilers) WOW! Shinkai Makoto does it again. First it was with '5cm per second', then with 'Garden of words' and now 'Kimi no Na Wa. This is an absolute masterpiece. The whole feeling of this anime immerses you into an extraordinary scenes of wishes as dramatic feelings.
Story:
The story follows 2 high school students. Taki and Mitsuha. Taki is from Tokyo, who is aspiring to be an architect whilst also working at an italian restaurant. Mitsuha is from the countryside in an
                  small town with great tradition and culture. Mitsuha is fed up of her life in the country side so she wants to move to Tokyo as soon as she graduates. They both start swapping day-to-day lives when a comet is sighted in Japan. In order to help each other out, they leave memos and drawings on each other so the other person understands when they make up from each other bodies. This comet changes the lives of each other when Taki finds out that the Mitsuha he knew existed 3 years ago. Desperately in search for her, Taki would do anything to be re-united with her.
The story is very beautiful and emotional. Its a journey of where love wants them to be together but fate can't. I have to admit, this is one of the most unique and metaphorical stories i've seen. 
Art:
Art is mind-blowing as always. You'd expect that from a Shinkai movie. The art was so immersive and good-looking that I don't think I've ever seen an anime as good as this since 'Garden of words' which was of course, another Shinkai movie. Everything looked beautiful, from the shadow reflections, to the depth of field that was shown in this movie.
Sound:
This is not your ordinary, piano-slash-violin melodic tune that you'd expect from previous Shinkai movies. It's more J-Rock than classical. Although, I'm not a huge J-Rock fan, I really didn't mind it. In fact, I enjoyed the music that was played throughout this movie. The OST was very well-done and beautiful.
Character:
There isn't really a lot of cast but the story develops on 2 main characters. We share their feelings and dreams as they both try to help each other out in daily life and then eventually try to meet up with each other. But then again, 2 characters from different backgrounds, different timelines made this movie really impressive. The voice acting was done superb for both of them. They both showed their feelings in an not so over-the-top dramatic way which made it feel so real.
Enjoyment:
I enjoyed the movie VERY MUCH. I enjoyed it so much that It's now added to my top 10 list at 2nd place. I really didn't want this movie to end. But we all know, good things must come to an end. The ending played out perfectly. (5 cm spoiler) I seriously thought they were going to play the ending like how they did in 5cm per second. THANK GOD they didn't.
Overall:
Overall this is a masterpiece. Enough said. If you haven't seen it, you must watch it when it releases on DVD. I would gladly say that this deserves its number 1 rank on MyAnimeList (As of 19/09/2016) and should continue to stay there. It beats all the other movies such as spirited away simply by how amazing this story was. If I could ask for something to be improved, I'd say add more detail to the minor characters but nonetheless, this was an awesome movie.

Kimi no Na wa is a movie that gives you the animation you loved from Garden of Words along with the story you wish you had from 5 centimeters per second.

The first 3 minutes and 3 seconds of this movie had me fall in love with it before anything even really happened. The story is extremely original and has a quality that puts it in the same tier with

                I now see why this movie is such an explosive gargantuan hit in Japan. I don't think I can write very much for this review.
Firstly, it's because watching Kimi no Na Wa is like going on a journey - one where each person takes away something exclusive to them and them only. The best way to experience it is by watching it right away rather than holding off and reading some lengthy review written by some random jerkoff on the Internet before doing so.
Secondly, I feel that an analytical and constructive review would defeat this movie's point. I think it's best that this review stays
                  as short and sweet as the movie itself. I'm not sure how to describe it, but maybe the best word to capture the essence of Kimi no Na Wa is, um...
""serendipity""?
Story & Writing:
Something about Kimi no Na Wa has touched my heart so deeply and gently that I am more than willing to overlook just about every and any flaw its story or writing has. As I've said before, in the first place, if you're looking for ultra-realism and flawless plot threads in Kimi no Na Wa, you're missing the point. The ""point"" you should be looking for is something a lot more heartfelt and ephemeral, something that strikes a resounding chord in the your heart, producing a sound that you cannot consciously perceive. Only after you've seen the movie, and you take a step back to muse, do you realize - that something, or someone, somewhere, has changed forever. 
Art:
Oh my fucking god. 
Throw out everything you thought you knew about ""good"" animation. All that shit belongs in the trash. Everything - from the color palette to the backgrounds, the special effects, the character designs, and most of all, the cinematography - they all exist for one purpose:
To show you the sheer unadulterated awe you once felt upon seeing anime for the very first time.
Sound:
Kimi no Na Wa is chock full of melancholic, bittersweet and emotional tracks that impeccably completes every scene they start playing in. If the visuals is the moon then the sound is the stars - and what's the moon without the stars?
Enjoyment:

                This is the best movie I have ever watched. Not by much, but by enough. Everything about this movie is simply stellar in every way.
Story is solid, leaving bits open to interpretation while also offering ways for things to happen as they do. Twists are great and fantastically executed.
Art and music are some of the best I've seen in anything. 90% of this movie could be paused and show a masterpiece of art.
Characters make sense, feel real, and are very lovable.
Enjoyment is very high, lots of emotional moments and humor. A thoroughly touching ending to top it off.
Simply outstanding.

                Eyecandy! but where is the substance?
What really grinds my gear are two main things
The two maincharacters:
After watched this I cannot simply define the personalities of the two protagonists... For me they are buck standard cardboard shells of people. Sure the female wanted to adventure out of the city and she was trapped between family and traditions and her dreams of getting out... but what was really her dreams? besides the standard ""I wanna get away from the city""..
The male protagonist I feel like that I can even less describe, though he was more a classic dorky male type that needed some help from his ""winggirl""
                  to be able to get a date.
The grounds for their love.
Why did they even fall for one another ? Besides (Spoilers) sharing one anothers life? (And she having boobs). but again what was so special about their life? their hobbies? their interest? their dreams and hopes? their failures and strenghts?

The characters almost all are well crafted.And the music is top notch.The visuals are amazing.The story is complex and requires time to get but with all that is happening in the film you are mostly concerned about the characters and

                Podemos hablar de esta historia de dos formas distintas: basándonos en solo nuestro disfrute sobre la misma, o basándonos en lo que nos habían contado que iba a ser: Escojo ambas.
Hablando sobre lo que cuentan: Es terriblemente decepcionante que la película muestre este desempeño y sin embargo la pongan en ese pedestal que considero, no merece. Sin embargo no voy a tratarle tan mal, que no es su culpa que la hayan sobrevalorado sin querer.
Historia (8): todos saben de lo que trata, pero es tan creativo la forma de manejar y desenvolver la historia del tiempo que es atrayente, por este punto todo bien. Está
                  muy bien, aunque realmente se me hizo tan complejo que tardé en entender.
Arte (10): Muy bonito todo, mis ojos quedaron bien abiertos todo el camino colores y animación brutales y expresiones justas, simplemente satisfactorio.
Sonido(8): A mucha gente le pareció una obra de arte, pero opino que no realmente aunque si sea bonito, bastante subjetivo, hace un buen trabajo y todo no me malinterpreten que si está muy bien.
Personajes(6): Estoy muy bien con Mitsuha y todo, pero ¿Y Taki? No hay tanto desarrollo como me gustaría y los secundarios en su mayoría parecen medio tontos cuando les conviene, los principales son muy agradables pero de ahí no sale mucho más. Alegremente puedo decir que me encariñé algo con los protagonistas.
Disfrute(9): Al momento de verla me gustó mucho, era como: ""por favor logren su meta chicos, sé que pueden"". El final es más que agradable a mi parecer (Terminando como se espera pero no de la forma en la que se espera), solo que habían cosas que no se entendía pero de ahí en más sin analizarla mucho en el momento de verla todo correctísimo.
General(7.5) aunque terminé poniéndole un 7 jajaja: el disfrute y lo visual fueron lo que evitó que decayera mucho más sin embargo los personajes son una cosa importante para mi, hubiera llegado a un 9 si no fuera por eso.
Conclusión: Mírala tranquilo, no esperes que te salgan con la obra maestra de la que te hablaron pero sé que te va a gustar.",7,IamCheri

                I started watching Kimi no Na wa without knowing what to expect. I had thought that this would be one of those typical romance story but I didn't mind as long as the artwork was good, and this anime really caught me by surprise (in a good way). 
The fun part about this movie is that it keeps giving me little surprises as the story unfolds - and I called it 'fun' because the way they switch bodies is really fun to watch. Halfway through the drama the real plot starts to unfold and that's when the story gets really interesting. Although it may seem
                  complicated at certain points but I was glued to the screen wanting to know if it will be a happy ending.
All in all this is a very entertaining anime movie with great story, great characters and one that can be enjoyed by all (unless you're not into animes).",9,Elle29

Ever had that dream where you can't remember anything and just having that feeling that you forgot something important.
I definitely do. 
Art - 10
Definitely one of the best animation out there in the world. Nothing else to say like really...
Sound - 10
The sound is literally a perfect tune for this movie I can't imagine having any other soundtracks. The ending song hit me so hard I almost got a heart attack.

I don't really care about this one... There are some flaws here and there but whatever I don't care...

STORY - 10 (I WOULD GIVE INFINITY IF CAN)
The story makes an emotionless boy like me cry the f**k up like a b**ch. (I can't express my feeling without cursing so....)
So the story is DEFINITELY 10/10 but the main point is that the movie actually doesn't determine the ending... The ending is in your brain... What you actually think about this anime defines the anime. Imagination is LIMITLESS...
Maybe they become friends without knowing the past? Maybe they walked away afterwards without contacting each other?... the options and details is limitless...
and that's exactly why I like the Movie... I would be lying if I said I like having the movie not have a proper ending but this is FINE... not good but FINE
Do you ever had that moment when every details of the dream came back after you saw something exactly in the dream.
That is how I imagine what the ending will be...

                The story of the movie is very good, there are only two things I wanted to mention is; one is in a midway of the movie where I personally feel it was rushed. Second is the ending for the movie, I felt, again, a bit rushed. It was not bad but the impression that gave me was ""oh? it ended?"". 8/10
Not much to say about the artwork because is just amazingly beautiful.

The voice acting was great also the soundtracks of the movie, the way put in the film was like anime whereas there were an OP and EP to separate the event that was going
                  on.

The character was good but normal, that is the character themselves felt lacking some character traits. As Taki is just an average high school boy with good drawing skill while Mitsuha an average high school girl is also a shrine maiden. I personally want to know more than just that.
8/10
The overall the movie was great. I would like it better if it was a anime series, as I like to know more about the story also the film felt short for its story, but this is definitely a great film to enjoy, as an emotional, fantasy romance, youth, love, story. (maybe mystery too because super weird what they did in the movie and it doesn't explain it at all.)

                I have seen this movie some 15 times now, and I feel like it is finally time to write my review and I want to cover several perspectives, so be patient and read till the end. Spoiler Free.
First of all, I deem this to be the quintessential anime that everyone must watch. It replaced spirited away because it is so much more approachable in every respect. Even if you have never watched anime, don't like anime, this film is absolutely stunning. The art is fantastic, the music and sounds are crisp and of the utmost quality, the characters are thoroughly fleshed out, and the story
                  is unique, touching, and approachable. But this is my opinion. I have watched this movie with a lot of my friends and some really enjoyed it, and some felt it had too many plot holes for their liking.
Second of all, this movie is for enjoyment, and nothing more. Several people really thought too hard about some of the plot points, and that isn't what you need to be doing here. Its very Disney like in the manner that the magical is left alone and doesn't need further explanation. Just go with the flow, which this movie has. Its a proof of concept movie that you can take a solid plot line, throw anything at it, and it will do well. 
The build up to the ""problem"" is solid, enjoyable, humorous, and really tricks you into thinking that it will be happy all the way through. Once said ""problem"" arises, the characters seek a solution, solve the said problem through a ""magical"" method (that is explained through out but if you are too dense you will miss it), and then it seems to leave you on a cliff hanger, and then finishes with a great climax. It really is just a well executed story that should be taken as is, as a pleasant experience, and I think that the people who try to look to close at it are the ones who enjoy it less. Let your soul indulge in a little bit of magic.
The only movies that come this close are makoto shinkai's other works, all of witch have his signature style of dropping little hints through out the flim and then connecting the dots at the very end. He is truly a master of his craft.",10,Singular9

                Truly a magical anime to watch. The best anime movie of this time. The plot is great but not perfect. I still not understand some of the moments because of many plotholes. The movie must ran longer to clear the plotholes. The romance is great like Golden Time and Hotarubi no Mori e vibe combined. The drama is top-notched.
Pro:
- Great story and music
- Memorable in my life
- Charcter development which is awesome
Con:
- Many plotholes
- It does not explain why the phenomenon (you better watch) of the 2 characters

                Ill try to touch on stuff that other reviews don't so reading this is worthwhile. When I first rated this movie, I gave it a 7. Shinkai provides a lot of tiny details which highlight the bigger picture and the idea of fate such as the trains going in different paths and the braided cord on the wrist of taki. This movie has sooo much to appreciate in terms of its stellar animation, detailed art, and awesome soundtrack. I felt that I was truly in the bustling streets of tokyo, or the breathtaking overhead view of itomori. It's clear that this movie was made to
                  stand out among other movies and be a movie of the likes of which we have never seen before, in which I can safely say they delivered, both positively and negatively. Going back to rating the movie, I could give this movie a 6 or 7 just as easily as I could give it a 9 or 10. It has some fatal flaws and killer strengths. I am not sure if I can call it a masterpiece but it has to be a classic movie. With that being said, at the time of this review(sunday august 21st, 2022), kimi no na wa or your name has an 8.86 rating on my anime list and is by far, the most popular anime movie, but I must say, it MUST be a little overrated, you are lying to yourself if you say otherwise. Onto the negatives. Again I won't touch on this too heavily but boy are the plotholes crazy in this movie, there are random sci-fi ideologies that do insanely random stuff with a NUMBER of different climaxes. In the second half of the movie after a specific turning point, the plot becomes IMPOSSSIBLE to follow, their attempt to overwhelm you with the limited time of around 1 hr 30-35 min backfires heavily here. You simply cannot understand what is going on unless you paused the movie and looked back and/or did some research. It feels as if the supernatural and absurd things are made up on a literal whim just for the convenience of the plot and viewer. Although I had a small idea of what was going on, having to keep a mental timeline throughout the entire movie required far too much brainpower because there is a level of work you have to do yourself. As the movie draws to an end, the inconsistencies in the plot are evident and the only thing that is clear is that fate is what draws them to each other. How they remember things are unclear, how they forget things are unclear, why they forget is unclear, why they remember is unclear, what makes them remember is unclear, what makes them forget is unclear, the extent to which they remember and forget and what enables them to remember is unclear. Sorry for the rant but you have to turn your brain off and just watch the movie with an intent to enjoy. The saving grace of this movie is the ending, it is vague with the intent to leave it up for interpretation which is what led me to give it an 8/10. I really hate vague endings and it keeps stuff on my mind for a while which really made me annoyed at the end of the movie of how confusing everything is. But after doing some research on the movie, it makes me feel as the attempt to overwhelm was intentional and the varying, conflicting events of the movie were intentional because the ending can be interpreted in different ways, dont wanna spoil it but the ending is actually quite perfect, after researching, there are hundreds of theories on what happens after the ending all of which cite different events from the story. Maybe im just giving too much credit to shinkai but if this is true, it surely is a genius move. There are hundreds of details in this movie with many breathtaking, climactic moments, and even small 1-second details which come back later influencing how you interpret the movie. Shinkai knows this and while there hundreds of ways the story could pan out, and why certain things happen the way they do, there is one thing that we can take away for sure from this movie. You know your fate when you see it, the reason why isn't always clear but there is a moment in time when you realize what your fate and destiny truly is and there could be many reasons for it but it doesn't ultimately matter. Love does not always need a reason, to feel complete is as good a reason as any to love. They knew it when they saw it and they chased it, and all they needed was a name, tiny details to the end. I tried not to spoil anything and if you read all that, you have my deepest thanks. Please add or dm me with any questions or if you want to talk, hopefully someone reads this as I put a lot of time and effort into this review. thanks im out — nashy",8,nashyyyyyyy

                What I liked most about this movie was the attention to detail placed on the mindset of the audience. When I watch movies I tend to put myself in the director’s shoes and ask myself what’s this scene trying to show? How do I want my audience to feel? And for the first time ever it felt like our minds were in sync throughout the entire movie. There were plenty of times where a scene left me with questions only for the following scene to answer them but not in a direct way, it was the subtly of the answers that made it so great
                  eg. The way a person styled their hair or the ring on a person’s finger when they waved. 
I also liked how this movie handled the process of remembering forgotten memories. It’s not always as simple as having someone trigger a memory, it’s a lot more nuanced than that and this movie handled that element brilliantly. When I watched this movie a second time, scenes that I originally passed off as filler had purpose to the character’s remembering things later on. Every scene was well thought out and neatly intertwined which made their thought processes believable. 
This leads me to my only criticism. At the first time of watching some scenes felt too short or skipped over and that confused me initially. However, upon second viewing I could see that those scenes would have either revealed the story too early or had no effect on the final event.  This does affect character development slightly, as the movie is forced to drive the story forwards with only brief stops in time to spend on the characters themselves.
Overall, I think this was a necessary step to aid the telling of the story. I can’t say why without spoiling the movie but I hope you will agree after watching a second time. Really pay attention to the purpose of each scene and how the early scenes tie into the characters decisions towards the end.",10,Magic_user

                Kimi no Nawa, is as most know one of the most praised anime movies, but, is it really that good? The plot is really simple at the start a boy and a girls swapping bodies for aparently no reason. A bit later the plot starts to mess with timelines.
I may had miss something but I never was conviced of what was happening, even if its fiction I expect the story to justify its own elements somehow and that never happened in this case. It just happened and thats it.

                  good one.",5,hugo3655

                At the time of this review, this movie is at the top spot at MAL rankings sitting at a comfortable 9.4/10. This film has been named a masterpiece again and again, and I, for once, am not the one to disagree.
I won't go to full detail as to why the film entertains me so much, I'm sure I share my opinion with the majority of the audience. So if you want an in-depth analysis of all the outstanding parts of the movie(animation, sound, setting, etc), check other reviews.
What I do want to mention, are the values and lessons in this movie, and how it has
                  stirred my mind like no other movie has.
Now I am a keen student in sciences. I strive to discover the unknown, and I need proof to be convinced of something. So my mind is quite skeptical and always try to critic something.
I also live like the majority of the human population, living through a daily routine that guides us, that keeps us on track in life. And the movie addresses this in such a breathtaking fashion that I had to think twice about it(and I rarely do).
In the movie, both characters are just random human beings, in random places and with no connection with each other whatsoever. Had the events in the movie not happen, they will most likely never meet.
But the way the movie does the switcharound is just phenomenal. Although they switched places, the rest of the world kept moving on oblivious to it. And I think this is something we often ignore but is very significant in our world. The world is so vast that we get drowned in it, but the movie teaches us to break free sometimes, and do unorthodox things, to keep ourselves fresh.
Another aspect that struck my heart was the human memory.
(slight spoiler but not really cause it's kinda obvious after a certain point?)
Throughout the movie, we kept getting reminded how fickle the human's capability of keeping memories are(I'd argue that this is the main driver of the movie, and causes more twists along the way) The characters have a sense of longing, sense of emptiness, in their lives. They keep living their lives thinking about the blurry events, but never really remembering it.
This strikes too close to real life. We forget dreams soon after waking up. If we sleep for 1/3 of our lives, how much are we missing on? 
Lastly, the supernatural part of the romance. This story is set in our world, where science is accepted worldwide as the leading solution to questions. Yet something as romantic as soul-swapping occurs in the film.
Yes, I know, it's a fictional movie, no way something like that'd happen in real life yadayadayada... I disagree. Partially, at least. 
As I've mentioned, I'm a firm believer that proof > belief. But thinking twice about it, we live in a world where mysteries still roam. Some legends still lay unanswered and many people still tend to lean towards belief rather than proof in times of need(which is why major religions are still prevalent in modern history). But the idea of something like this happening? It's too romantic to completely ignore.
(TLDR)
I want to believe that our world is still full of supernatural occurrences, a world where swapping lives is possible, a world where seeing ghosts of the past under kataware-doki is possible, a world where half of a person's soul is in their kuchikamisake. I don't believe in that, but I really do want to.
But I'm sure this world exists in the mind of some people, who aren't driven by technological and scientific progress of the modern world, and still live traditionally, peacefully, and happily.

I just watched it and it was really mind blowing, the art and emotion vanishes the few flaws
art 10:
For me the best part of the film is the art, it's incredibly well and emotional. Some scenes made me nearly cry because of their beautifulness. It's also quite clean and there aren't unnessecary parts.
story 7:
On the other hand, the story is quite telegraphed and we can see easily where the plot leads throughout the watching. But there is a major twist that makes the story better than it was supposed to be. The use of different timelines is sometimes a genius idea and sometimes confusing. The general idea is quite original though (the concept of mind swaping is a bit mysterious also).
character 6:
It's maybe the major flaw. There isn't a lot of developed characters but the few are really human-like: Mithsua's sister and grandmother for example and also Okudera are really good. 
Mithsua is also really good and human but there is still too little character development. She's the perfect clichee of the character living in a small village, having high responsibilities and old traditional family but wanting to go to huge cities with more ""life"".
Taki isn't a good character on the other side. We know almost nothing about him and his motivations. He's even too dull sometimes. The fact that he becomes more and more important throughout the story and also the fact that the story is more focused on Mitsuha and her village despite Taki's lack of character devlopement is sometimes disturbing.

With the soft, but powerful tones conveyed by the movie, I was astounded to feel so much emotion once the movie was completed. The movie starts off very well, capturing my attention within the first few seconds. I was absorbed throughout the entirety of the film, desperate to see what would happen next and how the next scene would play out. In all honesty once I reached the end, I wasn't overly hyped, or disappointed, but was truly satisfied with the way things ended. I'm glad I came upon this movie.

After watching it, I felt like I was waking up from my dream, when I went down.
The background of that scene was good, or the speed feeling over there was the best.
But, I strongly remember that memory, ""as if I remember"", as if it was the same as when I woke up from an interesting dream.
But, the memory of people is ambiguous, even if you think to keep all the good scenes, the details will gradually be lost.
Eventually the memories of dreams will replace ""I saw fun dreams"" and I will forget seeing my dreams.

This came out 4 years ago, but very few movies now come even close to comparing to this one. I am confused as to why there are two pubs next to each other and neither of them went out of business. The premise of swapping bodies with someone and wanting to meet each other is a common trope,
                  but they pulled it off very well.
This was visually stunning. The detail, the colour contrast, the way all of the individual characters, even minor, looked so unique, etc. This is a film that I believe anyone who has worked in digital media or has any other artistic backgrounds would fall in love with and pick up on all the intricate details, meaning those who don't will also find themselves fascinated.
The sound design was very interesting. All of the songs felt like they just fit into place and helped make this movie the masterpiece that it was. The opening sequence has a song that, even if you don't know, you'll be bobbing your head to throughout, whilst being enthralled by the beautiful 4K animation.

                The description doesn't do this movie justice!!!! To be honest I watched it thinking it was something else, but I couldn't be more happy with making a mistake like that!!! This movie was so beautiful and tugged on my heart strings but in such a good way. The art was beautiful as was the soundtrack, and the plot had me engrossed. 
It started out a bit slow and I found myself eagerly, and not so patiently, waiting for more things to happen. But it didn't take too long before I was watching the time left on the video to make sure it wasn't ending soon-
                  even when it was over I didn't want it to end!!
A plot that involves people switching bodies with each other isn't really something that I'd normally watch, but like I said before I went into this thinking it was something else. I'm really really glad that happened, because the way they incorporated the body switching wasn't annoying or aggravating in the least- the plot was continuously intriguing and kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved all the characters too. I don't think there's much else I can say without including spoilers, but I hope this was enough to convince anyone who was on the fence about it to give it a shot!!",10,ellainc

                Kimi no nawa follows the lives of a teenager Mitsuha, a girl living in a rural Japanese village and Taki, a boy from the busy city of Tokyo. The movie opens with Mitsuha being told by her friends that she has not been herself lately. When Mitsuha wishes that she could be rid of the old traditions linked to her family history, she awakens in the body of Taki and believing it to be a weird dream, carries out fulfilling her wishes. What she soon discovers is that she and Taki are able involuntarily switch bodies through their sleep due to some strange cosmic event.
                  This seemingly fun ability takes a serious twist when they uncover the many lives at stake that can be saved with the bond that connects them through time and space. 
The art style of this movie was phenomenal. Showcasing the various mystical nature backdrops and glittering city life, the art truly had no faults. The character art was also something which had a nice natural feel. The musical interludes were very fitting for the movie, though I grew a bit tiresome of just how many times they appeared, feeling sated with the first and wishing it was the last. 
Though the plot of this movie was very enjoyable and unique, reminding me of the movie ‘In Your Eyes,’ the timelines and amnesia of the characters was a bit confusing and I would have preferred there to be more time spent with the main characters together. The reason I say this is because this story has romance weaved through it and though it feels appropriate, it would have been even more believable if we got more glimpses of how their personalities connect to balance out their strong desire to find each other. Their connection is what the whole heroic feel of the movie plot rests on. In saying that, my favorite part of this movie included the first half in which the mischief that Taki and Mitsuha got into whilst being in each others body and the cool ways in which they communicated with each other was explored. My favorite scene included the one in which Taki drank the magical sake and all the trippy time travel magic happened. The supporting characters in this one are also very charming and likeable since they deal with all the craziness and believe their best buddies, even without any proof.
Questions that I am left with include: How come Mitsuha’s dad didn’t have a stronger reaction to realizing that Taki was in her daughter’s body? Also, what was the event that sparked Mitsuha’s connection with Taki anyway? Though she has a history of this sort of stuff happening in her family, why was the connection with Taki rather than any other human?
Loved the cute and playful parts of this feature, but sometimes the movie just felt just too random and coincidental. The bittersweet ending also didn’t win me over completely because I was hoping for the fluffy vibe to be reintroduced in the later half of the movie. All in all…I liked it and would watch again for the undeniable magical feel of this movie that grabs you from the beginning and does not let you go.",7,Moonywanderer

The premise of the story is very interesting, and the pacing does a good job in making you never feel bored, yet still keep things hidden and enticing until the very end. 
The art and sound are one of the most beautiful I've ever seen, together improving the experience by an insane degree.
Although I can see people being touched by this anime, I personally couldn't find myself being hit too hard by 'the feels'. This does not mean I couldn't relate to

Kimi no Na wa (Your Name) was a phenomenal film! This film had such a great story line that connected two characters that have fantastic background stories to accompany them. This music that was written for this film just helps the story feel more connected and I was not disappointed when I first watched the film! The story between Mitsuha and Taki is just beautifully written and the complexity of the film is out of this world. 
I personally love this anime film because I haven't seen a story like this before..",10,smolkirby22

                ""Your Name"" - is a masterpiece. Now you can just go and watch it. 
First of all - picture. From the first seconds and up to the end of the movie your eyes will thank you. Is it be a small town near the extinct volcano or subway train in Tokio or fantasy dream of one of the heroes, you can just stop the movie and look at the picture just like in art gallery. And landscapes are really cool, I don't know is it really so beautiful in Japan or artists slightly improve it, I do not care, it is pleasure for watching. 
Second
                  - story. I need to say, that after this kind of stories, mostly I must drink some wine or other alcohol. And at all my emotions are easy to manipulate, and because of it, I will try not to write an emotional post about how perfect movie is. Still, if you like stories of ""Bioshock:Infinite"", ""LifeisStrange"", ""Mr.Nobody"" or ""Stardust"", you will love this story too. Emotionally, sincerely, mysteriously, keep in suspense, break your heart, give you hope, steal it from you and then give it back again.
This is the story about two teenagers: Mitsuha Miyamizu - schoolgirl, who lives in a countryside and do not love it very much, and Taki Tachibana - schoolboy, who lives in Tokio. And one day they switch their bodies, just like in not really fun hollywood's comedies.  But it all not so simple, because ... oh, it's spoilers. Yes, the story had really hard spoilers so be aware. I do not predict all story turns and it was good. I will just say, that this is a movie about love and how fates of people concatenate in time and space. Somewhat mystical, but we all love fairytales.
You will worry about heroes because it isn't just love at stake, it ... spoilers again. And probably, one can't say ""love"" in this case, it some feeling that must be defined by many words.

                Kimi no Na wa was so tear jerking and meaningful to me as a film. I really enjoyed the characters personalities and their interactions with each other. There was some comic relief and some really deep meaning in the film. I really like how the film deals with time and the it's analogy with a comet splitting, as if its two people that were intertwined as one. The animation is one of the most beautiful pieces of art iv'e ever seen. The musical soundtrack was just the most amazing thing my ears have ever listened to and it paired so excellently with the movie, hitting
                  me in really emotional parts. All together you'll fall in love with this beautiful film, its a masterpiece and deserves to shine on it's own.",10,akichantheneko

                There are few animated movies in my opinion that can make you fully connect emotionally with characters and the story in an hour and 40 minutes but this is one!
The only con I would say is the plot can be hard to follow bc of the multiple time jumps and the idea of time travel. 
But the character development is amazing, especially for a movie. I would say that this is a true coming of age movie with just the right amount of comedy to keep things light but also dramatic enough that you keep watching. I cannot explain how intricate the plot is but
                  isn't EXTREMELY difficult to understand if you pay attention. 
The other characters have good screen time without interfering with the main plot which I really liked. Plus there was a simple unraveling of romantic feelings which was nice and thoroughly well done.
The idea of fate and that ""red string of fate"" in Japanese fiction is very popular and a popular story to tell - how two characters are connected somehow in an intricate way. I would say though that this is by far one of my top three movies that has done it right. 
The ending did me dirty and the soundtrack is absolute gold as well. It was just done so nicely and left me crying sad and happy tears.",10,classically-kat

is a good movie that is highly appreciated by fans and critics worldwide. One striking factor for that are the pretty visuals and artwork. It´s really insane to see what nowadays technique is capable of. So even if you dislike the story you´ll get at least some eye candy. This brings me to my next point which is the story. 
The first half is more on the funnier side before the movie carries you along and tries to hit you emotionally. Added to that are the great OST and some nice and well placed songs.
This
                  package works for some while it doesn´t for everybody. 
The author achieved his goal to create a story that is accessible for everyone, yet deep enough that you can´t really grasp what´s going on at first sight. However many people claim that the plot is filled with holes and is illogical. And I have to aggree. Not everything is well executed and even if you give the plot a lot of thought, there are some things that don´t sum up. 
We have to accept that it´s only a movie and the story is made up in the head of one genius. We can´t expect everything to be perfect. We are no robots. At the end of the day I would advise the viewer rather to enjoy the movie instead of trying to dissect frame by frame over analyzing everything. 
For me personally I think a big weak point were the characters. They just don´t shine with personality and authentic emotions. This movie will remain in our heads for its glorious artwork, for the tricky plot, but surely not for its characters. Their faces and names will be forgotten.
However I think the harsh critique of some people is kind of undeserved. It is with no doubt a great movie to watch and highly enjoyable. Easy to understand yet highly demanding and thought-provoking.

                An absolute masterpiece in my opinion! I mean, it's ""Kimi no Na wa"" and every anime fan should have heard of this movie and watched it, so there's not much for me to say, but this was actually one of the few anime (I'll throw anime and anime movies into one pot for this review) where I actually cried in the end. It's so beautiful, not the visual style (Which is of course great, but not outstanding) but the story, which is told with so much love and care, I was absolutely amazed watching this movie.
I can't even describe the feelings I had, all I
                  can tell you, is, that if you haven't watched it, do it, right now, leave everything else, watch it! You'll enjoy it, I can guarantee that!",10,ChibiOnion

                I rewatched Kimi no Na wa for the fourth time today. And I swear, it never gets old. This movie is just really a masterpiece and I can't emphasize that enough.
The animation and music are beautiful. The way Taki and Mitsuha fell in love was so beautiful. Some scenes in particular are just so heartwrenching: when Mitsuha came to Tokyo, when Taki longed for Mitsuha after her death and after he forgot about her, and of course kataware-doki. I also commend the voice actors and animators for hitting the gender differences so accurately, whether it be the way they talked or their simple behaviors and
                  mannerisms.
My one complaint though is that I find it impossible for them to NOT know the year they were living in; the knowledge is essential for both school and work. Also, after rewatching numerous times, I realized they got the dates wrong: Mitsuha should be in 2016 while Taki should be in 2019, but these were swapped in the backgrounds (if you look closely).
This movie has taught me that sometimes, we take the nuances of love for granted -- the fact that you and your loved one are born in the same time, can meet in the same place, and can even interact to begin with is such a blessing. What would you do if your soulmate were from a different era? A different country? To be separated by both time and distance is something rather difficult to contemplate on, but the movie does this masterfully.",10,kate_sun

                Kimi No Nawa is directed by Makoto Shinkai a story about a country girl and city boy who struggles through adversity and somehow spiritually connected to each other. The animation start with 2 different characters portraying their own lives together they bond and experience a spiritual events that gives impact to their lives. So to rate about this movie I would give my personal approval because they show amazing animation movie I have watched throughout my 10 years of watching anime's. As a  animation enthusiast on watching animation films if I were to compare this to Zootopia,Big hero 6, Frozen, and etc. I'm pretty
                  sure this anime is completely compelling in my perspective you can watch it all over again. I'm not saying that I'm fanboy of this movie but you might as well try it if u watch this movie it will provide some moral lesson and help you can become a better or mature person. As for animation style it sounds lively and the same time it's melancholy. Their character design synchronizes or blending with the story as well. Therefore i conclude that Kimi No Nawa is a master piece",10,reikaxkira

                Truly a great masterpiece that made me cry and got me obsessed with it. The seer original concept and emotional attachment i saw in the movie really made my experience watching a beautiful one. It truly is an amazing movie but i can definitely understand why people would dislike or find it overrated. The only issue i had with the movie was the imbalance of screentime and background knowledge between taki and mitsuha. After reading the book, i realized taki occupied about 60-65% of the story(including taki in mitsuha's body). I know taki received a lot of screentime because he was looking for mitsuha, but
                  even with this very little was known about his backstory. However, despite this tiny flaw i had, I will not hesitate to say that this deserves its spot for being ""The best anime film"" ever. Overrated and over hyped? Maybe, but it got to the top for a reason. This movie truly delivers <3",10,xue_han

                Kimi no Na wa. (Your Name) is something that I can't really describe, but made me think about it a lot. It made me cry, smile, laugh. Every sense of the movie showed just how beautiful and powerful artistic media can be. It didn't make me believe that anime was saved, but gave me a deeper appreciation for the media.
The sound direction and artwork in this movie gives so much vibes. I usually don't mention the animation and sound while watching an anime, but the beautiful direction that was given made it hard for me to not notice. Without giving away too much about it's
                  plot and characters, I would like to say that Shinkai's use of motifs of lines and time was absolutely genius. The way these two motifs work together create thought-provoking and beautiful moments.
With all these points and no step out of line, why did I give it a 9? To me, this made me feel as art and media can do so much more. Art has no boundaries, and this movie proves so. People have the power to create something powerful.

Without providing spoilers, the film will make you think you know what's about to happen and then all of sudden it'll move in an even more interesting direction.

                I'd seen the posters for Kimi no Na wa which looked so bright and colourful but i hadn't realised it was from Shinkai until i decided to go see it.
Familiar with some of his earlier work i wasn't sure what to think going in, i felt 5 Centimeters per Second, while visually amazing, was slow and at times boring and Voices of a Distant Star was too short and empty, so i was a little worried about Kimi no Na wa.
I was blown away!
From the soundtrack to the visuals the attention to setting the scene and mood of the movie is obvious, this is someone
                  who has the movie already playing in his mind before it's even on paper.
The movie starts with a Tokyo city boy Taki and a remote village girl Mitsuha who discover they are both dreaming of being someone else.
As the movie progresses we see that they are dreaming of each other, and while dreaming they actually switch bodies.
Classical body-switch humor ensues where both have to come to terms with what's happening and deal with being in someone else's body.
Kimi no Na wa then adds it's own twist for these star-crossed teenagers and starts to ramp up from a very casual and warming pace to a sprint as things completely change!
Shinkai works magic to drag you into a story so completely with the warming characters, haunting musical scores and incredible artwork that you truly feel pained for them as you go from wondering if they will fall in love and will they ever meet to wondering if they ever could meet.
The movie is a rollercoaster of emotions bundled so close together than once the story really begins there's no letting up.

Disney the anime! Oh wait, Kimi no nawa!Now hold on, put those pitchforks away.

The art style was amazing! It delivers the right kind of atmosphere and feeling it was trying to portray, a very cheery atmosphere.
Kimi no nawa doesn't deserve to be the top #1 anime, heck i think Gintama should be no.1, but hey, i guess in my perspective as a serious reviewer (Pffft!) it has a very strong reason why it is in the position it is today, the target audience, It can be viewed by children (except for that fondle part, just a heads up for you parents out there), but at the same time teens could also enjoy it and that also means that adults can find satisfaction in the movie too.

                The movie is mediocre, I can appreciate the animation and the art direction, and we can also say that the way the story rolls is pretty interesting, the characters meet each other by switching body's and living the life of each other... but how exactly am I suppose to believe that something like that can evolve into a romantic connection? They had been doing that to endure the situation they're involve in, there is not a plausible way to think that such a thing can happen in those circumstances, you can feel worried about your survival partner, but you can't feel the desire to be
                  her/his boyfriend/girlfriend, at least not when you are unable to treat with that person face to face.
The time travel is another plot hole, both kids were set on different dates and none of them were able to figure that out (despite they spent like 1 or 2 weeks dealing with the problem)

                This is going to be a short review, but it's what I consider my opinion on Kimi no Na wa or Your Name. To start off, it was great. One of the greatest achievements by Makoto Shinkai for sure. 
Art: 10 - Beautiful, One of the Best in 2016 and still holds up now in 2018.
Sound: 10 - Beautiful music throughout, helped to encapsulate the emotions from each scene.
Enjoyment: 10 - Loved it
Now, let me get critical on this film. I gave it a 7, which means it was undoubtly good. Remember, I'm not saying it's bad, but I'm also not saying it's a Masterpiece.
                  In my opinion, it had an enjoyabe story. It kept you at the edge of your seat, and in the end. I applaud it for it's abillity to carry this film with the incredible art and music. But it's not without it's faults. Some of the supernatural aspects were used well, but they sort of weren't explained cleary enough. However, even with this lack of understanding, the film was able to potray the supernatural elements in a way that it just works. 
Character: 6 - Don't get me wrong, I love the dynamic of the characters. They have undoubtable chemistry, and it's a big part of the film. Now, why did I give it a 6, which means I thought the characters were fairly done well. The romance felt natural, but also forced in a way. I mean I understand they learned more about each other for a long time, but does this result in romance. I find it cute, and I'm happy for the ending. But it seems Makoto Shinaki added the romance in for the sake of it. Not protesting though.
Overall: 7 - I enjoyed this film, and recommend it to the people who enjoyed Makoto Shinkai's previous works, and people who are looking for a new film or anime to watch.",7,dimlion7

                Makoto Shinkai's YOUR NAME achieved what would arguably be a most improbable feat: it dethroned Hayao Miyazaki's SPIRITED AWAY to become Japan’s most successful film. And what a movie it is! Heartfelt, hilarious, moving, thrilling, and enthralling, this movie cleverly mixes together the central idea from Disney's FREAKY FRIDAY with a bit of BACK TO THE FUTURE for good measure.
It's about two teens -- Taki and Mitsuha -- who somehow find themselves switching places in their bodies periodically. (A running gag involves Taki waking up in Mitsuha's place noticing ""his"" breasts.) Stakes get higher in the latter half when the two star-crossed strangers use that
                  connection to avert a tragedy. Sounds like a bizarre story for an animated film, doesn’t it? But it works. The first half in particular, where we see the difficulties that Taki and Mitsuha experience during their supernatural ""body swapping"" episodes, is hysterically funny. It's only in the second half when things get a little slower, but even then, Shinkai manages to maintain a lot of interest for the viewers, notably in the form of a stylized ""time travel"" sequence and of course the chemistry between the leads.
The dubbing is very well done as well, as per usual by NYAV Post. Both Mike Sinterniklaas and Stephanie Sheh voice the lead characters (and apparently directed each other as well), and turn in great performances. The show stealer, though, is young Catie Harvey as Mitsuha's little sister Yotsuha, who arguably gets the best lines in the film: ""I see you're not touching your b**bies today,"" she snarks at her sister.
YOUR NAME is more of a story for teenagers and adults, but kids might enjoy watching it, too, for aside from the occasional sexual innuendo (which is mostly played for laughs and frankly, is tame compared to what you would see in raunchier Anime), there's little else to offend.",10,JTurner

                A very good movie, but hey lets not get carried away guys. Surely for a movie wether its an anime or not, needs to have something really special in order to get a top notch grade. Kimi no Na wa is surely a beautiful movie with outstanding graphics and nice touching music, but other than that it felt like a relatively normal movie to me. The story is okay, not to difficult and at the same time it makes you think about how it all is knit together. There could have been more to the story, like deeper character development or a smarter twist to
                  the meteor tale, but all in all its okay. Then we have the characters that are over medium good, with more depth than the average anime character I've seen, but theyre not on the pair of excellent characters such as Griffith from Berserk, or Light from Death Note, for instance. The enjoyment I get from this movie is still really good, not excellent, but good. I'd say the movie could have brought me tears of happiness or tears of sadness, if they had made it even better in the story and character department. As the ending unfolded, I was abit moved yes, but not more than the overall rating for the film gets an 8/10. Conclusion: A very good movie, though a bit overrated on MAL. Don't expect a masterpiece of sadness like Clannad After Story, expect a beautiful movie, with some nice music and a decent story.",8,Are_Skodvin

   I must admit that I saw this work twice, because at first I did not give it the due importance it deserved, and when I reassembled the work, I realized how magnificent it was, and made that revision even so late.
      One of the highlights of this work is the captivating story, which even with some clichés, instigates you to watch more and more to the point of not even seeing the time pass. It has a beautiful beginning, a wonderful ending, and an exciting touch in the middle. A simple but well executed story.     But the story is not the strong point of the work, but its animation, with incredible scenarios that deserve admiration, in addition to fluid movement and design of well-made characters, every detail, every trace, every scene was made with maximum effort. One of the most beautiful animations I've ever seen, worthy of applause.
In addition, the game is accompanied by a soundtrack of respect, an exciting opening and a closing that takes a tear out of your eyes as well as background music that fits perfectly with the excitement that the scenes go through.
 The only weaknesses of the work are the secondary characters, who are not very captivating, or even uninteresting, but who do not disturb their experience.
        With a simple but well executed story, an animation that other studios envy and a soundtrack of respect, kimi no na wa can be recommendable to anyone. Even if you do not like that job, you certainly deserve respect.",9,KermitHatake

                I loved this movie. This was one fantastic movie where two people connect from a body switch scenario which to me it seems very exciting. It makes the overall plot interesting and creates a bond between the characters and how they feel towards one another. I personally recommend this to people who struggle with long distance relationships. It may show a sense of hope and help you deal with it more successfully. 
   This was a masterpiece to me. It had a wonderful story with a bit of classic and very plausible outcomes from certain situations but overall it made me feel hope.
                  This movie was very enjoyable and I loved it so much. There could have been slight improvement in the story making it have a less obvious outcome but it still was very outstanding.",10,Kiyasu21

                Shinkai's 2016 film Your Name stands to many as his magnum opus, but in 2021 does it hold up? Well i'd argue it was never a good movie story wise. Aside from the breathtaking visuals this film lacks the characters and execution to make a good romance film. This film starts off poorly as it takes a while to even get into the main course. The first 30 minutes seemingly feel dragged on and boring. Furthermore, the characters also hardly have any distinct personality or good traits... especially Taki.... He is primarily just a cardboard cutout meant for you to self insert and its gross.
                  Mitsuha is less dull as she has a little more character throughout the film but it doesn't really matter because the backstory and character seems to amount to nothing. This films gimmick also doesn't seem to work due to the fact that the characters don't interact and are merely attracted to each other based on their lifestyle. This also makes for very dull and uninteresting sequences throughout the film as they seemingly carry no weight and merely drag on and drag. This film also feels rushed in some places and it's hard to tell what's going on sometimes. All through those negatives though there are some good things. For example. The great animation. That's kind of it.
Now the ending of this seems kinda.... why? I don't see what pulled at everyone's heartstrings... It's left open and feels unrewarding especially for the bad characters and drag of a story it was. At least give us a clear ending that doesn't leave fans and many others guessing.

                One word, overrated. When I first started to watch this movie, I was really interested in what they could do with such a fun plot device, but as the movie dragged out longer and longer I started to realise a major problem with the film. Our characters have no depth to them. You could sum up the entire movie into a single sentence. 
ALTHOUGH! I did think that the soundtrack was beautiful and really got through to me, same goes with the art style. (especially the scene with the shooting stars).
The story is a bit off as well, I found myself questioning a lot of
                  the plot points and really disliking the direction the movie was heading. The worst thing about the movie though has to be the ending, I will not spoil it, but if you watch this movie. Don't expect some sort of great conclusion like I did, because you will only have disappointment at the end.
Overall I will give it a 7 as the Art style and sound design save this movie from being a 5 or a 6.",7,DrTelstra

                Story: 10
This is one of the most original stories ever produced. When you view the trailers for this movie, you might think that it's an ordinary, wacky, body-switching film. I've seen enough Hollywood movies with the same trope, but this movie takes it to a whole different level. Emotionally, it's like a Jenga game. It starts of ordinarily, then extra-ordinarily. It builds, and builds, giving you different kinds of emotion as the story progresses, until you reach the ""What the hell?!!"" scenes, then you start scratching your head while still feeling the emotions built upon as you reach the cusp of a more raw feeling.
                  Then your brain starts to kick in and try to figure it out along with the characters. If I were to describe this film in terms of Hollywood movies, it's a combination of ""The Lake house"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Source Code"" (without the violence) or ""The Butterfly Effect"" (but better). 
Art: 10
The Art is fantastic. When Hayao Miyazaki retired, I thought I'd seen the last of the most beautiful Anime sceneries and characters, but this film proved me wrong. It made me so happy to see such lush, wonderful artwork. The combination of hand-drawn cell animation and 3D renderings gives this movie a depth that you can only find in a Studio Ghibli film. The characters were drawn in such a more realistic way, that you can be taken out of the film in the context that it is an anime. I often find so much humanity in the facial expressions that the characters show.
Sound: 9
RADWIMPS provided such wonderful, contemporary J-Pop soundtrack, that you immediately feel the tone for the movie. It's frenetic, and full of emotions, hitting just the right chord (no pun intended). I have a strong appreciation for J-Pop, as it relates to anime, and the music in this movie, gives an automatic identity and character to the anime. It identifies itself to the movie the same way that ""Tank!"" by the Seatbelts is so readily associated with Cowboy Bebop, or ""Sobakasu"" by Judy and Mary for Rurouni Kenshin's first season.
Character: 10
The characters were lovely. Taki and Mitsuha were depicted so naturally. If I were a teenaged boy in that same situation, I would've done the same thing. They were embarrassed during awkward situations and you can see it in their faces as well as the tone and timbre in the voices of the voice actors. I watched the Japanese dub and the way that the voice performances were delivered were superb. Both the main leads were extremely likable. You automatically empathize with the situation that they find themselves in. And when they discover the things that they discover, their reactions were so genuine and heart-breaking that you'll get carried away. The supporting characters were there for plot advancement, but they nonetheless likable. I really enjoy films and animes wherein there are no annoying characters. A villain can be a villain without them being annoying, and luckily, there are no annoying characters, nor villains in this anime film.
Enjoyment: 10
Enjoyment is guaranteed when you watch this film. The plot and twist alone will make any anime fan or even a sci-fi fan happy. The heart-warming scenes between the main leads will also provide romance fans a little bit of entertainment. And the last lines that the characters said as the scene panned, it gave me goosebumps.
Overall: 10
If it wasn't evident, I really enjoyed this film and will readily recommend this to any movie lover. If you're as conscientious as I am regarding the story thread and causality of events, you will enjoy this film even more. It's not just an enjoyable and highly well-produced anime, it's an extremely well-produced movie, period. Re-watch value is high since this is not an extremely heavy story that will drain you emotionally. Further screenings will actually give you more clues and tidbits that you did not notice before.
Comparing this movie to a Studio Ghibli film is a disservice to the animators and the director, as they stamp their own identity in the story. A fantastic combination of humor, drama and romance, the pay-off at the end will probably leave you with a lump in your throat or tears in your eyes.

                Rarely does an animated movie capture the viewer in the way Kimi No Na Wa does so elegantly. Just forty minutes in, I realised I was already deeply invested in the main characters. For the second half of the movie I was nothing short of on the edge of my seat and could only watch as the story played out. 
Your Name begins with a meteor splitting, visible and witnessed by many across Japan. In particular two teens living completely different lives on opposite sides of the country. Mitsuha lives with her grandma and younger sister in a wonderfully scenic but isolated town. While Taki
                  resides in the fast paced city of Tokyo. The two are thrown into a unique situation when they switch places at random, awaking to find themselves in the other's body for a day, before returning to their own. The journey which follows is dramatic, romantic and tastefully comedic as the two learn to adapt to the sudden changes and their discovery of the bigger picture of why it's happening.
Aside from the captivating plot, the movie is full of artistic beauty and cinematography. With so much detail filling every frame, no scene felt bland. You could pause the movie at any moment and be left with an artwork worthy of it's own frame.
Likewise, the musical composition fits effortlessly and brings the entire movie to a spectacular crescendo. There are a few moments when I felt the vocals of the song were perhaps a little too overpowering, detracting attention from the scene itself.
The movie also has some confusing cuts, where I was left unsure for a time as to what was going on, or which character I was following. Though I imagine on a second viewing, I wouldn't have this issue. 
In summary Your Name tells a captivating story, with unique art and music which ties it neatly together. The main characters have unique personalities and feel very human, while the side characters are developed and integral to the story. If you're the type who is sensitive to romantic tales, bring the tissues.",9,Camsy

                Ok so im gonna be honest with you the first time i saw this movie i thought it was amazing but then i watched it again after i bought it on blu ray and i started to see the flaws But lets start. The animation is excellent and looks great as expected,but i feel that blinded people from how good the movie actually is the story is good but they could do much more with it.the character development is lacking Even for the main characters All you really know is where they came from and what they want you dont get to know any Interesting
                  things about them and you dont know crap about the rest of the characters. I do not like the pacing it starts fairly slow but then after it has introduced everything it goes lightning speed. But something i like is how immersed i was with it, at a point Taki the male protagonist is upset trying to figure things out you also feel this melancholy feeling and it just works. You should watch this movie i feel its almost essential but you dont have to put it on a pedestal like everyone else for me its a 8 although my Mal account says otherwise but im not gonna edit it",8,WOAH_IS_TRASH

***Eine Liebeserklärung an Your Name.***
Als ich zum ersten mal den Film sah, während er erstmals in die deutschen Kinos lief, war ich mit meinen Freunden zusammen gespannt, ob der Film diese Überhäufung an positiver Kritik in den Anime-Medien und den steppenbrandartigen  verbreiteten Hype gerechtfertigt wird. Da ich jedoch ohne Erwartungen den Film schaute, traf mich die geballte Ladung an Bindungen, Atmosphären. Emotionen und Gefühlen die der Film offenbarte und in mir erstmals beim schauen eines Filmes erweckte wurde, wie ein Stich, welcher mir zeigte dass ich noch lebe. Egal wie absurd es klingt, aber ich fühlte auf einmal
                  Emotionen, die ich lange nicht mehr spürte,bzw. die ich niemals in so einer Intensität wahrnahm. Sei es die Atmosphäre und die Umgebung, wie etwa Ittomori und Tokio die mich der Film zum ersten mal mit großen Augen bewundern ließ, die Kamaraperspektiven und Sichtweisen, wie etwa das Fahren in der Straßenbahn, die überfüllten Straßen von Tokio oder die Story von Mitsuha und Taki, die mir, einem eigentlich eher kälteren, zurückhaltenden und bindungscheuen Menschen zeigte, dass Menschen so fühlen können... All das vereinte der Film für mich und machte es mit der unverwechselbraren und immer auf den Punkt genau treffenden Musik von Radwimps zu einem Meisterwerk  und ich kann durchaus Kritik an dem Film, seitens der Anderen nachvollziehen (Kitschig, klischeehaft etc...). Aber ich glaube es gibt manche Dinge - seien es Filme, Spiele, Bücher,Orte,Personen oder die unscheinbarsten Sachen bei denen man das Gefühl hat etwas besonderes für einen gefunden zu haben, ohne den Grund zu kennen. Ein Gefühl das einem zeigt, dass man Mensch ist, fühlen kann und nicht im Meer der Isolation und Anonymität untergeht. Dass man keine Maschine ist, deren einzige Aufgabe Funktionalität und Lebenserhaltung ist, sondern etwas mit Leib und Seele, das Schmerz, Freude und die ganze Farbpalette des Lebens auskosten kann. Und was kann ich sagen... Dieser Film gibt mir dieses Gefühl wieder und wieder, egal wie oft ich ihn schaue. Es ist mir egal, dass man denken könne, ich schwimme auf einer Hype-Welle mit und somit sei der Film nichts besonderes oder gar überhyped. Aber für mich hat der Film einen festen Platz in meinem Herzen gewonnen und ich halte ihn fest, für den Fall an dem ich mich vergewissern will Mensch zu sein und meine Gefühle vollends ausschöpfen möchte.
Schlussendlich kann ich nur sagen: Ich danke ihnen Makoto Shinkai. Auch wenn sie dies wahrscheinlich nie lesen werden, kann ich meine Dankbarkeit kaum in Worte fassen und hoffe dass sie es auch in Zukunft schaffen Emotionen so zu präsentieren, dass Menschen wie ich es einfach nur magisch nennen können. Jetzt merke ich, dass ich es nie hundertprozentig schaffen werde meine Gefühle für diesen Film niederzuschreiben, aber ich will dass dieses Gefühl nie in Vergessenheit gerät und somit ist diese “Review?” oder besser die Liebeserklärung eine Möglichkeit einen Bruchteil davon einzufangen.",10,OnePunchDuman

Kimi no na wa had a really nice plot, something i've never seen before. The first half of the story was Mitsuha and Taki switching bodies and what they did with it. It was a bit enjoying to see them bickering by writing on their faces and other things. It was great then until a tragedy happened that made the story more intense but the problem was that it became more comfusing. For example, like what is the origin of all of this, like why is it happening to both of them. Mitsuha's
                  grandmother kind of explained but it was too dull. They were basically seperated in different times but it ws never answered why and how did it actually happen but so far, the chemistry of both characthers was amazing and it they had such an amazing meeting because it was different than others.",9,KawaiixGhoul

                Your Name is a beautifully executed film about the lives of two teenagers, Mitsuha and Taki. These two individuals live completely opposite lives, with Mitsuha living in a rural, country-side village and Taki living in the bustling city of Tokyo. Given their two very different living situations, Mitsuha lives a more traditional Japanese life, culturally speaking, while Taki lives a more Westernized lifestyle. This can be seen through their bedrooms, their homes, and their hobbies—among other things. Although the two seem worlds away from one another, they somehow become spiritually connected through a supernatural occurrence that will leave their souls intertwined forever. They often switch
                  bodies with one another, and experience life as the other person for certain periods of time. In the end, Mitsuha and Taki, who started off as complete strangers become closely intertwined, and their fate is reliant on one another. This film not only makes commentary on modern-day Japanese issues such as an increasingly older population, a diminishing workforce, and the fear of natural disasters due to Japan’s history of devastating natural disasters, but it does so through strikingly beautiful imagery. This film is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys extremely well-executed visuals and a touching storyline.",10,ridao153

                June 17th, 2019 (based on my 2018/08/31 reaction post, reformatted as a ""MAL review"")
Art/Animation - 7~8/10 (depends if I'm hallucinating)
Sound - 6/10
Characters - 5/10
Story - 6/10
Enjoyment - 5/10
Animation - What do people find beautiful in the animation? Were the movements very detailed? Was it not rather the usual over-filtering that is hailed as ""animation""? Or the simple but smooth design ? (that makes the good animation that easier, by the way)
Every three or five minutes during more than half the movie, I kept being ""punched"" away by a super weird 3D-like arm / hand or legs that were moving weirdly, etc. The worst part being
                  everytime a few walking characters are ""filmed"" above waist : they look like they're still while it's actually the background that slides (like some old and badly made side-scrolling scene).
Often good-looking albeit too computer-painted like backgrounds.
An apparent effort on using less filters (I think?)
Sound - The score is very discrete neither enhancing or diminishing a scene's effect and the SFX are all good. But the use of songs, while fitting for such a large audience teen movie, are at times taking too much place and at others sound inadequate (scenes where a background song doesn't ""seeem right"", can't explain, maybe it's me who's too accustomed to other movies).
Characters - The boy for all the screen time he gets is highly undeserving of this attention while the girl and her environment do some good to the overall movie. Apart from her infatuation, the main female . The hero on the opposite seems empty: while they give him some characeristics (by stating them mainly), I was never under the impression that it was really him. At the very least, his initial teen infatuation was actually ""reasonable"".
Can't remember enough about the rest of the characters.
Story - It was like seeing two stories put back to back, with the 1st one suddenly interrupted and getting its end after the 2nd one. Maybe that was why the movie has achieved a 2hours duration for a teen movie. 
The first story was extremely classical, nothing really special apart the usage of today's technology (but I mostly read/watched those coming-of-age swap stories in the 90s so there might be others that did it since then), so it was easy working. The 2nd one, supposedly the more interesting (and original) element, had great difficulties to not fall into a too high speed, and I felt like it was at time adding more rules ""just because"". Bonus: the two parts felt incoherent between each other too.
Not explaining a fantasy element used to allow a story is perfectly fine, by the way.
Enjoyment - none, because it's just the nth teen romcom I see and I have a strong dislike for most adolescent movies of the 2000+ that lack the charm, colourfulness or fun of 80s ones. I happened to fall asleep during the 2nd half, the 1st time I watched it. I might also be too old.
Score: 5.5+/10

                I’m sorry to say it, but this movie is extremely overrated. People gush on and on about it, when it’s honestly not that good, at least in my eyes. I’ll break it down into categories.
1. Story: 3/10. Not only is the story full of plot holes, but it is confusing and the plot twists are very clearly only there for shock factor. The concept is really interesting, so I’m disappointed it wasn’t carried out as well as it could’ve been
2. Art: 10/10. No one can deny that the animation is gorgeous. The scenery is so beautiful, and nearly every frame is screensaver worthy. I have
                  no complaints here.
3. Sound:10/10. The songs are memorable and catchy. I like them a lot.
4. Character 6/10. The characters are fine. They’re just people. I don’t have much to say except they could’ve been better, but they also could be worse. The romance was unnecessary to the highest degree.
5. Enjoyment: 4/10. Even though 2 of the categories are 10/10s, I don’t weight them as highly as the others. Your Name is beautiful visually and musically, but the story falls flat. I will still listen to the soundtrack s when I’m studying because it’s just that good, but the overall movie is only okay.

          This is the only anime that made my heartbeat up so fast. When i watch the trailer like 2 years ago, my mind was like ""holy shit, this looks good as fuck"", And i was right.
Story :
          The story is very interesting but predictable when i watch it for the first time, but still very good. The pacing is really good. Usually plot twist is unpredictable, but when i watch this, i already know what's gonna happen to this and that. but
                  it's still a suprise for other peoples. The way they end the anime is always making me angry. A very basic love story, but i love it.
Art :

Sound : 
          The voice cast is pretty good. Kamishiraishi Mone only voices 2 characters in her life but already doing a pretty good job. The music is very catchy and match with the theme.
Character: 
          NOW, THIS IS WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE HATE THE ANIME BECAUSE OF THIS.

                ""Kimi no Na wa"", or ""Your Name"", is one of the biggest anime movies of the 2010s. You probably already know what the movie's about so let's just get to the pros and cons.
PROS:
1. The art is beautiful, even for movie standards. This movie has some of the smoothest animation I've ever seen on a screen. The expository shots of Tokyo and Itomori absolutely blew me away. In fact, the only reason I don't give this show a 10 for art is because of how ordinary the people look in comparison to the absolute spectacle of the world they're in. I recognize that this was
                  likely done on purpose to draw attention towards the environment. The people don't even look odd or out of place they're just entirely ordinary, like real people.
2. The soundtrack is immaculate. This movie has multiple anime OP-esque montages and all of them are a delight. And it doesn't end with the songs, the OST itself is almost its own character in the movie. I cannot say more about this OST without delving into spoiler territory so all I'll say is it's one of the best anime soundtracks I've heard.
3. The details of the story are incredibly well written. The attention to detail on character tendencies and consistency are what elevate this movie's story from decent to good as well as what ground the viewer in the world. There's even less that I can say about this section without spoiling the movie so I'll just leave it here.
CONS:
1. The movie doesn't do anything mind-blowing in terms of story. It's not the most heart-wrenching or emotional of stories, at least for me, and it generally plays it pretty safe. There were several moments where I wished the movie would have gone a different direction with a certain plot point, especially with the later portion of the movie.
2. The characters aren't all that interesting. A lot of them are quite static and have very little impact on the story. I found myself asking why certain characters were here in certain scenes and wished that they wrote out the characters a little more. However, the only reason the characters seem a little two dimensional in this movie is because it isn't about the characters. Well if it isn't about the characters, what is it about?
And that's where things get a little interesting. I find that I'm having some difficulty pinning down what the meaning of the movie is exactly. The story of Kimi no Na wa is not one with a definite meaning. Like most good movies, its ending is up to interpretation. It's hard to say exactly how the story ends because so little is said to the viewer in those final moments. I don't mean that there's no talking, characters are talking constantly throughout the ending. I mean that what's being said doesn't serve to guide the viewer to the movie's conclusion, the viewers have to do that themselves. Is the message of the story an explanation of the idea of ""love at first sight""? Is it a psychological story of a character coping with tragedy and loss? Could it all be an elaborate analogy for life-like dreams and premonitions? The beauty of this movie is that all three of those things are completely valid interpretations of the story. 
And while I love that the movie's ending is up to interpretation, it is ultimately subjective and won't be affecting how I rate this movie. Note that the cons section of this review didn't mention any actual problems, that's because there really aren't any. Kimi no Na wa is a great movie done tastefully and with perfect execution, albeit a little safe.
TL;DR it's good go watch it kthxbye",7,WhiteWestlo

                ​Kimi no Na wa was destined to be great. I'm one person who often loses objectivity after a very affecting watch and this was one of them, still I'll try to convey my opinion the best I can.
Firstly, I think Shinkai Makoto pulled off a great one, this wasn't just well made, it was well executed and many, many a people fail at the latter.
Now, coming to the film. It's one that tells of fate, that's what I think. It's one of the a kind, and kind of makes you rethink the ""fact"" that, fate exists.
Amid great direction, small errors go out of emphasis, this
                  has a fairly nice plot and I don't really think I cared it was the way it was. I just wanted to see where it all went. Most films don't manage that. The plot idea was novel, the storyline of fate might have felt a bit different, but it was still so much of a treat that I wouldn't complain.
Art/Sound is impeccable as with every Shinkai Makoto film, he knows how to do it, and proves it yet again. I won't tell you much since my artistic sense only seeks to see if it was aesthetic or not and this clearly was. RADWIMPS has probably done the best rendition and it is almost a perfect fit, jesus. 
Finally, my personal opinion again,
A goddamn beautiful film which everyone should watch, at least that's what I think. Really, watch it, it might just change your views on fate. The gradual romance is something sappy people like me will love (and yes, it's pretty good). As with Shinkai Makoto, it leaves questions because closed endings are just not his thing and although it leaves you yearning, I'm still content.

                This is one of the few things I have seen to actually make me cry which for me, is huge. On the surface its Freaky Friday set in an anime but below that is a really touching and heartwarming story about meeting someone you never knew and trying your damnedest to save someone you have never even met. The score, the cinematography, the characters are all impeccably done with so many of these parts playing off each other and working like a well oiled machine.

The story of the anime is not that complex but with the body switching and some surprises that come later in the movie the story stays interesting but predictable at many times. It's a cute and happy story that kinda keeps you grinning throughout the whole movie or at least i did.Art: The visuals are just absolutely stunning and very smooth animations. Scenery was just amazing and I feel like there is no movie or show that beats their scenery and art.
Sound: The music was very good, nice and simple to where it was placed very well. My only complaint was I wish there was more of a variety of songs rather than the same theme and melody played over in different styles to add different effects.
Character: The main characters are somewhat stereotypical anime high school characters but I have to give props to them for portraying it very well and adding very small details that make the characters not boring.
Enjoyment: The movie was very enjoyable and is a movie that you could take anyone to watch and they would enjoy it.
Overall: I absolutely loved everything in the movie. It may have it flaws but what movie doesn't? I would definitely watch the movie over and over again.",10,Khaiwaii

                Such a good film, paired with an excellent soundtrack that keeps everything subtle in the way it supports the moods of every scene in the movie. Taki is probably my favourite character ✌ or Tsukasa, and it was nice to see both Taki and Mitsuha adapting to each other over the gradual course over the hour-and-a-half. A brilliant storyline, although sometimes things seemed a little too slow-burn, if there's anything to complain about, but, regardless, the film kept me anticipated, and I also enjoyed the inclusion of Taki's friends in helping him in times of need, and Mitsuha's friends, Tessie and Sayaka in their support
                  as well. An ambiguous end, but you're compelled to feel as though it couldn't have ended in any other way- I know for sure if they'd added any more it would've dampened the level of enjoyment attained from watching this movie.",10,ThatWheatFlour

                It's a fantastic movie with very good story. The visual are very sharp and well detailed and the sound matches that. There are a many story similar to this one,   but no one is that well written. I think that by adding the time factor with the soul swapping was a brilliant idea. The two main characters are attaching and what interesting about this kind of story is that you can't associate it to a boy movie or girl movie, either gender will take for either one of the main characters.

                ""Kimi No Na Wa"" is an absolute stunning anime. It has drama, a story, emotions and extremely beautiful ending. Everything about this anime is just one piece of anime art. I have a small review about it, as layman person. Here is what I would like to share:
Story: 9
There are higher dimensions like Time. There are concepts like Gravity, Love, Kindness which are never measured but are always felt. Science measures time in seconds and gravity in m/s^2 but it cannot measure the collapse, collesion, shrinking, rolling over and other super natural phenomenon. This anime does. This anime takes the example of threads and justifies
                  the ""time"" in such a accurate manner that my mind totally lost into the idea. Warmholes through time are only possible because, ""Unconditional Love"" is one entity which can travel through dimensions. Highschool students as a love is pretty neat thing to begin with. I am wowed.
Art: 10
Art is just great. I have layman experience in art and I cannot much tell if some drawing is good or how much good just by looking over it. I can tell about this anime because it touches the soul. There are some moments which are amazingly enough beautiful that people like me, will unknowningly smile and become cheerful. Masterpiece for a reason - I would say.
Sound: 10
I am asian - Neither Japanese person, Nor English person. However, I do understand English(R/W/L) quite well. I watched the anime in English subtitles but the voices of Japanese written script is still in my mind. Music is really really good, I am also simple person when it comes to sound and this anime has mastered this area of it as well. Even if you have not watched anime, just check out the music and you will be not disappointed at all.
Character: 9
I am a little confused about this catagory. I have 2 concepts behind this catagory, I will tell about each of them in short below:
 - If ""Character"" is meant to how the main characters look: If this is the case then, Art section has this explained well enough. Only question I have after anime, about the age of the both characters. It shows both are of age with time collesion of past and present (3 years). Well I think it does not matter as well anyway! :p
- ""Character"" is meant by the characteristics of individual - If it is the case then, I have nothing but positivity for the anime. Boy is boyish, girl is girlish, everything is in sync.
Enjoyment: 10
I enjoyed till my appetite, I couldn't resist to once so I watched more than once, amazing piece. I shared it to my friends. I will recommend it to people here. Go watch it, you will have no regrets afterwards.
Overall: 10
The piece of art, true romance/drama anime in modern picture. Physics is well described, Art is magnificent, sound is in sync with story so does the enjoyment of me. This anime deserves to be in top of it's class. Class apart!",10,mahmadmujtaba

                REVIEW WITH NO SPOILERS
After I heard so many people talking this anime was outstanding, i had a lot of expectations. But I need to be sincere: it had reach all of them!!
The animation is perfect! One of the best animations I've ever seen in my life (Shinkai been Shinkai). But all Works of Shinkai bring us a great animation... but then, he usually creates a weak story for his movies...
But Kimi No Na Wa has a great, inteteresting and deep story. The beggining is kind of slow but then you'll have fun and get surprised (maybe confused) in the middle of the movie.
If you want
                  to see a beautiful story and a perfect animation in one hour and a half, HERE IT IS!
JUST BEAUTIFUL!",9,JohnPerez

                This is a beautiful story with two main characters that are both relatable and also original at the same time I truly feel like they are people living with their own hopes and dreams and problems of their own. The art style is amazing on many occasions I paused just to take a screenshot the story itself is unpredictable and on many occasions really shocked me as I didn't see many twists coming. The sound is perfect in every scene the music makes it 100 times better. I watched with the sub and then rewatched with the dub. The dub is good for those who
                  wish to watch with a family who aren't used to the sub. If you enjoy comedies romances or even supernatural shows this is perfect for you. I even recommend this to people who aren't interested in any of those genres as this is just an all-around great movie that will make you cry and be happy and a whole bunch of emotions all at once in only if short run time. I felt more attached to these characters then I do in many anime series that have been running for years and this is only an hour and 45 minutes long. The only problem I would have with this anime is that it ended at all and that I've run out of excuses to rewatch it.",10,killermortx

                Finally managed to watch the movie for the second time. I was really looking forward to comparing my new thoughts with the initial ones. Plus I wanted to write some sort of a review either here or whatever to sort of memorize the experience.
I was really disappointed with the movie after the first watch. It's not like it didn't meet my expectations or something (because I don't usually watch trailers, read reviews and so on). Rather, it was down to that feeling that what I've just watched is both Shinkai's work and not Shinkai's work at the same time: it does contain most of his
                  beloved leitmotivs like trains, distant love, comets and so on, but it's as if they all worked in a different way in the new movie. Best comparison that comes to my mind is Wong Kar-wai's ""My Blueberry Nights"": they took one of the best Asian directors, put him in Hollywood, made him film a movie with the same vibe as usual, and what resulted is a shallow copy of any of his previous movies. Of course nothing like that happened with Shinkai, but seeing how the same elements do work in one movie, and don't work in another feels in a similar way.
Anyway. Watching the movie for the second time didn't really change anything. I guess for me movies of Shinkai were always about love with its bittersweet taste, filmed under a somewhat poetic point of view. At the same time story of the new movie seems.. what's the best word? too childish I believe. It's also strange seeing how something as simple as shoe workshop's adept getting in love with a stranger got replaced by cliche like time travelling. For the first time I couldn't feel emotionally attached to the story and characters when watching Shinkai's movie, which's my biggest disappointment with it. And unfortunately it's the sort of disappointment that can overshadow any visual or sound delights, which're undoubtedly at its finest in this movie.",7,mamazu

                It's one of those animes that pulls at your heartstrings by ramping up its sentimentality because why the fuck not? This anime will have you believe that there is a person out there somewhere that you're destined to be with. If this movie made you cry then I'll just assume that you're one of those people who cry every time a commercial about a dog with a Sarah McLachlan song comes on. This thing is really trying to hone in that message of ""if something is worth fighting for, go at it and never falter"". I wouldn't travel hundreds of miles just to see a
                  girl I barely know. Just because you happen to know something personal about her that nobody knows, that doesn't mean you know her better than everyone else. This is what twitch simps feel like when they've donated thousands of dollars to their favorite streamer, hoping they've made that personal connection through money. Get a fucking grip, you delusional moron.
It's a goddamn Shinkai movie, of course, it's gonna be pretty, atmospheric, and awe-aspiring. That's pretty much his staple.
The whole soundtrack itself evokes that feeling of longing and sentimentality. I believe RADWIMPS carried the fuck out of this movie. The way each score enhances every scene is astonishing. They could turn a scene with a pretty backdrop and a dull dialog into a charming moment. One of my least favorite parts of the score was the piano. The piano felt like a cue for people to start crying. It was utterly distracting. 
If you really wanna know more about the characters, just read the lyrics of Avril Lavigne's sk8r boi. 
Sorry Shinkai, it's going to take more than two high schoolers falling in love, to convince me that destiny is real. lol, what is up with this dude and his obsession with star-crossed lovers. He's recycled that concept at least 3 times now. I may not like this movie as much as everyone else, but I still appreciate his work. I'm also hoping that he would diverge from concepts where romance is its main element.",5,Hesternal

                You could say this review is a bit late but not gonna lie just watched the movie and its my favorite anime movie by far right in front of a silent voice. The story is so rich, It takes you down a path of character that go from complete strangers to ""friends"" back to strangers and it just repeats. The artwork is amazing the comet looked so beautiful in the cover art and you still wont be sad about it in the film. The sound quality was great, It had a bunch of different aspects like ambient sounds to the soundtrack right down to the
                  dialogue itself. The character's were all good they tried there best to not leave one character out of the story which was really great not gonna lie. The enjoyment was good at least in my case it had me getting happy to sad and just repeating. overall this is a great movie.",10,CarlosIsThankful
32281,"
                Kimi no na wa is a romantic shojo movie but certain changes, outstanding music, art, characters, and plot make it unique.
First things first, Art? The animation and artstyle are both crisp and soft on the eyes. Smooth animation and beautiful graphics, for sure a 10/10. 
Music? From what I noticed there were 4 different songs and some osts written for this anime. Fun thing is that I knew them all from rhythm games and games of all sorts, I would say each and every was a 10 or at least 9/10, goosebump-giving melodies and voice acting along with beautiful lyrics that match the movie. 10/10
                  for music
So what about the story, I will keep this part strictly unspoiled (except for the very basic things), for example, the story starts with two teenagers that change bodies when they dream/sleep. This is a great and genius way of bringing together two totally random people and putting each one on each others' shoes. They also learn to know and learn how each other feels. The director also uses several other unoriginal but amazing techniques to improve how this work of art makes you feel. Just because the story includes some pretty unoriginal techniques and it is pretty predictable at times, I have to give the story a 7/10. I like this body-swapping thing and other things but it lacks some romance.
The characters are fine, I will surely not forget about them, they also are pretty unique, interesting, and relatable, just original, good-looking, and realistic in general. I would say they deserve an 8/10.
As for my enjoyment, just like I said earlier I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I can tell why people absolutely loved and die for this anime. It is really unique, smart, well done, and crisp. 100% one you *must* watch. So..rating?  Well, I would give it an 8, it was enjoyable, well done and had some great music in it, the manga is pretty much what this anime was but without the great sound and animation, It just lacked some more romance, aced most categories but the story was a little weaker. 8/10, very good.",8,Alex_Jaro
32281,"
                This is unfortunately a case where I have a dissenting opinion on a very popular anime. I'm upset with myself and jealous that so many can adore this film while I had a mediocre experience.
Matoko Shinkai is a hit or miss director for me. All of his films are gorgeous and he has a unique animation style I wish was utilized more. However, he sometimes struggles with making an engaging story and relies on pure raw emotion to carry the films.
The Place Promised in our Early Days, 5 Centimeters per Second, and this film are examples of that. All of these films barely kept me
                  interested and was eventually bored by the end.
However, he has made truly great films in the past such as Children who Chase Lost Voices and Voice of a Distant Star which is why I will always try to watch all of his films because I know he has the potential to create another classic.
The big problem I had was that the film centers around a romance blossoming between two characters who learn more about each other in a gender bender plotline which is a unique concept. However, I never got the sense the two were developing romantic feelings for each other - I was seeing their interactions as more becoming best friends behavior. So when the characters eventually said out loud their romantic feelings for each other it both felt out of nowhere and hollow.
This was also the first time in a Shinkai film where I also felt the direction of the film had strange decisions. The film has a TV style opening theme credits with a lousy band singing over a montage. It was jarring and didn't fit at all. In fact, all the song choices throughout the film were bad honestly. 
Also, certain character choices and behaviors were executed awkwardly which took away from the immersion. 
Ultimately, its a miss for me. Its by no means a terrible film, and I can still understand why someone casual to anime would love it. I just couldn't get immersed into the story and care about the characters and was being distracted too many times by the story choices. There are better animes out there that can deliver the same amount of feels and with unique stories to boot.",5,EvenWeirder

                Kimi no Na wa ""Your name"" was probably so far one of the best anime movies I've seen so far. 
The Story of the movie was at first kind of a cliche but as soon as the movie progresses the story gets more intense as you don't know what might happen next. I felt like they didn't rush the anime in anyway or in any scene. You could say the pacing was great for it to be a movie. So what puts the cherry on top of the story is that it may be simple but it will keep you on the edge of the
                  seat and asking yourself: ""What happens next??""
Story: 10/10
The Art was pretty well-done as well. Sometimes it felt like as if it was a 3-D anime with their movements. Unlike most anime movies, they put a lot of effort in every single movement in the anime and it helps beautify the scenery on what they are doing. They outdid themselves when they put every detail in creating the comet which for me was one of the most memorable scene in any anime movie or series. 
Art: 10/10
Character building in the movie was slightly done or slightly rushed. I felt like the could've made a few extra minutes to develop or focus more on the two mains in the future. But since they used a limited time window I felt like they did a pretty good job in doing so because even though I'm a bit unsatisfied where they left of, it's pretty obvious on what's happening next.
Character: 8/10
I really enjoyed the movie as much as the next person would, we all probably laughed, cried, cringed, or maybe even relate in some way to the movie. There were times I would get a bit frustrated when the scene doesn't act out the way I want to or expect it to but it did do what few other anime movies or series made me do: kept me on my seat and watch to see what happens next and it kept me of the edge. It was really suspenseful and breath taking to see how the movie played out so it would be best to pay attention right from the start or you would get lost in some part of the movie.
Enjoyment: 10/10
So overall I really loved the Story which was really well done. The Art would really take your breath away. The Sound was fine I liked the soothing theme song of the movie which perfectly matched the movie and it's scenery so much. Character development could've been done better but it turned out just fine. I really enjoyed the movie it was a lost for words and just flat out amazing on how the story goes or whenever it takes a turn to where you don't expect what's gonna happen next.",10,An1meWatcher

                I watched the movie when I was new to anime. I had watched around 10 anime and was amazed by how good this movie was. It's been over a year now and I have watched over 300 anime( I watch a lot of anime). As time passed by and I thought back at the anime I believed the show to be a bit overrated and not that good. So I rewatched it yesterday....
And I remembered how I actually felt when I watched the movie first time. I was astounded by the sheer epicness of the movie. Each and every aspect of the movie has been
                  handled beautifully. The art and animation is so majestic, it feels like the whole scenario is happening in real. The immersive realism of this show makes you forget you are watching an anime.
Before rewatching the movie I remembered the anime to have a really good ost( Kataware doki) and a couple good songs. After rewatching it I can say the movie has a number of epic ost that again immerse you in the epicness of the show. And yes, Kataware doki is as beautiful as ever.
The plot of the show is beautiful and the characters so amazing, I can safely say it's one of the greatest romantic movies I have seen in my life. The depiction of characters in the show is done in such a way that you get connected to the characters in just 10 minutes into the movie. 
Today a lot of people are calling your name overrated as I did before. I think they need to re-watch it to relive the experience of the movie.
A show is called a classic if it stands the test of time and gives you the same pleasure you got while watching it for the first time years ago. And having rewatched the movie I can safely say that Your name is an absolute classic.",10,Mr_Srijan

                What a great movie. Honestly, it was a really sweet and touching film, and I'm really glad I watched it. I'm gonna start out by outlining some of the negatives I had with this film because there aren't many.
The story in the beginning isn't as clearly laid out as it could've been as far as the timeline went. I got the general idea of when these two characters were changing places, but I would've liked to know how frequently it happened, what was flashback and what was present day, that kind of thing. It got a little convoluted, though I suppose timelines don't really matter
                  in the grand scheme of the movie. I also feel like the movie could've done with another fifteen minutes to half an hour of content because some sections would've been benefited from that expansion. For instance, rather than have a montage of these two characters as each other, the movie could've slowed it down and shown more detail.
That's about all the bad I have. Moving on: the art. Oh, my goodness. It's gorgeous. It's literally like watching a moving painting. The landscapes specifically are to die for. On top of that, the music is absolutely lovely and beautiful. The music that was chosen was brilliant to set the tone and direction of the movie. I think these two things really drove the film overall.
Of course, on top of that, the story and the characters were phenomenal. They didn't get fleshed out much because this is a movie not a series, but I still felt really connected with them, which is always a good thing.
I think this film is a great one for anyone to watch, regardless of your genre style. I'd really recommend it, I came away from it with some great emotions, and I think everyone should experience it as well.",9,BabyGirl06301

                Everyone once in a while we come across a modern master piece that makes us feel like we are part of a journey and this is where the film,""Kimi no Na wa.""(Your name), impresses. There's something rather alluring about this movie. Love that transcends all boundaries of space, time and memory, it is this kind of love that this movie so brilliantly portrays. No wonder that at the time of writing, this is the highest rated anime on MAL. This film was a revelation in mant ways, a revelation as to just how good an animated film can be.
The movie introduces us to two characters
                  with different lives but the same feeling. I don't want to mention a lot about the story sinceI don't want to give out any spoilers. However, take it from me, the story is absolutely brilliant, the narrative is masterfully crafted, so much so that it makes me want to just jump into it's world. The story does have a few moments where it doesn't impress but these moments are so few and far in between that it is hard to notice them. Whatever shortcomings the story has, which as I mentioned are very few, are absolutely steamrolled by the beauty of how the world of Kimi No Na Wa looks. The art style is just so amazing. I almost screamed like a fanboy pining away for his idol when I first saw what the film actually looked like. The film looks absolutely stunning. There's just nothing that is bad with the animation. The soundtrack, oh the soundtrack, it is just such a huge part of the film. The sound conveys a lot of emotions that sometimes the dialogues can't. Every high point for the two characters is just wonderfully portrayed.
Now let's move on to the most important and undoubtedly the best part of Kimi No Na wa., the two main characters. There's just so many things that make them great. They may appear to be the clichéd city boy, small town girl, characters at first but as time progressess, we get to delve in the complexities of these two people. They are just amazing, coupled with the story and the soundtrack, we just get drawn into their characters. We feel there anguish, there elation and all the other emotions they feel. Before long, we start identifying ourselves with these people even if we have absolutrly nothing in common with them. That's what sets this film apart and makes it a an amazing one.

The story is one of the best romance stories of the last decade and the animation is top notch. This movie has some of the most beautiful shots I've seen in anime and it truly mesmerised me with its visuals. Overall this movie is a classic masterpiece and I truly believe that everyone

I watched it a few years back with a friend, and I'm not quite sure why, but at the end I felt like there were a ton of plot holes and I didn't quite enjoy it. Also didn't understand what all the hype was about. I thought back and decided it's time to give it a second chance, and I am so happy I did. Now that I knew the core of the story, my goal was to follow the details, so this time I can have a better grasp of
                  what's going on. While on my mission I also realized that I was actually having fun, unlike the first time. The story came together in front of my eyes, piece by piece, perfectly. I could finally get behind the characters, feel their emotions, cry my eyes out (because no good movie is complete without pulling your heart out of your chest and stabbing it until it bleeds painfully).

                Review of Kimi no na wa/ Your name:
First off I would like to say what an amazing movie this is. From the beginning of the movie to the end I was emotionally hooked and was crying like a baby
Story: The story was brilliant. It had limitations but had a lot of room to change the direction of the story and still have you hooked. The story's basis is around amnesia so you can probably see why there were limitations. However, Makoto used this to his advantage and created the most amazing movie I have ever seen. 
Music: The music is simply amazing. It swells in
                  all the right places, fits the characters moods perfectly really helping to portray their emotions. Three full songs by Radwimps are slotted within the movie, all with fitting lyrics to the scenes to help you become emotionally connected with the Characters.
Characters:
In the film there are only 2 main characters. The rest of the supporting cast though, are not forgotten. They really help you to understand the main characters and are definitely not left out appearing around the characters almost all of the time that you see them. The main characters are well developed throughout the story giving you time to know them instead of just throwing all the information at you at once. Though some will say there was not much to them in means of personality I have to disagree. These characters are high school students therefore there will not be much to them. They both have their hobbies and that's about it because you wouldn't have some normal high school student, in a normal world, going out and fighting monsters, because where would the monsters be, and kids don't do that! Even so the characters have quirky attributes, one is a shrine maiden and one is aspiring to be an architect. These traits are not left behind either because they help to bring the characters together.
Art and animation:
The art and animation in this film is simply stellar. The animation is so smooth and realistic that I was captivated by it the whole time. The realism in all of the places and sketches is amazing and is simply breath taking. Only one other time have I seen such a beautiful movie and I have to say that Kimi no Na wa knocks that one out of the park.
Overall I think Kimi no Na wa is a beautiful romance, fantasy anime movie and any anime fan has to watch this at least once just so they know how simply amazing this is.",10,EmWantsToBattle

The musics are perfect and the voices actor too.

                THIS REVIEW HAS A FEW SPOILERS
The art is really good but the creator quite obviously is fond of his skyward shots and sliding doors. The sound would be a solid 8 without the saliva sake. The character would have had a much higher score if he was not as big an idiot and just wrote his name on her hand instead of ""i love you"". I was quite upset at how the main characters turned out at the end, as the girl got less attractive and the guy is jobless which remind me of myself. Overall a very enjoyable movie.

                Kimi no Na wa (your name.) is a true work of art. From start to finish, the animation, character development, and story were beautifully crafted. In my opinion, one of the best Japanese anime films out there, having some of the best animation ever in an animated Japanese movie. 
Just rewatched for Fathers day and is a must-watch even for those just starting to watch Japanese anime. Crazy to think that the scenes were all hand-drawn, using no Computer Generation. This is how animes should be developed and it was beautiful to see all of the work they put into developing this Masterpiece of a
                  film. Planning to watch more by the director Makoto Shinkai and hope that he goes on to produce even more 10/10 films like this. Thoroughly enjoyed all of my time with this work.",10,sox1box

                If there ever was a beautiful film, Your Name is it. It’s a work of art— a bedazzling visual spectacle. The score, animation, and overall concept weave together to deliver a nearly impeccable and emotional journey.
In almost two hours of runtime, not a moment is wasted. Shinkai’s concept is grand, putting a clever twist on the body-swapping subgenre. Although such a concept seems to suggest nothing more than a teen romance movie, in traditional Shinkai fashion, it’s elevated miles beyond its potential. The peculiar collision of Taki and Mitsuha’s life starts conventionally, but later becomes quite cerebral. Sometimes, a little too much.
As much as the
                  plot can be uncompromising, its rewards are well worth the attention. Perhaps Your Name is a movie about a feeling rather than a person. It plays a bit like a folktale, explaining human experiences in a broader, fantastical fashion. It’s not a character study. The main cast receives just enough development to allow the story to lead the way.
Underscoring the film is the breathtaking score by Radwimps, which plays a major role in tying together the film’s efficient pacing. It’s nice on the ears and uplifting, though it steers close to being a bit one-note.
If you sit down to watch Your Name with the intention to pick apart the plot holes, you’re watching the wrong movie. Rather, its genius is found in its efficiency, artistry, and fantasy. Elegant and spotless, the film sends a message that strikes somewhere deep in the soul.",8,ZeroNorth

                This is one of the few anime I've watched where I've been forced to give serious thought and reflection on it for days after I'd seen it. In fact, I'm writing this three days after I finished the movie.
I believe that ""Kimi no Na wa"" is the height of Shinkai's storytelling. Almost immediately, we are engrossed and deeply care about our two protagonists, and what they do. He takes these interactions to make something meaningful out of the story. While the first of the three sections (if you will) is definitely the lightest in tone, the over-arcing wastes no time in plunging you head-long into
                  the full story. Instead of just playing it for laughs, the story makes an interesting scenario that pays off in spades later, as well as developing that characters and the world around them. This is something I strongly commend, as a problem I had with ""5 Centimeters per Second"" was that I was never really able to connect with or care about the characters (in part due to a lack of backstory and development), and thus never deeply care about the events they got into. No matter where you are in this film, there is always something to keep your attention on, always something to make you smile. There's less of a drive for ""thematic consistency,"" and more of an engaging experience for the audience.
The art is gorgeous and breathtaking. Sadly, I only got to watch it in 720p -- something I will definitely rectify once it's been officially released in the states.
RADWIMPS brings an electrically exciting musical atmosphere to the table, and it certainly delivers. As opposed to the soft-spoken and gentle tracks composed by Tenmon for previous Shinkai films, the music helps to shift the gears and mindset of the viewer, while still being balanced and soft-spoken where necessary.
The only main complaint I may have with this film is the minor spattering of plot holes or ""conveniences"" that show up as a result of making a romance sci-fi. This by no means takes away from the overall experience, rather, just makes some elements of the film harder to suspend disbelief of than others.
Ultimately, ""your name."" is an exemplary example of change for the better. Shinkai left everything alone that worked, and changed things that benefited the work in the long run. It’s funny, entertaining, gripping, engaging, moving, and romantic, all while having a pretty solid base story line. I'm looking forward to re-watching this in the near future, and crying all over again.",9,codedeeply

                Let me just say that this was not the movie I signed up for. The movie I signed up for was about a high school guy living in Tokyo and a high school girl living in the country who switch bodies and have to adjust to their new lives. The first half of the movie does do this but then...without spoiling anything...the plot throws a rather dark curve ball that nobody seeing this for the first time could have seen coming. The film is an emotional roller coaster but unfortunately the most common parts of the ride were confusion mixed with disappointment.
Story: 6
The weakest part
                  of Kimi no Na Wa is its story. Apart from the aforementioned ""not what I signed up for"" aspect, the movie feels like 3 plots in one. I almost feel like the writer(s) of this movie couldn't make up their mind where they wanted the plot to go and so had it go in multiple directions. Now while everything does tie together nicely I personally felt myself let down by the whole experience. Perhaps had I gone into this movie completely blind without reading what it was supposedly about I would feel differently but then again I probably wouldn't have seen it then. Its very hard to talk about the plot without spoiling anything so let me just say that the storyline isn't really bad so much as indecisive and the tone shifts dramatically between all 3 acts. I do give the writers credit for some neat ideas and twists on the whole body switching thing but I felt like they decided that wasn't enough for their movie and...well can't say that because of spoilers.
Art: 10
As disappointing as the story is the art and animation is just straight up eye candy from start to finish. I have seen animation this good before...but much like the main characters in this movie I honestly can't remember where that was. The landscapes and scenery in particular are very detailed and well drawn (which they should be considering their importance to the plot). I will say that the animation of characters themselves leaves a bit to be desired but I will save that for later and just say that the art is just a pleasure to view in this movie.
Sound: 7
There are some movies I watch and quickly look up a song so I can get it to listen to because it was awesome in the movie. There are also movies where I feel the soundtrack or voice acting actually drag the movie down. Kimi no Na Wa falls into the 3rd category of films where I remember thinking that they did a good job with the soundtrack and voice acting but not so good that anything stuck out as being amazing. The voice actors do their job well enough and the music fits the emotion of the scenes fairly well but nothing about the sound in this movie blew me away.
Character: 5
Along with the plot, the characters in this film are actually quite disappointing. First off the opening parts of the film make it seem like Mitsuha is going to be the focus of the plot but then part way through the movie Taki takes over. Ill admit it was funny the first time we see Taki in Mitsuha's body (and he does the first thing that any boy in that situation would do to verify being in a female body) but Taki is actually the biggest character flaw in the film. Early on we see Mitsuha's life and how she is unhappy living in her small town, this makes her a complex enough character to be believable and we want to know what is going to happen to her in the film. Unfortunately most of the rest of Kimi no Na Wa focuses on Taki who can't really grow because we never see much of his starting point. The audience is never introduced to Taki before the switches start and so we don't know how he feels about his life in Tokyo, we don't know much about his problems or family or ambitions before he met/became Mitshuha. Its similar to how Assassin's Creed 3 introduced an interesting character at the beginning of the game but then spent most of the game focusing on a rather bland character and that, sadly, is Taki. 
Also I should mention that Kimi no Na Wa glosses over its supporting cast hard. Outside of the main two character the rest of the characters in the movie are basically stereotypes that include the following: girl's little sister, girl's best friend, girl's guy friend, guy's goofy friend, guy's serious friend, strict father, etc. All these characters look and behave exactly as dictated by their stereotype. Honestly the only minor character who was at least partially interesting in this film was Mitsuha's grandmother.
Enjoyment: 7
A funny thing happened while I was watching the 3rd act of Kimi no Na Wa...I said to my self ""This sort of reminds me of 'The Girl who Leapt Through Time'. Looking back on it I have to say that Girl who Leapt Through Time is simply a better movie than Kimi no Na Wa. Other than having a much more grounded plot (which is saying something given the sci-fi time travel thing) the film is also more enjoyable to watch. Its odd that we want movies to surprise us but sometimes they can surprise us in disappointing ways. I was all set for Kimi no Na Wa to set up the body swap plot trope and then use the rest of the movie for the main characters to learn more about each other by living each others' lives and then growing as a result. Since that was simply not the movie I got I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought. Again maybe I would have enjoyed the movie more if I went into this movie completely blind but well I at least like to know a movie's premise before I decide to watch it or not. All that being said, the ending of Kimi no Na Wa is good enough to merit the film a 7 instead of a 6 since it ties up its main plot well enough.
Overall: 7
At time of writing Kimi no Na Wa is the topped ranked anime on MyAnimeList and I cannot for the life of me understand why. Yes its good, I am not disputing that, but its certainly not a masterpiece in any way except maybe visually. I read some of the more recent reviews (after I wrote the other sections of this review) and found out that many people are starting to seem to calm down about the movie and look at it with more perspective (sort of like how people stopped freaking out about Frozen after several months...though to be fair Frozen did live up to its initial hype). Hopefully overtime the ratings on Kimi no Na Wa will come down into the low 9s or high 8s but as for myself I give it a 7 out of 10. On my list it has the same score as things like Fate/stay night, School Rumble, .hack//Sign,  Ouran Host Club, and Suzumiya Haruhi.",7,seekster

                Not going to write too much, but the various emotions this movie is filled with will drag you into it until the very end.
The best part about this movie is that it doesn't leave you on a cliffhanger like most anime movies do. Keep yourself guessing and write about a million AUs and stress about it for the rest of your life. It is the exact opposite. 
I have always been fond of movies that start at a slightly slower pace, pick up eventually at the middle and then finish off with a blast or a peaceful epilogue. This movie has all those things. 
By
                  far the best animation I have seen. The art, the characters and the overall motion animation of the film are too love. If you are in love with art this is it for you. he characters are very lovable. Unlike many series/OVAs/movies you may witness, you either have problems with one of the main characters or the side characters, but in kimi no na wa I have been debating over who to like more. Each of the characters has their unique identity and are equally important and are provided with sufficient amount of screen time to fill in all their plots. 
If you are a crazy romantic this is it for you. Until the end it may keep you guessing whether or not it may be. It is an experience on a completely familiar as well as new all together.

                This film is quite an anomaly for me personally, because not only do I rarely watch anime movies, but I have also never given a full 10/10 score to an anime before. This may be because I am simply critical as a reviewer by nature, but I think that moreover, it is really just because no series has been able to develop every element of their show like Kimi no Na wa has.
Overall, the concept of Kimi no Na wa is less to me an original take on an idea, but actually a developmental process combining elements of the traditional high school anime setting with
                  the elements of the exploration of the mechanics of time and space. Utilizing both a traditional Japanese cultural standpoint in addition to the anime themes we all are familiar with really serves to enhance the near-flawless development of the story.
A second developmental technique used to distinguish this film from many of its rivals is the repetition of ideas very early on in the movie, in addition to rapidly setting up a world that we as human beings can both relate to, but also question at the same time. The questions and answers proposed by the story are somehow perfected in timing to the point in which me, as a first-time viewer, can still maintain captivated by the development.
One dislike, however, from my personal standpoint, was the execution of the ending. Not to spoil anything in particular, but for me personally, an ending should be a resolution, not a recapitulation. The development of THEMES seemed to present themselves in such a prolific manner, that I felt a sense of emptiness at the end, even when the effective but simple literary technique of repetition was untilized near perfectly from an analytical perspective. This, however, really did lead me to wonder how the story itself actually ended. I suppose the producer does deserve the artistic liberties to present his own story how he sees fit, but once again, I must state how simply desolate and empty I felt upon the conclusion of this film.
All in all, Kimi no Na wa is a superb film, with a rapid developmental process and thematic presentations that can easily enthrall viewers. The film contains little to no downsides, and even though the story may seem to progress slowly at times, the masterful execution of the film as a whole will easily disguise any minor flaws.",10,Pvt_Diny

This anime was just a masterpiece, except for the characters. Although this is supposed to be what if two random kids were switching bodies type of show, and the characters are relateable and such, they were just that, two characters that are relateable. They were nothing special really.
Aside from that, the story was great, the plot twist was good, the concept was good, the only reason the story gets a 9 out of 10 is because of a few minor plot holes that could be explained, but weren't, so for all fairness, they count. One plot hole is, as many of
                  you know, neither Mitsuha nor Taki looked at the date and noticed something strange. One would think you would check. Another one is Mitsuha being 3 years older than Taki, not a huge deal, but the problem is it's not really common in real life, for a woman to date a guy 3 years younger. Aside from those, it's really good. Who would have thought they were living in two different eras.

Because of the time axis being out of sync, the two characters are in different places and can't see each other very often.
This is one of the reasons why the scene where Taki and Mitsuha meet at the end of the movie makes me feel so emotional.
While ""Weathering with you"" portrays Shinjuku as an adult or a negative image, this film portrays Shinjuku as a sparkling, fashionable,
                  and nice town.
Mitsuha cut her hair probably because she went to Tokyo to see Taki, but did not remember who she was and felt heartbroken. In other words, Tesshi's guess was probably correct.

                A romantic adventure of sorts, Kimi No Nawa dove to the same emotional depth in around two hours that even the best anime take years (and hundreds of episodes) to reach. 
Set in modern Japan, Kimi No Nawa captures the stories of two distant teens - a city boy from Tokyo and a rural girl from a distant town. One day, the two wake up and find themselves in each others body. The movie beautifully captures their respective journeys in learning about themselves, about each other, and clinging on to strands of hope to find each other.
(Don’t fret, no spoilers)
At first, the plot seems almost
                  too ordinary: you know, ‘girl and boy switch places…blah blah blah.’ That being said, the simple things done right are better than the complex things done poorly. This movie is so intricately coordinated and executed that it let the plot shine and really portray a fuller story. And just as you think you have the movie figured out, toward the end the slight mysteries and complexities in the plot emerge. And they do so cleanly. Although I do not know if there is a manga or a novel to accompany Kimi No Nawa, my laud for this movie is so strong that I undoubtedly presume that the movie is better than its paper counterpart. 
The animation and sound are equally beautiful; they strongly contribute to this emotional powerhouse. I don’t know why, but I vividly remember the vibrant color scheme. Maybe it’s because the colors subtly highlight the beauty of their adventures or simply create a really visually enjoyable scene. The audio playback is just phenomenal. There is an opening, two or three interludes, and a powerful finale. All of which are inseparable from the overall effect.
So I’ve referred this so-called “emotional impact” multiple times throughout my review. I presume that if you watched any anime dealing with relationships (or just good media in general), you probably have felt a connection inside. Maybe because of a longing to be like the character; maybe because of a desire to see the best for everyone; maybe because of an innate prayer that hope is fulfilled. Whatever it may be, Kimi No Nawa will channel those feelings. It really is like a prayer - that amongst a strong, you hope against all odds that your love and support for someone will find a home. This movie will really hit you in the softest of spots. 
Lastly, I want to point out one keen observation that Kimi No Nawa has taught me. I consider myself to be a relatively tough movie critic because I am incredibly vested in good acting. That is why with real human acting, there is a tremendous grading scale - from 1 to 100. The distribution is pretty normally distributed, with most movies falling in the 50’s, few in the 10’s and few in the 90’s. With anime, it is quite different. Since human expression is limited to voice, and the possibilities with animation are far greater, the distribution is definitely skewed to the left - with an average of say 70. Now, even the best anime will never be as great as the best human movie, so no anime can exceed 90. And since its pretty hard to really fuck up an anime, the anime grading scale is from 30 to 90. 1 to 100 versus 30 to 90. Just a thought. 
Excluding popular shonen anime movies (eg. Naruto and Hunter X Hunter), Kimi No Nawa was my first anime movie. And I’m pretty sure it’s gonna be the best. Hell - I am probably gonna watch it a few more times.",9,KingBaloo

                I've initially rated Your Name a 6/10.  I do not fully remember why, all I felt was it was not deserving for its high rating. I've rewatched it now and reevaluated. 
In terms of the story, I believe it is great and is deserving for its high ratings. It mixed well the light and serious tones; the situation of body swapping was entertaining to watch, and considering their ages it seems to be what you'd expect to happen. In times of seriousness, the uncertainty of the swapping costs for some consequences to their lives, and it was well played at the climax when the
                  disappearance randomly happened. 
Complemented by Makoto Shinkai's direction of the art and music, the story tugs at your heartstrings at the right timing. I've seen the movie twice by now, and I believe I still felt the same goosebumps as when I first watched it. 
The only problem I could see, and as mentioned already by most in the community, their relationship seems to be grounded only by emotions that were really not clear to both of them. I did not see them establish an actual relationship, one that would manifest their love for each other. A friendship would have been much more likely given that they have only bickered about what they do with each other's body when they swapped. The movie suddenly 'established' that they have feelings for each other. Having rewatched it, the scene where they've set rules for each other during the swap was their only interaction with which they are then seen to be feeling sad and jealous. The movie then sets their love as the driving force to meet each other. I feel that this is a vital point which hinders the movie from being a masterpiece. Had they presented an actual interaction that can hold their feelings of love, it could justify their seemingly irrational (to the eyes of their friends) actions. But if the point of all of these is that 'it must be fate' or that  'the red string of fate moved them close' is what drove them to be with each other, then so be it. I just think that it portrays them as weak characters, that are only moved by impulse. 
To conclude, I've reevaluated it to a 9/10. The placement of the plot, music, and the animation makes this an effective film to move our hearts. I would have given it a 10, if not for the interaction of the characters as a missed opportunity.",9,rotanrotan1

                What is love?
A question we have all asked ourselves at least ten times. Is it physical attraction? A desire for reproduction? Or is it a pure emotional connection? Is it limited to romantic love, and is that love greater, lesser than, or equal to platonic live of family and friends? Come to think of it, are emotions purely based on memory, or are they something far greater?
Can you love something or someone you don't know, or can't remember?
Your Name is the absolute embodiment of this idea. To keep out of spoilers, it tells a tale of a love long lost to something out of control
                  of the protagonists, something drifting them further and further apart. Desire their obvious connection through body-swapping, their progress to understanding and finding each other is always blocked. They still remember, though. They remember their feelings. Though it never says so directly, this can be related to nostalgia: memory purely ruled by emotions, rather than any kind of logic or common sense. It's not a complex story - it's rather simple. But the emotions - the emotions are strong, meaningful, complex.
The movie illustrates the protagonists' struggles completely with absolutely gorgeous artistic merit. This isn't the kind of story to be told by a smart, witty script - a story of feelings outside of memory needs to evoke emotions in something out of logic - art. The animation and visuals are, by far, some of the best I've ever seen in any movie, with so many scenes giving me chills just by looking at nothing more, nothing less, than a beautiful view. The music is amazing as well, with the Radwimp's soundtrack bringing out emotions I really can't describe. That, however, can just be said for anything within this perfect movie. The opening scene, the big twist, the trip through Mitsuha's life, the entire third act - all are some of the most extraordinary things I've ever seen.
Yes, there are flaws in this movie, probably in the development of characters. But the actual scale of these mistakes, at least to me, are absolutely minuscule. Although it might not deserve it, I think this is a 10/10 masterpiece.",10,CookieFrog

                I guess everything was already said about ""Kimi no Na wa"" but  I will give you my oppinion about this movie as short as possible.
I know I'm late, I just finished it a few minutes ago, but I feel now was the best moment, after all the hype had gone. With all that said, please enjoy my short review.
First, the story was awseome (9/10). I really enjoyed the whole concept, even though, you could predict the ending after some time of watching. I feel like it was a very well written fiction.
The art was simply beautiful (10/10). I'm not a huge fan of CGI,
                  but here it was perfect. I really do feel like it helped the whole presentation.
The sound without any comment (10/10). Every single sound was in harmony with the setting, the whole atmosphere was built very well.
Characher developement (8/10). It's a shame I can't give more but honestly, the developement was too fast. In short, it's shown to us only a little about the protagonists, about their lives, which makes them develop feelings so swftly, we don't know where they came from. I know it's a movie and they need to fit in 2 hours, but here it should've been looked upon a little more. This is, for me at least, the biggest flaw of the movie.
Enjoyment (9/10). I can say a really enjoyed this, but I don't consider it a masterpiece to rate it with 10. 
Overall (9/10) Overall, it was a good eperience, and I can say i'm happy I haven't seen it when it aired, and waited until the hype over it had dissapeared. If you haven't watched ""Kimi no Na wa"" until now, and are reading this, I recommend to do it now. It won't disappoint you.",9,MangoWolf13

                Your Name manages to paint an insanely broad stroke of appeal without being convenient or contrive which is no small feat. Working as a highschool romance, escapist fantasy and a multilayered sci fi. It even utilizes cityboy smalltown girl archetypes to it's advantage. It actually starts off rather unimpressively with its seemingly arbitrary freaky-friday premise, lighthearted teen romanticism and arguably sexist overtones... but when it begins to find a dramatic stage the story quickly races into suspense as pieces of the puzzle fall into place. As with any Anime romance it clashes not once but twice with substantial melodramatic overtures but it's never a cheap
                  feeling. Despite the protagonists almost lack of personality they feel real, even the supporting cast gets subtly fleshed out throughout the film. This masterful attention to detail in character portrayal makes a satisfactory end when the curtain closes. Shinkai really knows how to play on a demographic's longing for purpose. Taki and Mitsuha appear to go through much hardship but how awfully wonderful would it be to have your life's purpose defined for you in a supernatural event that leads to an extraordinary love?",10,NeilMenon

                Prelim: I watched Your name on blu ray after it was released in 2017, and recently rewatched it for the purpose of this review.
STORY- 8/10
Your name's story follows two main characters and a plethora of supporting characters. The two mains, Taki and Mitsuha, swap bodies and live each other's lives across a time gap that may be slightly more sinister than first insinuated. The story a good number of the points a perfect story should hit. It is consistently impactful, there are real and genuine stakes, it is moving and powerful throughout the entire film, however, it is somewhat predictable, which does not significantly detract
                  from the experience but is something to consider. One of my few complaints about the story is that it ends, as in it ends without a full conclusion. It is a GOOD ending, but it is somewhat lacking in closure.
ART-11/10
Ah, the art. The animation. Let me phrase this correctly so none of the tone is understated. This is, the best-looking animation I have ever seen. The single most beautiful piece of animation my eyes have ever laid their gaze on. This looks better than Picasso, better than da Vinci, and better than Michelangelo. In my personal opinion, this movie will never be beaten animation-wise. It looks too ridiculously good.
SOUND-10/10
Some of the score that RADWIMPS composed for this film continues to be incredibly good after constant re-listens. Dream lantern, Zenzenzense, Sparkle, and Nandemonaiya are still some of my favorite score songs up until this day. The actual sound design for the movie is also incredible, and Yamada Haru continues to show his pure expertise in the sound design field.
CHARACTERS-8/10
Being a movie, the characters are obviously not going to be as deep or as developed as you would find in your typical anime, having significantly more time to develop these characters and have the audience grow attached to them. What is impressive, however, is the amount of depth that Shinkai was able to draw from these characters. For such a short running time, these characters, especially Taki and Mitsuha, manage to still achieve a level of depth and relativity that keeps the audience engaged. The side characters, on the other hand, are somewhat lacking in this department, which is obvious due to the amount of time the movie actually had to develop them.
ENJOYMENT-11/10
This is one- possibly the most- an enjoyable movie I have ever watched. I would struggle to say Koe No Kitachi surpasses it. I cried, then cried some more. Both tears of sadness and joy. If you are on the fence about the amount of emotional return you will get from this movie, don't be, and watch it.
OVERALL-10/10
Overall, just watch it. You lose nothing and gain everything. What I said a second ago about struggling to say Koe No Kitachi beats this out? I can confirm that. This movie beats it. Literally, just watch it.",10,ahrahkui

                This movie teaches you even if you have a cliché plot you can do something beautiful. A work of art, it's the second time I've seen it and by God I had forgotten how beautiful it was. The animation is incredible, the soundtrack is masterful, there are no words when you put together good animation with an incredible soundtrack, magic comes out. That magic that catches your heart and you don't want to do anything but cry about how beautiful it is.

I absolutely love this movie, and it could be one of my favorites of all times, however the story puts a serious damper on this.
Although overall an awesome movie, I simply didn't really enjoy the manga as much(and yeah, it's a movie review, but the manga showed me, that the story wasn't as great as the movie made it seem) and all of the impactful scenes were simply lacking something, so the didn't really touch me in the way the movie touched me, frankly speaking, they didn't touch me at all, which likely was due to the lack of that fantastic music, and the stunnig visuals. especially since the manga's visuals aren't really top tier.
I couldn't put it into words much better. Just read the manga and you'll likely see, why the Story only got a seven.",9,Fallie

                This is a movie that I actually put off watching for some time.  With all the hype surrounding it there was such a high bar being set for me.  It's like a pressure that if I watch it and it does not deliver that it might have been ruined by all that buildup.  Thankfully, after a few years, I've taken the time to sit back and enjoy it.  Even with all the pressure, it truly lived up to it's experience.
Story; 8/10
Nothing extremely out of the ordinary in a sense of high school feels.  Definitely a fun perspective on jumping bodies
                  to the opposite sex who is also living a dramatically different lifestyle.  The concept of the full story rolling out does well in blending the beginning lighthearted elements into a deeper story.  You get to really feel some of the anxiety and missing pieces with the characters as the story progresses.
Art; 10/10
Not much to be said here other than the movie looks beautiful.  The contrasting skylines between the country and city give you a lot of landscape to play with.  From the daily look of the apartments to the beauty of a starry night sky, everything is well done.
Sound; 9/10
While the music did not stretch through every scene, when it was there it fit very well.  There's only moments with a noticeable soundtrack but it feels right with the moving.  The light and soft lyrics delivered by the Radwimps was a fitting choice.  If you were to pull the Youtube for the Radwimps orchestra set that was performed for the movie, you'll find yourself immersed as well.
Characters; 8/10
With a compressed character lineup due to the obvious time of a movie,  they do a good job getting to know the character now.  While they were not overwhelming standouts for their personalities, it was able to still get you involved in how they were feeling.  Side characters exist without feeling like they need to be deep as well.  They are fine revolving around the main cast.
Enjoyment; 10/10
Again, even after all the anticipation I had effectively built up for myself, the movie was a 10/10 for me here.  I like the startup feel that was light and smooth to move through.  The transition to bring depth to the characters lives by using the changing days with changing bodies brought extra spice.  It's ability to transition to a sort of mystery and showcasing feelings that transition through time kept me engaged all the way to the end.  While not the tearjerker that some other powerhouses have delivered, you can get emotionally involved in the events.
Overall; 9/10
I think anime fans should encourage those that may not be as much into anime to also watch this movie.  It's a very wholesome feel that doesn't fall into the perceptive anime stigmas.  If you're looking to have some emotional investment without a big hit to the tear bucket, this is it.  It does not quite get the emotions flowing compared to some other titles out there, but don't let that stop you from enjoying the experience it has to offer.",9,sukottojc

                The Story:
The story was told in an outstanding way. It may have been slightly confusing in the beginning, but when you continue watching, the story starts making more and more sense. In the end I had shivers going down my spine because of the powerful emotions the movie emitted. The story was complex but that makes it, to my opinion, even better. It is unpredictable what is going to happen next and the movie kept me on edge every second I was watching it. There are a lot of emotional moments and it all comes together in the end and makes you feel very satisfied.
                  9/10.
The Art:
The art style is incredible. Everything is made detailed and makes you feel like this story could have happened in the past. The scenery is breathtaking and really makes it feel like you are watching a romance / slice of life anime. All the people were made fairly detailed and the art style somehow makes them look like incredible people. The art style doesn't change throughout the movie. It keeps being very detailed and beautiful. 10/10.
The Sound:
The voice actors did a great job. They really sounded like the characters and their voices fit in great. The sound effects such as explosions were extremely realistic and made the movie even more outstanding. There is nothing bad to say about the sound quality. It's magnificent. 10/10.
The Characters:
The characters felt like real people. They showed the exact right emotions and the exact right time. It really felt like the characters were people living right now, especially since the anime found place around 2013 in the movie itself. It was very realistic and it's very easy to sympathize with the characters in the anime. 10/10.
The Enjoyment:
This anime movie has been my best movie of all time that I have watched. It's really powerful and made me shiver all over my body. If I could cry I would have. It's extremely realistic and I especially sympathized with the 2 main characters. I felt very frustrated at times when it seemed like there was no way out of misery for the main characters but luckily the movie ended very satisfying. I loved this movie, definitely going to rewatch it. 9/10

                While I ultimately did like this movie I do have to say something. If I were to rate is movie on art and sound it would undoubtedly be a 10/10, but I personally give it a 5 because of the story. Thing is the story isn't bad, it's heart warming and nice but there's one major problem. If I were to describe Kimi no Na wa in one word it would be confusing. Once the second half started I had no idea who was where and why for almost the rest of the movie. It doesn't help that this movie mixed not only the idea
                  of a time limit till the destruction of a town, but also time travel AND body swapping. I could barely understand why things were happening and what had changed because of the main characters actions. This ultimately bogged down the movie for me. To me the movie got too big for it's britches. In my opinion it should really only have had the theme of body swapping, the time travel just made it hard to follow. Also one thing I need to bring up is that all the characters felt blander than whole wheat toast. I feel like I've seen all of these kinds of characters in anime or in other movies and I've seen them done a hell of a lot better. I don't regret watching the movie nor did I hate it, on the contrary I liked it. However I can't give a movie a higher score in which half of it I could barely understand, has characters that felt more generic than almost any anime character I've seen before, and the fact that I literally had to pause the movie and walk away from it for about 5 minutes just to process what was happening and how it happened. Kimi no Na wa is good, but boy is it hard to follow.",5,TheNCSmaster316
32281,"
                I finally saw this highly anticipated release. While the Art is superb and pretty much unmatched, 5 Centimeters per Second is overall better than this one.
I went in thinking it was going to be absolutely amazing, that nothing could top this film for a few years and then some. From its exuberant intro sequence and song, I could tell that this was NOT going to pluck my heartstrings the way that 5 Centimeters per Second did - and I was correct.
I'm a huge anime and video game OST fan and after the intro, I was hoping for a recurring melody that I was so fond
                  of when I watched 5 Centimeters per Second but I found little to no value in the music.
I also became confused during the film and there was a point where I had to go back. This is not a good. To make matters worse, I felt disappointed when it finally ended.
Final thought: The film definitely did not resonate with me nor its characters. There was nothing terribly extraordinary about them and I will say the same about the story. If you're like me, go in and expect some incredible visuals where no two scenes look the same. I can only imagine how much it all cost. Sadly, that's the absolute best thing the film has going for it. Boy, I would have been VERY disappointed if I had paid over $100 USD for a special edition.",6,SpoonyBoogy

                Anime movies in the West have never been the biggest hits. Aside from Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli’s works, having a truly successful anime-styled film outside of Japan is notable rare, especially for one not linked to a famous TV anime. However, despite these known factors, the smash hit Your Name appeared onto the scene in 2016, reaching record success among even non-anime watchers, acclaimed for its incredible animation and beautiful story. 
And what a story it is. Telling the tale of a boy and girl separated by space as they switch bodies and attempt to live their lives, Your Name is all at once a
                  comedic, heartfelt, and deeply emotional experience that truly must be viewed to understand. While the narrative itself is rather simple, the way it’s conveyed and told is beyond enthralling as you witness a grand story unfolding itself before your very eyes in ways you might never imagine, ways that could never be done by any live-action movie. 
That aspect is a key one of Your Name’s strengths; namely the sheer power behind its animation. In terms of beautiful landscapes and imagery, this film set a precedent that every anime film since has strived to attain. Every shot is stunning, every character on-model and full of life, every environment vibrantly alive. It’s simply a wondrous thing to watch, something that also goes beyond words if I were to be honest.
Something far more explainable is the strength of the characters in the movie. Each and everyone is not only (as discussed) wonderfully animated full of life and personality, but is distinctly real in their actions and decisions, feeling completely like any people in our world would. Even throughout the absurd premise of the movie, somehow the main characters’ central traits feel very defined, and their responses very realistic (sometimes a bit too realistic). It really feels just like peering into another world rather than an animated film.
And a vital part of making the world feel whole is the wonderfully composed soundtrack that pairs with the film. Performed by the band RADWIMPS, the movie’s music is equal parts, chipper, beautiful, and heartbreaking, covering every base to fit whatever scene it’s in perfectly. There are even a few voiced tracks that are played at certain, very important scenes in the movie to exemplify their difference. I don’t think I’ve ever felt such a closely integrated movie soundtrack before or since, and it adds so much to the experience.
In conclusion, Your Name is a truly wondrous, beautiful film that, try as I might, I simply can’t describe it entirely in words. It’s something that I think really must be experienced for oneself, and is something I think every person should try and watch at least once. Everything from its narrative, to the animation, to the character, to the incredible music is simply honed to near perfection, making a film I don’t find much personal fault in. Really, it’s nothing more or less than a breathtaking view.

For me it was a first of its kind. Really liked the artstyle I used to think i wouldnt enjoy romantc animes but this one really moved me(i usually like action or horror). The story really held me at the edge of my seat. For most of its duration i wasnt sure what the point was. When i saw the scene where they finnaly met and wrote ""their names"" on eachothers hands i started bawling. Only plot hole that i saw was the thing where their texts started disapearing.

                This is the first anime movie I have ever watched, and today, 4 years later, I finally rewatched it and had to write a review. Rewatching it really confirmed that this is, in fact, my favorite movie of all time.
Watching it 4 years ago with basically no experience with anime, and today after so many years of anime and movies are completely different experiences, and I will describe both.
4 YEARS AGO
---
Knowing pretty much nothing about anime and Japanese culture, the movie remained puzzling from the beginning to the very end. I made so many assumptions about the story, missed so many details, but I was
                  still somehow on a rollercoaster of emotions and events the movie sped through. 
I enjoy watching movies, and at the time, I was consuming unhealthy amounts every single day. Nevertheless, watching Kimi No Na Wa was a completely new experience that simply blew my mind. I had many questions after watching it and continued thinking about it for weeks. During that time I downloaded Sparkle and Nandemonaiya and listened to them on repeat every day on the way to school. I was in high school at the time, and I kept pondering on the thought that I will never find my soulmate, even if they existed. 
Even though so many things happen in the movie, I still made some sense of it and found it a beautiful mesh of unknown with breathtaking visuals and soul-stirring music. I had no idea what any of the lyrics meant (I don't think they were translated in the sub at the time), but listening to them, I was able to visualize the scenes when they played and experience the complex emotions all over again. 
Bear in mind that I had basically seen no anime at this point (except some shows as a kid, like DBZ, Yu Gi Oh, etc.), so I had nothing to compare it to. I could only compare it to the countless western movies I had seen, and yet it was so far ahead in letting me experience the most profound emotions I never even thought I could feel watching a movie. And I am not talking about misery or bliss; I am talking about all the emotions in between, like merriment and disquiet, purified or mixed together, amplified to the maximum. All the components of the movie contributed to the myriad of emotions and impressions that kept lingering for weeks on end.
TODAY
---
Today, a familiar story suddenly became so clear and complete. Having experienced so much anime, being familiar with Japanese culture and folklore, knowing some Japanese, and knowing the soundtracks and their translations by heart, watching Kimi No Na Wa was like watching your own child who is a piano prodigy take the stage and win over the hearts of every single person in the audience, the one with the most trained ears and the one deaf to all the intricacies. I was most certainly deaf watching it 4 years ago.
4 years ago, the story that spoke to the high school me made me cry with content and relief. Today, the college me was able to laugh at all these details that reminded me of the high school me, and how far I came, and how much I grew. The soundtracks spoke to the current and future me and let me experience the heartfelt tears of content once again. 
GENERAL
---
I love the way the story is told in this movie. It's fast-paced and unclear; it jumps around in chaos that very much resembles the complexity of time and relationships. We don't have an opportunity to meet these two characters thoroughly, and yet we learn so much about them without being explicitly told pretty much anything. But at the end of the day, they are left to our interpretation. They are just two teenagers living two different lives in two completely different places and even different timelines. This movie touches upon so many topics but never in an overbearing way. What does a girl from a small town think about every day? How does a boy from a big city spend his time? How do these teenagers with no experience express love? How do they express any emotion? How do they hide it? In your perfectly routine life, how does a person make an entrance? How many times can we miss an opportunity before it's too late? Is fate really set in stone? Do you really know what you want and what you're looking for? 
One scene towards the end of the movie touched me every time because it's so beautifully immature and pure. It's something so simple and expected, but it's so fitting, so apt. That's where the essence of this movie lies.
The characterization and the story are embraced by the visuals and the soundtracks that lightly breeze through this complex spiel and gently tickle soul and mind leaving a true feeling of liberation. The lightness of this movie can never be overbearing and the potency of its rawness is intoxicating. It remains my favorite movie of all time. Not for a groundbreaking, earth-shattering plot, not for superb animation that challenges time and technology, and not for never-before-heard glorious soundtracks and lyrics. It's for all these things that are so well done, and slightly more than that, that this movie surpasses all the others I have ever seen.",10,Yoru-chin

                overall the anime is great!! 
I will mention where the points were taken out of 10.
Story: great! one point was taken off for the communication process between Mitsuha and Taki, the phones using and the time erasing .. 
Art: it is fantastic, however when I compared it to other peace of art anime like Attack on titan, I gave it 8. From my point of view.
Sound: really good, tow points were taken off for the background effects. somehow they could emphasized the background effect and voices more, like students talking at the school, trees' leafs sounds with air, the river ... etc .. it was
                  really good .. but some anime put more effort on this.
characters: the personalities were written really well, I liked how they included the emotional reactions in the story, one point was taken off for many secondary reasons.
the story of the movie was focusing on the 2 main characters, so my evaluation built on that.
enjoyment: it is really enjoyable, the first third is good, the rest tow thirds were excellent.
overall : 9 ^_^",9,Yazan_Maswadeh

                Your Name is a romance drama with a mild fantasy element that explores gender roles, traditional vs modern Japan, and what it means to share a connection with someone. It starts this journey through the body swap mechanic. Taki and Mitsuha switch bodies for a day when they go to sleep a few times a week. They initially think it is a dream but then realize they are connected to another person. This motif of a dream becomes an important theme throughout. (Mild spoilers)
	The first part concerns itself with the daily lives they go through in the process of falling in love. They attempt to
                  communicate with each other and establish some ground rules (which Taki often subverts in comedic moments of self-touching in Mitsuha’s body). Mitsuha is naturally very timid, and Taki is quick to anger. Swapping bodies gradually changes them, as Mitsuha becomes more assertive and Taki more gentle. Connecting with another person has made them better people. The ending of the first part comes at the moment it is clearly indicated that they have fallen in love. This is arguably also the weakest part of the movie, as the previous daily life scenes didn’t build up any romance between the two. It does, however, show the contrast between their lives well. Mitsuha feels trapped in her traditional role as a shrine maiden for her family, and the youth feel discontent at the lack of entertainment, development, and opportunity. Meanwhile, Taki struggles with juggling both work and school in a single parent household in Tokyo. The grass is always greener on the other side, but both ultimately want to return to their own lives too.
	The middle concerns their search for each other after they can no longer swap. Here we see how much the swap has influenced Taki, as he has become good at drawing architecture from his memories of Mitsuha’s town. Their memories of each other are fading, much like waking up from a dream. There comes a climactic moment when Taki realizes that it is impossible for them to meet, and it is accompanied by a frightening loss of memory. His desperation to save those memories and his will to go on despite losing them show the depth of his feelings. Beautiful landscapes accompany some of the emotional scenes in this part, and Radwimps really got the feel down with their country-ish rock songs. Taki finally takes drastic action to reconnect, and the connection of the history of a certain event and the family of shrine maidens is made clear in a brilliant “aha!” moment.
	In the final part, Taki tries one last time to save Mitsuha from her fate. It’s interesting to see the interactions between the side characters here, but the main highlight of the “saving” act is when Taki and Mitsuha meet. A certain act in the past is revealed, and everything ties together in a beautiful emotional moment that fades from their memory like a dream. After the crisis, everyone moves on with their lives, not remembering the other or what happened, but still holding onto their feelings such that they search for the other. By this point, I sympathize greatly with Taki and Mitsuha’s tension every time they pass by each other. They are always just missing each other and afraid to connect. They don’t even remember each other’s names. Shinkai pulls off a wonderful ending at the staircase that shows the depth of their bond despite losing their memories, an ending that truly embodies “Your Name.”
	The greatest strengths of this movie, besides its spectacular visuals and music, is in its characters. They feel like real, flawed people with hopes and dreams. I even sympathized with the side characters like Takashi. The one shot inside of his room following conversations with Sayaka and his dad encapsulated exactly what future he wanted and how he probably felt. The movie builds sympathy for the main characters early on with them trying to deal with their daily realities. Mitsuha strives to be a modern girl in Tokyo but still deals with her family duties as a shrine maiden. Taki has a crush on Ms. Ogudera at first, but it seems to him an unrequited love, and he shows up to work at the same place as her despite his awkwardness. When combined with the dramatic efforts in the later parts, the connection to not only the characters but their lives and environment is firmly established. The one weakness was the rather flimsy process of falling in love. All in all, Your Name is a masterpiece just shy of flawlessness.",9,Zechrx

                I don't know what it was about this movie, but I could watch it five million more times and still love it. The soundtrack is beautiful, the art is beautiful, the story is beautiful, the characters are beautiful...the entire thing is a masterpiece. 
In fact, I've shown this movie to several people who all walk away from it with the same overwhelming feelings as me. It is simply perfect, from the beginning, to the plot twist, to the bittersweet ending. Flawless execution. 
The two MCs have an amazing chemistry, despite never meeting physically until the end...and even then there's a spin on it. But of
                  course they get to know each other through literally living through each other. What better way to fall in love? 
In the beginning, you'll laugh. You'll shake your head and roll your eyes. You'll scoff at some of the behaviors. In the middle, you'll be on the edge of your seat. You'll cry. You'll find the history and the scenery fascinating. And at the end, you'll feel complete. It's one of those movies you think about days, weeks, even years after originally watching it.

                I heard a lot of good review about this movie. After a long moment, i finally watch it. I dont have the same opinion compared to the others. The movie is good, I will not deny it, but for me it's not perfect.
Firstly, the story, i like it, the effect of two chars able to switch their body, i enjoy it. Unfortunately, i prefered that in the first part, I hoped for it to be longer, even if i had some difficulties to know if they were really them or not. For the second part, wasn't really what i liked because this is not what
                  i wanted to see in this movie, i'm not a big fan of Journey and science fiction elements
For the artstule, I see that they'""re made to be for a movie which is nice, but I didn't really like the character design, while we talk about the chars, the past of the girl is interesting, the hero's one no
For the sound, i agree that the musics are linked to the anime but unfortunately, i didn't like them

                I don't like this movie.
Kimi no na wa is outstanding in terms of animation, but that's my problem, because for this movie is more important animating as outstanding as possible so people go ''wow, that looks very realistic'' every 5 minutes... but it doesn't add more than that in terms of creativity.
This movie could have been a live action movie, and it would be mediocre at it's best, like, literally you could have the same script, the same music, all of it is very poor, literally the only thing that saves this movie (kinda) is it's animation, and JUST BECAUSE they did it very realistic...
                  like, why, what was the point? there's no reason for this to be an animated movie because it does not matter, the animation doesn't add anything important to the movie, like exaggerated faces or different colors so that we could feel more, it doesn't have that spark, this movie is just empty.",6,SuperDorio

                The story of Kimi no Na wa is really unique, and the animation is amazing. Shinkai did a great job of balancing shadows ith bright pictures, as most anime movies are either too dark or too bright. Radwimps did an amazing job of adding the music, and it really enhanced the movie. The main characters, in the beginning, were rather vanilla (IN MY OPINION!), but was as the story progressed and I got to know the main characters more, I began to enjoy the story. Overall, Kimi no Na wa is a great movie, and everyone who likes anime, slice of life, and a little
                  fantasy should watch this movie.",9,brandonchangsan

                Yet another masterpiece from Makoto Shinkai.
By the time Kimi no Na wa reaches its final half-hour or so, the film has moved so far beyond its initial premise that if you think back to the beginning, you'll be astonished by how far it's come. This movie manages to paint an insanely broad stroke of appeal without being convenient or contrive which is no small feat. Working as a highschool romance, escapist fantasy and a multilayered sci fi. It even utilizes cityboy smalltown girl archetypes to it's advantage. It actually starts off rather unimpressively with its seemingly arbitrary freaky-friday premise, lighthearted teen romanticism and arguably sexist
                  overtones... but when it begins to find a dramatic stage the story quickly races into suspense as pieces of the puzzle fall into place. As with any Anime romance it clashes not once but twice with substantial melodramatic overtures but it's never a cheap feeling.",9,HMomori

Your Name is just a good movie. This movie felt long, but not too long. All the way through, I was asking what would happen next. It was clever, emotional, and left me crying after the movie. The twist was done really well, and I almost wanted to pause the movie. Also, the animation is gorgeous. You get to see detailed images from many angles and perspectives, and there were hundreds of animators! The credits didn't start out with the cast like it usually would. The first thing you saw after a black screen was hundreds of names
                  of animators and designers. I watched this movie 14 times  and I still felt my muscles ready to let tears out. I would not recommend this movie any less than the next guy, so what are you waiting for? Get a couple of friends and watch Your Name!",9,Anime_lover_2004

[STORY] I really love how complex the story was, but didn't go off the road. They didn't put many arc, just one story, but they did spread pieces and mystery all over the places. The build up was just so perfect. We get to see each of their lives. Only there were a couple of unnecessary comedy they put in there. There were moments where it can play with our emotions even more but they decided to go for a comedy. Anyway, they build the story with a normal pace with many stuff in it, BUT they did it
                  neatly and that's very amazing. The dialogs, the explanations of each pieces are brilliant. If you still don't understand it, there's something wrong with your brain. And also the way they included Japanese culture as the center of the story, they did it perfectly. In the end, it's all about ritual.
[ART] I don't have to talk too much. The animation has no competitor. It's simply a masterpiece. I've lost words.
[SOUND] The voice actors deserved awards. The way they talk, distinguish when they need to become female, or when they need to become male, I have no idea how they did that. The scoring of this movie was just PERFECT!! I don't know how to describe it. Also.. THE OST ARE JUST INCREDIBLE!!! Holy cow once again I've lost words.
[CHARACTER] Here's our problem.. The characters are good, but Taki's character was the one I have problem with. Why? We don't know how Taki truly is. He doesn't have a true characteristic. Okudera said he's a short temper. But as Taki, we didn't see how it played out with him. We didn't see that kind of characteristic. We didn't get any ""true Taki"". It felt really different when Taki became Mitsuha and when he's himself. He was so active as Mitsuha, but so passive as himself.",10,noe9

Dokidoki: 6/10 (There aren't much ""sweet"" scenes if you're looking for one but there are some by the end. You'll understand why it was a bit difficult at first to see the dokidoki)
Unique: 8/10 (Time travelling and switching bodies are quite common, but it was uniquely used here)
Story line: 9/10 (It's a difficult story to come up. Common concepts were involved like switching bodies yet it was used in an interesting way.)
Ending: 9/10 (If yo' a cry babeh, then yo' gon' cry mate)
Feels meter: 6/10 (Hushh)
Art: It wasn't done in a half-assed way. Animators drew every frame needed and it was good. Felt like the ritual that Mitsuho and Yatsuho did really was how it was supposed to be. Watch in HD to ""feel"" it more (ahhn~ kimochi!! moto~ moto~!!)

                Your Name is a movie that I wasn't entirely sure of when I heard about it, but after my brother raved about it, I had to give it a try.
Story & Characters: Your Name starts us out with Mitsuha, who lives in a very remote town, far away from any city.  She has a bit of a mundane life and wishes to someday move to Tokyo where she feels she'd enjoy the big city much more.  She wakes up one day with her friends telling her that she seemed a bit ""off"" the previous day.  She has no memory of this, but
                  carries on with her day.  After another day, she awakens and gets her wish - she's in a big city.  But there's a catch: She's in a boy's body who she doesn't even know.  She later learns that his name is Taki, and through the course of the film, they continue to switch bodies at random intervals and go about each other's daily lives.  They do things like keep logs and notes to each other after the swap in order to set some rules until they figure out why it's happening, which motivates them to try and meet each other in person.
While Mitsuha yearns to live in the city, Taki, seems very content with the laid back life he's got while going about the same thing, day after day.  When Mitsuha decides to play around with his life a little, you can see how uncomfortable he gets, and while not all of it leads to an undesired result, he doesn't seem to appreciate it.  The desire to meet each other does seem to be fueled by nothing more than curiosity, but the story does a decent job at showing how these two characters want to meet each other, despite the very odd interactions they have.  Mitsuha and Taki on their own aren't terribly deep characters, but the back end of the movie does an excellent job at portraying what they want to do with life - or what they don't.  They have their own struggles and goals and while they may feel very simple to some, I feel like it was just enough.
Our side characters, however, bring much more fun to the story than I was expecting.  Taki's coworker, Ms. Okudera, is probably the dullest of the group, but still fine as she gets more involved in the later stages of the story.  Mitsuha's friends Sayaka and Katsuhiko are fantastic, both being exciting and ready to believe everything that's going on in Mitsuha's little world.  They're a great compliment, especially in the back end of the story.  So while the characters as a whole aren't anything exceptional, I'd argue the story is what keeps them in a solid spot.
The beginning third of the movie does a wonderful job at having some fun with us at our character's expense and it keeps the movie very lighthearted.  The obviously things that come to mind are when a female swaps bodies with a male - use your imagination.  It sets an amazing stage for the movie.  I'd argue the middle does drag a bit in that showing the daily lives of our characters can only be exciting for so long, however, it still transitions the movie from being all about being fun, to starting to figure out how and why the swaps have been happening.  The ending third of the movie ties everything together quite nicely, especially when we start to realize how everything pieces together nicely.  Obviously, the similarities in the story to Weathering With You will turn some people away, but Your Name is still a wonderfully told story.  (Story: 9/10, Characters: 7/10)
Art: Your Name looks really solid, especially in the scenes that we start to see the colours pop.  It never goes above and beyond what we expect from a modern anime movie, but there weren't really any blemishes to speak of.  (8/10)
Sound: RADWIMPS does the bulk of the music throughout the movie and if it's one criticism I can give, it's that it all feels a touch too similar at times.  Don't get me wrong, it sounds great, but mixing it up just a touch more would have been nice.  As far as the VO cast goes, they were very strong from top to bottom.  Michael Sinterniklaas (Taki) isn't someone I hear a lot these days and though he's probably the weakest of the group, he still does a fine job.  Stephanie Sheh (Mitsuha) and Cassandra Lee Morris (Sayaka) were definitely the strongest, two VOs I wish I heard more of these days - but I might just be a sucker for some of the VOs that have been around a long time.  (9/10)
Overall Enjoyment: Your Name's story really pulled me in and takes on different tones to satisfy different audiences, with very strong transitions as we move through this film.  Piecing everything together at the end makes for an is incredible watch, even if the middle was a little more mellow than I would have liked.  I wouldn't say the characters were anything terribly special, but everything else easily made up for it.  Your Name is easily worth the 90 minute watch.  (9/10)",9,Justykanna

The hype revolving around this animated film is so suffocating that it somehow convinced me to fight the LA traffic to go see it in a cramped, artsy film theater with 40ish loud anime fans and a snobby french couple next to me. Was it worth all this trouble?
Plot: 4.5/10
I'm going to separate this spoiler comment bellow from the rest of the review. If you do not want to be spoiled then just gloss over the next paragraph.
SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER If you have seen the lackluster
                  Hollywood film The Lake House and the anime Kokoro Connect then you have an idea how the main plot mechanic works in this film. How this mechanic of switching bodies affects the film is pretty fun to see but it is by no means a new idea. Keep in mind that I liked this mechanic but I hate how we see this only really play out for the female MC in the beginning; you see almost no scenes where the male MC is in control of the female MC's body at her school which was disappointing. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER
Ok so with that out of the way I have to say that the film does its job of keeping you involved with what is going on. The problem though is that the film is heavily relying on the SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER “Wait...I'm a boy!!!?? Wait...I'm a girl!!!??” SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER gag throughout the entire film. This is funny the first couple of times it shows up but after awhile it starts to lose its charm. The way they brought the ending of the film together was cool and cute but overall you are watching this film for the animation/art and the character interactions.
Animation: 10/10
This absolutely lived up to the hype. I'm not quite sure how much of the film is traditional hand-drawn animation but my god the movement of the characters and the quality of the background scenes are absolutely orgasmic. Both the countryside and Tokyo are so full of color and detail. The character models are also very appealing; not in an overally sexual way but in a tasteful attractive way (I mean come on the MCs are still teenagers).
Sound: 10/10
A surprise standout feature for this film; they nailed the acoustic qualities. The music was very fitting (there are 3 or so moments where there is only music and panning shots) and the voice actors nailed their characters especially in the parts where what was mentioned above in the spoiler section takes place.
Characters: 6.5/10
So...yeah this is tough to put into words. The characters are interesting and they do provide lots of really funny moments together (this includes the female MC's friends who play a big part in the ending) but I cannot help but feel that they seem...not fleshed out? I left the film with very little knowledge of both the male and female MC's personalities. We see the gag play out with the spoiler mentioned plot device up above but that didn't completely tell us how these MC's normally act, what their desires are, ext.
Overall I really digged the interactions between all the characters but I felt like possible character development was severely lost.
Overall: 7.8/10
With something this hyped up it will never live up to everyone's expectations. In my case, it didn't but I did enjoy the film. The slapstick and awkward humor hit their marks, the interactions between characters was on the mark, and the sound and visual design was immaculate. I wished that they took the time to develop the main characters and possibly show us some more material after where the movie left off but I guess that is left up to us to imagine. It is not a perfect film but it is by no means bad; this is a very good watch. I recommend you go see this in theaters if you get the chance since it is such a visual spectacle. It's a super cute, visually and acoustically stunning film; nothing more.

                Opening – General Statement 
This review was written after a first watch. I heard very little about “Kimi no Na wa” (“your name” – from this point forward, I going to call this movie “Your Name” to simplify things)” before watching the movie and am gland that I did before it was a fun and good watch.
As all ways am not going to give any spoilers in this review and off course it is my opinion. if you have not watched this movie yet go watch it, you will enjoy it.
Summary of review Structure
I going to break down this review into serval parts, these parts
                  will be Opening – General Statement, summary of review structure, story, characters – main character, character – side characters, Art, sound – music, sound – General sound design, enjoyability and conclusion – overall opinion.
Story
I was surprised, I thought at first it was a dream plot but instead it was about body switching. I was much happier that “Your Name” decided to go this direction. 
The story is about a very emotional Tachibana, Taki trying to save Miyamizu, Mitsuha from an event that will affect her friends, her family and her. 
Tachibana and mitsuha swiched body when they go to sleep and then swich back the next day. this is the start of their romance as the character slowly start to learn how they live their very different lives the audience also learns about the characters. This allows the audience to get to know and start to form a connection with these characters. 
I can’t say any more about “Your Name” without giving spoilers. All I can say Is the plot is an emotional ride that got me hooked to the story.
I am going to rate the story a 10 of 10. 
Characters – Main character
As I said above. The romance between Tachibana and Mitsuha slowly developed throughout the movie. 
I am going rate the main characters a 10 out 10.
Character – Side Characters.
I going to start off with, what I felt was the more boring side characters.
The characters that are in Tachibana life; Okudera Miki, Fuji Tsukasa and Takagi Shinta.
These characters are given less time in the movie and this shows in a negative way. They are friends with Tachibana and go with him to meet Mitsuha.
The characters that are in Mitsuha’s life; Miyamizu Yotsuha, Miyamizu Hitocha, Teshigawara Katsuhiko and Natori Sayaka.
I would rate the Side characters an 8 out 10 – just the side characters in Tachibana brings It down a bit. But I say the main characters more than make up for it.
 Art, Sound – Music, Sound – General Sound Design.
I decided to put all three of these sections together in this essay, but I can’t really comment on any section in great detail without giving any spoilers – nor should I.
Art is a 10 out 10 before it’s just beautiful, but now you have probably see the image of then meteor because its everywhere. That is just one of many beautiful bits in “Your Name”. 
Sound- Music and General Sound Design is a 10 out 10, it is just perfect. If I had to give any music that is top level is the music at the OP and the ED . 
Enjoyability
It can be safe to say that I enjoyed this movie, I think the reason that I enjoyed this movie so much is because I heard very little about “Your Name”, I just seen it on a few lists and on Netflix and decided to watch it.
conclusion – overall opinion.
From everything I said in this essay (review) I have to rate “Your Name” 10 out 10.",10,thespacegun

But that friggen ending… I have and will continue to have a love-hate relationship with the ending of this film until Shinkai Makoto decides he’ll do a friggen OVA or something just to see Mitsuha and Taki finally having a face to face, sit down conversation about everything that happened and who they are now WITHOUT the threat of an impending meteor, or the time constraints of twilight, or the threat of losing their memories of each other… IN THEIR OWN DAMN BODIES!!!

Only faint fragments remain, the missing piece of your life interweaved across past and future, converging and shaping the flow of time. These threads twist, tangle, sometimes unravel, break and then connect again. Across boundless distances and insurmountable odds, you will never stop searching for that something or someone.

                  changed my life forever. It fundamentally changed my perspective on the cinematic landscape, the power of animation and the nature of love itself. It serves as a grand culmination of Shinkai's entire filmography so far, a grandiose romance tale that soars for astonishing emotional and dramatic heights. It is a breathtaking spectacle, an emotional triumph, a flawless masterpiece and my favourite movie of all time. 
Makoto Shinkai's entire career has been consumed with the nature of love and connection. His work is a constant exploration of how longing and separation impact our very essence, contextualised through the struggles of young lovers. Whether it be the melancholic realism of 5 Centimeters per Second or the boundless connection of The Garden of Words, these trademark themes permeate his every work and manifest themselves in diverse and unique ways each time. In this regard, Your Name is Shinkai's most complete work, a reflection on love, fate and connection but expressed in a story of monumental scale and fantastical imagination. 
The originality and complexity of the screenplay are masterful; a body-swapping romance combined with sci-fi/fantastical elements. It is a wildly ambitious and passionate work filled with an ingenious blend of heart, humour and spectacle whose cohesiveness and elegance is shocking beyond belief. Despite the sophisticated structure, the film never fails to be heartfelt and emotionally resonant. Shinkai guides us into the world of the characters with such warmth and heart, presenting the world in such dazzling landscapes, a breathtaking splendour of creativity and realism. RADWIMPS' score is both a musical and lyrical masterwork, immensely evocative and flawlessly elevating every single moment with exquisite and graceful style. The gorgeous visuals and technical wonder present here are astounding, as the style and substance explode on to the screen. 
Despite its vast and melodramatic nature, the romance never feels fabricated as the bond between these star-crossed lovers constantly feels authentic and genuine. Mitsuha and Taki are nothing more than teenagers, who for whatever reason have been given an extraordinary opportunity to experience what it means to live as the other. Even if the two were always fated to be together as symbolised by the red string of fate, it is no wonder that they still would have fallen in love nonetheless. When you experience what it means to be someone else, you appreciate and understand them on a far deeper level than ever possible. You find the beauty in their life that they may simply take for granted and come to emphasise with them. There is no love story more beautiful or genuine than Mitsuha and Taki. It may seem so monumental in scale but the core is simple: falling in love with the entirety of someone, their flaws and insecurities as well as their beauty and soul. 
After a mindblowing and earth-shattering midpoint twist, the story shifts into an exhilarating and heart-pounding second half, where the momentum builds and builds in an emotional rollercoaster of unparalleled heights. It achieves something truly glorious where everything that has been set up, pays off in the most satisfying way possible. It is so relieving but also so heart-wrenching, perfectly balancing a myriad of emotions with such elegant precision. Such love and affection pour through every moment and when those final moments come, the longing in your heart has been undoubtedly fulfilled. This is explosive and bold filmmaking, the pinnacle of cinematic experiences and what firmly established Shinkai as a master of his craft.
Your Name radiates an everlasting warmth and emotional power, standing as the most important film of my entire lifetime. It is an unforgettable experience that I continue to love and admire even more on every viewing. It is the most beautiful work of art ever made, an outstanding storytelling achievement, a visual masterstroke and my favourite film ever made. It will continue to endure, continue to evolve and remain something that will never fail to make me believe in the power of love, the poetic beauty of life and the happiness that awaits us.",10,Yo-chanM

                Sometimes I make long reviews, sometimes I make short reviews, either way I hope that this at least motivates one person to share this experience.
I started watching anime almost a year ago, so I'm a little late to the party.
In 2016, Makoto Shinkai made the huge hit on the anime industry, the moment when 'your name.' came out, the moment Makoto Shinkai changed everything, the moment I learned how to stop carrying about a “what if” and just started loving pieces of entertainment such as, the way I see this movie, a piece of art. I want to say right off the bat that your
                  name deserves all the fame that it got, from the amazing animation to the incredible soundtrack that contrasts perfectly all the elements of this movie. Makoto Shinkai took all of his strengths and refined them to make his magnum opus, where he delivered a story that it's still talked about until this day and we will never forget. For me the first scene that opens with an intern monologue between our main characters, Taki and Mitsuha, followed with a song by the band that made the entire soundtrack (RADWIMPS) that still amazes me in every way. I absolutely love the chemistry between our main characters and how they got to know each other by changing bodies. It is a typical love story, but it's also so much more. It delivers an amazing setting with its animation that still stands out to this day. You can laugh and cry watching this movie because not only it feels genuine, but it feels real, it feels like a real love story that keeps unfolding in a conceptual but easy to understand way with a story that evolves around ideas that blend together as the movie keeps going. Everything that this movie has to offer makes you glue you to your seat because it’s a feast for your eyes, and a delight to your heart, because the joy and happiness that I felt, as well as the sadness and woe, can only be felt with this particular movie, a masterpiece that gets everything right in my opinion. 
Makoto said: “I finished this movie 4 days ago” after its release, and I totally believe it, not because it felt rushed, but because there is nothing left for him to do in order to improve this movie in any way.

Story: 8
I rate the story 8 because its plot is already ""overused"" considering the craze for nice and high rated animes at the moment. The story is still unique though as I myself enjoyed its originality and style. The story and plot really makes you say, ""As expected of Makoto Shinkai..."" in a good way.
Art: 10
The art is obviously 10, just by looking at the poster and trailers, its just obviously 10. The details are superb and nice.
Sound: 8
Although the soundtrack is nice, it didn't make a long lasting impression for me. The soundtrack is, like, ""common"", if I would describe it based on my opinion. The score would have been 10 if it was unique enough that I could recognize what movie it was from just by hearing it.
Character: 10
I rated the character 10 because the movie really used its time to show and emphasize each main and side characters. The character development is perfect for the kind of movie it is.

                Overall a beautiful and entertaining movie, but simply unnecessarily confusing. 
My main gripe was the intro, where when the body swap happens, it is not explicitly stated. That's fine, since show not tell is a good thing. But the reaction to the body swap was really bad, unlike a normal person, who would obviously scream and react that they literally lost their physical body and are a different person, the characters just went about their day as usual. They went to school, went to work, and just acted like a person, with a bit of amnesia. This was really ambiguous and honestly frustrating to watch,
                  since there is no explanation of what the event is it is very difficult to connect to the story.
The plot twist is good, but again with the lack of both showing and telling, it makes the story too confusing to be absorbed. Mystery is good, but I missed many key elements of the movie because I was unsure of what time or place I was watching, and what the supernatural elements were, such as parallel universes, time travel, the astral plane, etc. Knowing these would be essential to the story.
Regardless, the movie was entertaining and comedic, and the romance was decently moving.
Story 3/10
Art 10/10
Sound 9/10
Character 7/10, The characters were realistic and entertaining, but not outstanding.
Enjoyment 7/10 The movie was funny, suspenseful, and moving. The animation was eye-catching and sound design was poignant. 
Overall 7/10, The movie would be 10/10 if it was less confusing. An example of mystery done right would be Parasite, which gives you the premise clearly (A family assimilating into another family) but leaves out the dramatic details, so you can be engaged, but also wondering. Here, I struggled to see the premise, whether it was body swap, amnesia, astral plane, etc., which in turn prevented me from absorbing the story.",7,PlasmaAndroid

                Been a fan of Makoto Shinkai ever since I watched Byousoku 5 Centimeter at Crunchyroll. This was a time when Crunchyroll was a free site. I can never forget how One More Time, One More Chance was playing in the background while 5 cm per Second reached its climax. I can list several reasons why Makoto Shinkai's movie are well received.  The most noticeable point of his movies is that the art style, specifically the vibrant crisp color pallets, is always a stunning view to see. It really makes your eyes stick to your screen like Elmer's glue on your preschool popsicle project for
                  art class. In addition to the good visuals are the well formulated stories that appeals to the viewers emotion by giving a sense of nostalgic feeling that clings on realism that it could happen in a real world setting but far fetched enough to be deemed as what would occur in a fantasy world. Sounds is good but at least for me I still prefer tracks from Studio Ghibli or something like what you would hear from Wolf Children. Putting the long introduction aside, what I like about Kimi No Na wa is that it held through what makes Makoto Shinkai... Makoto Shinkai. Whats different about this movie from his others is that this one tilts more on a fantasy setting with the whole body swapping mechanics which in the end I wish they explained more of. Despite of it though, it still gave me the feelings I got from when I watched his past movies. A feeling of ""ahhhhhhhhh what if this happend to me?"" or ""I wonder how (insert name of past important person whom you lost connection with) is doing"". One thing I'm torn about this movie is how it ended. If you have watched 5cm and Garden of Words then for sure you will be having a fresh experience with this one. The first two finished with a feeling of nostalgic regret  that it makes you more immersed. As to why is for you to find out :) Treat it as a mini game when watching the movie.

Just watch the movie if you want to have that Disney and Ghibli films feels like it was your first",9,Weeaboogaloo

                The animation may sound confusing or complicated for people who are turned off by shifting scenes and switching screen time. But in any case, it is more a beautiful Japanese production that deserves to be watched and contemplated by all lovers of cinema.
The box office records were not for nothing. It's one of the best-produced animations of recent times. Both the audio and the visuals are incredible.
Speaking separately, the soundtrack is far, but far above average compared to even the greatest movies with greater power than Kimi No Na Wa.
Speaking of the characters, the protagonists can trap the viewer from start to finish. Super captivating
                  and sincere throughout the plot. The more secondary, do not leave to be desired. They hold the ends even without so much highlight and glow on the screen.
The story - as mentioned above - may develop somewhat confused on the part of the most unsuspecting, but nothing that compromises the plot. Well tied from start to finish, Makoto Shinkai does not leave loose ends and everything is basically finished. We have a show of affection, fondness and the creation of bonds of a very honest and without error form with the protagonists.
A mention that I think is not so debated about others but that has gained great prominence with me and that I need to comment, is about the Japanese trip that the film offers us. It is a delicate, extreme and romantic view of the country of origin of the animation under a sensational quality. Also worth mentioning is the small demonstrations that the film gives us of how the culture of Japan works in small sections.",9,Hygor_DDL

                When I first came across this anime, I brushed it off as generic and never thought twice about it. After watching it for the first time, my mind was changed completely, but looking back I'm not sure that it really should have been. Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie, but I'm not sure that it really deserved to hold the title of best-selling anime movie of all time over contenders like Ghibli's all-time best for as long as it did (granted, I still think it deserves it over Mugen Train which is a movie that I think is objectively better so I
                  don't know what to think of my rankings anymore).
First, this is easily the most beautiful Japanimation film I've ever seen both visually and audibly, and I don't think anything will ever top it in that department. The Kuchikamizake Trip is one of the single most stunning scenes to ever appear in cinema, and the rest of the movie only barely trails behind. RADWIMPS were really the only people cut out for this movie's soundtrack, and every song is instantly memorisable.
Where this movie loses its points, though, is in its enjoyability during the first act. While the sudden plot beats get the viewer immediately captivated, it somewhat peters off to focus on some of the most boring parts of Taki and Mitsuha's lives possible. Thankfully, once the movie sets itself free from the depression of quality, everything from the twist in the second act to the ending is spectacular.
While I think this movie has earned a nine or even a ten, I think that its overwhelming quality four fifths of the time makes the weak fifth that much more inexcusable. Overall, though, this is a movie that I think anyone who likes anime should see at one point or another. It might not be my choice for the best, but it's certainly up there as one of the prettiest.",8,TwistedTempest23

                I couldn't say that it's the perfect anime, but it's pretty damn close. The absolutely mind blowing story that this movie presented is handled in a way that even though you don't feel particularly sad, you still feel emotions. Just emotions. You don't exactly know why you feel this way. You just do. The characters don't feel cartoony. You feel like they're actually real, as are the people around them. The scenery is just... gorgeous. The sheer beauty and detail put into everything around  the characters is just....absurd. The music was great. Each piece perfectly encapsulates what you feel watching this. My only complaint
                  is a section in the middle of the movie. Something that just isn't explained. Sure, you can interpret it as you wish, but it didn't exactly make sense. It never took away from the impact of it, but it didn't make a lot of sense. That is the only thing holding me back from giving this magnificent work a 10. If you haven't watched this, you should. It's an experience.",9,Jamull2013

------
✦Story
Ahh... another superb Shinkai Makoto work and so far this is the one I ended up rating the highest. Further ado... to the story. I found it had quite a boring start, but it had superb build-up and by the end of it got me teary and emotional. I love about Makoto work that they are usually melancholic love stories. Which are beautiful yet have that sad feel to it. They end up making me as well emotional, which I really like. But ""Kimi no na Wa""
                  had a bit more of a idealistic adventure mystery with a sprinkles of romance feel to it. This was the element that was turn-off for me to a certain degree. Thus the boring start, but as the movie went on, it became much more enjoyable and interesting and after that it slowly transformed into what I love regarding Makoto work. And by the finale managed to make me emotional with absolutely superb final moment. (although it felt a bit open, but I'm certain it went towards sweet side).
Cannot really comment anything else regarding the story, it's full feels and surprises. Almost any aspect to comment would feel as a spoiler.
To sum up progression with the scoring, then Start 7/10 > mid point 8/10 > late point 9/10 > finale 10/10 . Thus I was satisfied with final scoring of 9/10.
✦Art & Sound
Shinkai Makoto / 10. No, but seriously, I have absolutely no complaints of his art & animation. On top of being superb as always, it was even better than usual and had a bit more artistic side to it.
Music & OST was also absolutely beautiful. Will be now sitting and listening to ""Kimi no na wa"" complete OST albums for a while. +their piano variations.
✦Character
I liked the main characters. Their emotional link/presentation, emotions and progression was just such a bliss to go through. Rest of cast don't have much to say about. They were fitting, but very plain. In a sense this anime was ""realistic"" regarding the characters.
But nevertheless, main cast got me teary and sad for them. Rooting/shipping them is here a thing which feels as ""Makoto, why you do this, usually you give us obvious coupling and don't play with us that much.""
✦Enjoyment & Overall
With that finale I ended up giving it 10/10 .. but then I ""calmed"" a bit and gave an actual rating. Anyhow, Makoto work with a bit less of Melancholic feel, and a bit of a slow start. But in the end, I ended up rating it the highest Makoto movie so far. Beautiful, emotional, got me teary and to some extent very warming final moments.

                Probably the weakest thing about the movie was the characters, because in my opinion there are characters in other animes that you can relate to better. I don't think the characters were bad, but they could have been better. Surely the story is not entirely understandable for many people, but I find it very interesting and not too complicated. I watched the movie three times and never thought it was getting boring.
Overall I really enjoyed this movie and it was a great start for me to get into the world of anime. I can definitely recommend the film and I also know a lot of
                  people who liked the film a lot even though they had never seen an anime before, which is why I think it's a good anime for beginners.",10,sebastiaaaaan

                It was stunning. The film is about a boy and a girl who keep waking up in each other's bodies and having to deal with one another's lives, before the girl's entire rural town gets blown up by a meteorite heading to earth. The animation (by a studio called CoMix Wave) is wonderful, the soundtrack beautiful, and the film manages to avoid some major plot-holes through the genius idea of having the protagonists memories fade like a dream when they shift back to their original bodies. This is also the only time I've seen the concept of body swapping in anime used in a non-disturbing
                  non-sexualised way, instead treating the characters, their relationships, friendships and dramas completely seriously.
The issue that lets the film down is that it seems very unrealistic that neither of the main characters realised for the majority of the film's runtime that there was a time displacement between their bodyswaps, given the fast paced development in technology, the way that the dates and days of the week didn't match up, etc. That seems like a nitpick, but given that this would imply that Taki somehow forgot that he and everyone else in Japan saw a beautiful comet suddenly split in half and smash up a town, the issue kind of seems like a huge one if you stop and think about its implications.
Despite this major plot hole however, the film still keeps up the appropriate levels of tension and drama without seeming forced, and the plot is perfectly paced, being just slow enough for the viewer to get to know and fully understand its leads while being just fast enough to not get boring. To that end, it's a lot like Empire of Corpses, another utterly beautiful recent anime movie that (unlike this one) didn't receive nearly enough attention.
The version that I watched was Anime Limited's English dub, since that was what came on the DVD I ordered, and... the dub was mixed. Most of the voice acting was fine, though not entirely convincing, and Michael Sinterniklaas really didn't sound like he was putting any effort into delivering a convincing performance at all as the lead role Taki. The real issue with the dub however is that for some bizarre reason, Anime Limited decided that they would provide English language versions of many of the original version's songs, all of which sound vastly inferior to the original movie's soundtrack. So yeah, DON'T WATCH THE DUB.
Overall 8/10 Highly recommended [BUT NOT THE DUB!]",8,TheLegendOfDan

                Makoto Shinkai is probably my favourite director for anime films, all of his films have great stories and are beautifully animated. I feel like this film definitely deserved the praise that it received from everywhere. It lived up to what we expect from a Shinkai anime film.  in this review I will be breaking apart different aspects of the film and saying what I liked and what I didn't like. I really liked this film, so if some of the things seem overly critical that is why- I just wanted to be as impartial as I could be. 
Story: The anime is an original
                  story that while it does have some things that have been done before, they were presented in a way that was new and interesting. The one ""bad"" thing I have to say about this film is that it feels like after if the film ended after the first 40 or so minutes before the big reveal started to happen, it would have been an excellent film in its own right. I do like the ending, but it feels more like an afterword to me.
Animation: Like all Shinkai animation, it was simply beautiful. I feel like some of the animation quality wasn't as sharp as other Shinkai films, but the excellent use of colour more than made up for it. 
Music: I loved the entire soundtrack, from the OP to the ED, and all of the other songs in between. Unfortunately, with having one band do 20+ songs for a 110-minute movie a few tracks sounded a little similar.
All in all, this was a fantastic film that I would recommend for anime and non-anime fans alike. If any film deserved to topple ""Spirited Away"" as the highest grossing anime film of all time, this definitely was it.",9,zimmercj

The emotional roller coaster Your Name puts you through at the end is one to never forget. It teaches a valuable lesson which is ""The mind may forget, but the heart will always remember."" The way the story flows is just amazing the scenery of the shots is fantastic, although the ritual dance is a little weird as in motions but other than that everything was perfect. People say the
                  movie can only be a masterpiece if the movie itself is a classic and the soundtrack is one to remember and boy does this soundtrack hit different.

ART: 10
I started with this because it's probably the easiest, since the art is simply amazing. It looks beautiful, and you can tell just by looking at the trailers. 
Sound: 7
I'm not rating this higher simply because I didn't find it to be anything special. This may be because of a lack of exposure to anime in general (I haven't seen all that many anime), but I didn't find the soundtrack to be amazing. I don't speak Japanese, so I can't really judge the voice acting, but sounds pretty good
                  from my perspective. 
Character: 8
I liked both the main characters, though Taki was obviously the weaker character of the two, though not because of lack of screen time. The second half of the movie is really his movie, which is alright, but I felt more of a connection to Mitsuha. Both characters felt pretty fleshed out, at least to me. 
Story: 8
I thought this movie had a really good story, though I didn't cry once during this movie. I'm not trying to sound like ""I'm just to cool to cry,"" or something like that, I just simply didn't feel those emotions to the extent that they would make me cry. This movie did tug on my heartstrings, though. The plot is interesting, though there are parts that are unexplained and you kind of have to just accept them and move on. My only other qualm with the story was that it begins to drag on in the middle, and felt almost unnecessarily long. The ending was also not the most satisfying, though it was probably the best ending possible without dropping into cliche or simple horribleness. I would have liked some more closure in the end, like showing them SPOILER HERE, SKIP TO NEXT PART IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS: getting to know each other again, even if it was short clips during the credits

                Your Name (2016) review: [9/10]
-
I had an absolute blast watching this flick.
Now obviously, There ARE better anime flicks out there.
All the classics like, Akira, My Neighbor Totoro, and all that.
But, I can't really compare them to this, Considering they all are separated in their own different genres.
Example, Akira being a sci-fi/post apocalyptic kinda flick, and Your Name, A romance drama.
For that, I can pretty much say, Your Name is definitely one of the best animes for it's own particular genre.
The story itself was great.
Some plotholes here and there but who cares 🤷‍♂️Besides, The movie sorta deals with time related continuities so, Just ignore all that.
But besides the plothole, The story was absolutely fantastic.
The characters were greatly written, We definitely felt what they felt.
The story's perfectly paced, We enter the story by not knowing anything.
Everything was confusing, But then, As the movie progresses, Things started to come together.
The chemistry for the two main characters are great.
That's why it hits harder as we get closer to the ending.
I may not be a big fan of the time related thing but, It definitely fits well to the story.
Setting up this big ""oof"" feeling.
You know what? I think i'm startin to like the whole time related thingy.
But seriously, The best part bout the whole movie, Is clearly the story 👍🏻
Secondly, The animation.
The animation was great, The colors, The movement, The animation itself of course, Was great.
The best part about the animation's definitely the colors.
The colors changed based on the mood of the scene, That's great.
Sometimes it's bright and charming, and in other scenes, It's sort of softer.
Lastly, The voice acting.
The voice acting was great.
The performance was definitely terrific, We can sorta feel how the scene goes just by the voices.
Again, Story's the best part.
But, That's up for you to decide.
Overall, It's a great movie.
With a mix of a well written story with great characters and great chemistry between all of them, Brilliant animation, and decently great voice acting...

                This is easily one of the worst things that i watched this year.
Story: A complete mess. There are the times where the plot is beyond insulting when it comes to originality. I was able to predict almost every ""plot twist"" from miles away.
Also the movie is never clear regarding its target audience. Does the movie wants people who are crazy focused, people that dont try to think too much about the plot, people with absolutely no brain cells? Well i dunno so lets just put scenes that target all of those people individually. So yeah there are scenes that require a shit ton of focus
                  so you dont miss anything and then there are multiple scenes of spiritual sexual harassment... ugh.
The interaction between... wait a minute. The main characters (almost) never interact with each other directly...
I'm pathetic when it comes to romance stories (that aren't the main atraction but rather a side story or something that is there but you dont have to mind too much about). Whatever crap you show me will always receive praise because im a sucker for it. But when it comes to a fully romance focused story my critic sense is on alert. Kimi no Na wa is not a romance story. This movie is not about romance. I cant be more clear about it.
There never is a reason for why these characters should care about each other at all.
Their ""interactions"" are friendly but that's about it. Aside from the pseudo sexual harassment (what does that mean? Well there is the dude, he goes into the girls body like this were some hentai anime and he starst grabing her chest and this happens like 5 times on screen and god knows how many times he did that) there is  absolutely no reason for these characters to have romantic feelings for each other (there is even a part where the girl seems to be into girls. Maybe she is bisexual i dunno).
There is no originality at all on the movie and when it comes to stories of this ""genre"" (the ones that saw the movie know what im talking about, mentioning it would be spoiler even though anyone with a few functioning brain cells could figure out the plot twist) the ammount of movies, shows, videogames and animes that use this and are genuinely good at it is inmense. 
I highly doubt that i ever saw an story of this ""genre"" that i disliked. How can you do something poorly with this ""genre""? Probably the most surprising part of the story is how poorly writen it was.
There is an insane ammount of wasted screen time where we see shots of Tokyo (i explain my personal disdain with this on ""Art""), some japanese places, random characters that arent on the show, etc (the first scene is justified and it comes with a nice song too but the moment is prolonged for too long and it quickly loses its charm).
Art: It looked cute i guess i dont have any complaint but it didnt blew my mind.
It's obvious that this movie wasn't aiming for western gaijins like me and instead it tried to catch the eye of Japan.
Sound: There is so many things wrong with this.
Imagine i dunno Friday 13, Alien or Saw. Now imagine that while some people are about to be dismembered or chopped in half in incredibly gory scenes there was some kpop song banging on the background or i dunno a Barbie doll song (im a barbie world in a plastic world whatever).
This is what happens on the movie. Incredibly terrifing scenes where me as an spectator is listening to some soothing and cute song but what's happening on screen doesnt match this at all.
There is such a massive ammount of bad stuff happening on the movie yet the songs never pair with those scenes properly.
Why in the world when people are going to die im listening to some artist giving her 100% in a cute song like everything was okay?
It's insulting. I'm a human watching this. I'm being shown that bad stuff is going to happen.
I'm not supposed to smile when bad stuff happens... what the hell Makoto Shinkai?
Characters: One word. Inconceivable. Even to anime standards.
The characters are so dumb and fake that they take you away from enjoying the ride.
Their reactions are so incredibly cliche. Unless you were born yesterday there is absolutely no way that you can be surprised by their answers or reactions.
The main cast is so poorly written and their horrible voice acting doesnt help (there are a few screams here and there but it feels like they were playing some online game at 3 AM so they cant rise their voice or their parents will scold them... what the hell? Scream harder! It is so infuriating.).
A few of the characters reaction seem to point out at new side stories but they never go anywhere. The thing is that this movie last almost 2 hours but the actual movie lasts for 40 mins at best so its not like there was no extra time to be spent into polishing the main story or presenting the side stories or doing anything. 
There is a massive ammount of ""wasted"" screen time (im not complaining about a few scenes here and there showing the scenery but jesus christ i almost fell asleep a few times for how predictable or slow everything was going. I even considered playing Pokemon on my phone a couple of times since absolutely nothing that was being shown on screen was surprising me, not even a tiny bit).
Enjoyment: If the movie lasted for i dunno 1 hour i could have enjoyed it a little bit more.
I want the time i wasted watching this mess back. There was absolutely nothing that i enjoyed of this movie.
Well i liked the few scenes where we see the kitchen of a restaurant but i work at one so im pretty sure that was the reason.
Don't waste your time.
Final thougts: I cant think of nothing that makes this movie worth watching.
It's not sad, it cant evoke my feelings (""When this is going to get good?"" doesnt count) nor it can make me cry (it's not hard! In less than 5 minutes a show like i dunno BNHA with no build up whatsoever was able to make me cry twice. So it's not like you need a shit ton of time building a house of cards to make me feel sad).
I feel that this could have worked better as an anime and a movie cannot properly present the story (that is not good on any level but at the very least it could have been properly shown right?).
The songs felt so unnecesary 90% of the time and from that % a big chunk could be classified as insulting.
Even the damn SAO the worst story ever made wasnt as poorly written as Kimi no Na wa.
I'm comparing SAO to Kimi no Na wa? Yeah
Well what more do you expect from this review... i really wanted to like this. Seriously.
But it was a complete waste of time.
edit Afterthoughts: I might sound like im deeply concerned about originality when it comes to stories but that couldnt be more wrong.
If a story is well written and well presented it doesnt matter if its originality its crap.
I love Black Clover and that show is a lot of things but original. I feel like i had the necesity to point this on the end. Originality is never a problem when i look at some anime. When something its unoriginal and absolute garbage then it's like it adds salt to the wound but thats pretty much it.
Kimi no Na wa is terrible but being unoriginal just makes the story it tries to tell even worse.",2,CordobezEverdeen

Tbh it was a mixed bag for me. The visuals and sounds were abosoutely beautiful but the story and characters were way to confusing.
The first half of the story was pretty decent, a slice of life type of anime and I liked it. But then the second half of the story became complicated and way to confusing to understand. All of a sudden you got time travel, magic, and a bunch of unexplained things. The plot being not properly set and having like 2 differnt climaxes. It could have been way less confusing if they explained it properly.
The characters were alright. You got
                  the two main characters Taki and Mitsuha who have their bodies switch every once in a while and overtime they become closer and closer. You got the side charcters such as Mitsuh'a sister Yotsuha and Taki's date Miki. Most of them dont have any solidifed purposes except for Misuha's grandma who played an interesting role in the end.
The visuals were an eye candy! I could go on and on about each litte thing but it is better if you see the film. The music was great and the songs really matched with the atmosphere of the movie with likable voice acting.

                Your name is a film that thrives on simplicity, but it doesent go as far with it as i hoped.
its a film that does things that other, big budget movies LOVE to do.
trick your brain into thinking the movie appeals to you when it really appeals to everyone.
Just like Marvel films, and some other anime films, Your name does alot of things in an attempt to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. it never goes far into one genre, wallowing in sci-fi, comedy, romance, and slice of life specifically, and as a fan of all these genres it would appeal to me on
                  paper, right?
exactly.
by having such a broad appeal, Your Name fails to inject any uniqueness into the film. and while Your Name is said to make people cry, my eyes were dry as bone. it is by no means a terrible movie, just like some marvel films and anime, it feels unfair to say it isnt good, it is good. but unlike some truly great peices of media, it doesent want to appeal to a specific audience, afraid of insulting other ones. 
this is why it made so much money, because it uses a trick that i hate. make the film broad and samey in order to maximise profits. i liked the film, but i felt manipulated or shoved in a certain direction. I originally watched this film expecting the body swapping to remain the main plot point, but i got too much of too little. And thats why its a 6. its Art is amazing, and the studio probably neglected alot of animators to make it that good, the sound design is nice, but it lacks identity. i enjoyed the characters, but only because there wasnt a reason to hate them or love them, they didnt appeal to me or turn me off in the same way the plot does.
in my opinion, characters make the story, and plot is super important in any peice of media. and by having such a broad range of appeal, it ticked the popularity box, but its sadly shallow and unassuming. it avoids any risks and plays it safe. i dont regret watching it, but i wont be again",6,TurnoverHD

                At first, I thought this would be like other plain romance anime. It is pretty boring and confusing at first, but as I watch it, the story become more exciting and I fell in love with the story. It involves two main characters that have amazing background and the plot is really good. The storyline is really good and enjoyable for boys or girls, especially teenagers who love a good calm romance anime.
The music are also very good and it gives us a calm feeling in watching the movie.
My opinion is this is the best romance anime movie I have ever watched.

                This is a beautiful piece of art. The story is solid and doesn't waver from the main plot. Side characters and stories were at a minimum, which allowed for the focus to stay on our 2 protagonists. 
Visuals were spot on as well. Colors, scenes, details to both and more are so well done. The greatest thing I found was how they flowed with the scenes, adapted near perfectly to each necessary event. Weather, time of day, changing in between all of those as needed were great. I'm a real stickler for the visuals and I was really pleased with these.
Taki and Mitsuha are worlds
                  apart but so close without understanding it. They feel a connection, though, and it drives them to great lengths to get to each other. They couldn't understand where the connection was from or how they found it, but it carries them in magnificent directions and successes among failures, right until the end.

Wow, this anime movie was totally a great movie. Many people found this anime as a masterpiece, and I understand why. What really touched me was the story. The story is about a guy and a girl living totally different lives, but one day each of them wakes up in each other's room. None of them are sure what's happening, so they assume they are just dreaming. Soon they notice that in fact, it isn't just a dream. Their bonds had connected, and there's a reason why.

So, Kimi no Na wa(.), a hyped movie indeed. I watched it at the Stockholm Film Festival on November 20th, so I really got to experience the fantastic art that this movie has, and the art is probably what this movie succeeds the most in. Seriously, the sceneries, the characters, everything looks amazing.
The sound is amazing, there's a lot of song and light acoustic guitars, which I felt was really fitting. The voice actors did a great job to make the characters sound natural, nothing to complain about there.
The story is absolutely fantastic too, but a lot of things make no sense. That didn't bother me much, but it may really bother some people. The thing about this story is that it's heavily centered around the two main characters, which means that it's all about how good those characters are. Our protagonists Mitsuha and Taki are very well written, but I felt like the movie went on with its plot way too quickly before I grew attached to them, and that's the huge flaw this movie has. I could have enjoyed the amazing story this movie has so much more if I got to know Mitsuha and Taki more than I did. And I'm somewhat sad about that.
If you're someone who can easily get attached to fictional characters, you will enjoy this movie more than I did. But if you're someone who doesn't get attached as easy, you might not enjoy it as much. I will still recommend Kimi no Na wa(.) because of its great art, its great sound, and its interesting story.",9,calleha

                Let’s write a short review for you guys.
Well, so today I watched Kimi no Na wa and I have to say...incredible, amazing, heartbreaking, lovely and so on. Story is really original and It will pull you into a journey of two young people who are trying to find each other. It sounds like a classical romance, but You will see it is not. I have never seen such an original story and the way how it expresses feelings. What did I enjoyed the most was music and characters in this anime. RADWIMPS did a great job. Music is energic (sometimes sad) but It wants you
                  to understand and appreciate every moment in this movie. Each character has its own path to walk and the more far they are the more they are starting to understand themselves. In the end They reveal, what they truly want. I found that to be honest, UNIQUE and heart-warming. I think if you are not kinda into romance, drama etc. stuff, you won’t be amazed, but its a common thing :D. If you love this genre, you are on the right place! And I can say you won’t be dissapointed.

                Keeping it short:
10's are rare for me. I really really like this movie, everything just clicked for me. I very rarely rewatch anything, and I've already watched this 4 times from when I first saw it 3 years ago, and haven't minded at all. 
At its core, the story is a pure love story about two people struggling to overcome all odds to be together. The circumstances aren't the ordinary, but the core of the story is the sort of thing I think of when I think of a love story.
The art is beautiful. Lots of detail, nice colors, gorgeous environmental art. There are plenty
                  of scenes where I want to pause just to look at the environments. Love the scenes where it's dusk.
The soundtrack is great and matches the quality of the art. Really lovely work, especially some of the tracks that are chamber pieces, like when the grandma is talking about threads while they walk up the mountain.
The characters are well written and likeable.

                Another masterpiece by the man himself, Makoto Shinkai.
**Spoilers ahead, as the reviewer is expected to have seen the movie**
**Also, bear with me as Im trying my best to review. Im not good with words,
   but I swear that Im trying to be as clear as possible. Here we go!**
Kimi no na wa is beautiful in every way. So much effort and dedication was put into this movie.
The story =9
Another unique story, I'd say.
Its about two young kids; a girl named Mitsuha who lives in the town called Itomori, and a boy named Taki from Tokyo. The story throughout was a journey to figure
                  out their situation; how they swap bodies, what occured it, and why
Lots of comedic bits too, making the scenes more worth to watch. Like the intro part for Mitsuha and Taki....man, can't take their actions off my head.
Despite all the commotions, the story stayed strong and on-topic, so much so that it made every character matter. When the scenes introduced us the main characters, we get more lines from the friends or family, laying out each other's traits as the story goes along.
One flaw though, is that we didnt get to see action beyond Mitsuha screaing in front of her mirror. (I guess Shinkai seriously respects women)
But nonetheless, the story was structered really well
The characters =8
Besides the main characters, we have their family and friends that played great roles as they ""somewhat accepted"" to join Mitsuha or Taki's journey. Every character was unique and strongly resembles the settings theyre in.
For example, Mitsuha doesnt like her life in Itomori, and would rather be a boy who lives in Tokyo. Meanwhile her friend Tessie would rather stay and continue living in Itomori and work in the construction company his father is in.
Strong story + unique characters that can relate = great roles
The voice acting on each character did awesome jobs, especially the comedic bits.
As an English speaker though, I had to give more props to the English VAs for making the movie extra better! They translated the characters like it was NOTHIN! Especially the intro scenes, and the scene involving Yotsuha's response to her big sister's screaming....cant wait to own the English version on Bluray!
Another flaw though, was Taki's family side. We get Mitsuha's, but what about the loner Taki-kun's? We get to see the dad, but not much story of him or the rest of Taki's family.
Kinda puts my ""importance"" review to shame, but I guess some stories had to be put down til someone asks Makoto Shinkai himself.
The scenery and objects they drew in the movie.. =10
Itomori's (unfortunately fictional) landscapes and Tokyo's were greatly drawn into the anime. If youre going to watch this movie in crisp 1080p HD, you eill see how much effort the animators and drawers put into the scenes. 
The lighting, the shades, and the solid structures (roads, walls, even a piece of chalk or pencil) were beautifully drawn throughout.
What got me the most was how they used sunlight to make things even spookier or more memorable. The scenes with the sunlight just....lighten up the mood of the scene.
Sure, we may have seen it in his previous movies, but I still had to say it.
**I watched Kimi no na wa bwfore watching his two other ones, like Garden of Words and 5 cm/sec**
Themes, a band, background sounds, and two different bells....=8
When I hear the 1st theme song play in the background, I was expecting this whole movie as if uts an anime episode. I mean, its AWESOME, Im trying to sing their English version now (sang by the same Japanese singer making his best English sentences)
But thats the thing. Its.....kinda distracting, ruining the theme of the story for a bit. I'm still glad that theyve adjusted themselves to fit into the scenes to summ up Taki's and Mitsuha's situation, and itll forever be in my head.
But aside the songs, the background music and natural sounds are very well done, in detail and to give a theme of the scene.
Especially the Kataware-doki scene....its been a fan favourite ever since. I will never forget it, because the theme and the story blends in as one, giving the characaters a chance to shine, then...-----
You'll understand why.
Overall, my score would be 9.
Not every story was made perfect, but if the focus was to make a beautiful story while pushing yourself to make the best scenery and making the characters memorable and cooler, it will become something more than just perfect.
Ive definitely enjoyed the ride. And you will too.

                TLDR: 88/100 - Would recommend to anyone.  
This film is pretty darn good. For reference, I have never fully watched or enjoyed a romance film or anime. But this one is a definite exception. The director - Makoto Shinkai is known for being a master of his craft, and it shows in his biggest blockbuster yet. The film utilises beautiful animation, an energetic soundtrack, and a fantastic direction to provide an experience akin to the hype it accrued.
The two main characters Taki and Mitsuha may be run-of-the-mill high-schoolers (cliché but hey) but the emotions they convey are grounded and realistic. They tend to remind
                  me of the time when I was in high school, which warrants a certain relatability to them. Although, they are not as fleshed out as I would have hoped. If there was another scene or two relating to their hobbies or aspirations it would have helped in establishing both characters. The characterisation that did occur was cleverly done and limited the amount of exposition needed for their development. Additionally, there is some romance between the two, but it forms quite subtly and has less to do with the characters’ actions and more with the expectations that the viewer has going into it. 
“It is a romance film, so they have to fall in love!”.
Additionally, the bonds between the main characters and the side/support characters could have been explored a little more. This would emphasise how the characters are acting of the ordinary when around each other. As for the premise of the story, it may be simplistic; but it leaves room for the complications that evolve throughout. The story itself was woven together in such a way that made it feel natural and easy to follow while watching. 
In terms of Your Name’s visual and artistic merit, it passes with flying colours. The composition of every shot is clearly outlined. The effects used (blur, lens flair etc.) draw out and emphasise the emotion of the scene while not being overused to the point of it becoming a gimmick. The artwork consists of clean linework and vibrant yet natural colours. Furthermore, the animation quality is superb, richly flowing from scene to scene.
Although I do not know Japanese and watched the subbed variant I could still feel the intensity of their voices. The lines are not overacted, fit the context of each scene, and have a certain warmness to them. The music features the Japanese indie rock band: RADWIMPS. The rock tone gives a sense of teenage rebellion which mirror that of the main protagonists and the world they perceive. This makes it a perfect fit for the film. As for the sound design, I did not notice anything particularly special, but it was generally well made and mastered. Overall, this film is delightful to listen to.
Your Name was released in 2016. Has it survived the hype? Four years later, in 2020, it is still worth the praise. The artwork is still incredible, the music is great and youth-esque, and the art/animation is still a joy to look at. 
I am sure it will become a classic in the years to come.

                Kimi no na wa é um filme visualmente lindo com uma bela trilha sonora, mas o enredo do filme é muito esquisito, a personagem principal feminina ainda tem carisma e um desenvolvimento legal mas o personagem masculino é um zé ninguém que o filme nem se preocupa em mostrar nada, exceto um possível interesse romântico no trabalho, que por sinal tem uma melhor abordagem que o relacionamento dos personagens principais que se apaixonam literalmente por mensagens (?). 
A explicação dos eventos sobrenaturais do filme não fazem sentido algum, afinal como diabos alguém não percebe que está em um dia diferente de um ano diferente? Japoneses
                  tem um forte senso de compromisso então é meio estranho eles não perceberem as datas. Como que a protagonista feminina não percebeu que o zé ninguém estava 3 anos mais novo quando se encontrou com ele pela primeira vez? No período da adolescência é onde o ser humano mais tem mudança em um curto período de tempo. 
O final é bem sem graça pois um anime que era para ser de romance, não teve literalmente romance e acaba da forma mais anti-climática possível que é o gancho para o ''imagine ai''.

                I don't really write reviews, in fact, I've only written one. However, when I saw this movie I knew I had to write one as soon as I finished. There is no spoilers in this review, by the way.
Story: Going into this anime, I was not expecting a good story, I thought it was only praised for its good animation, so I was pleasantly surprised when I finished it. The story is at some points illogical and can be confusing, but it is so full of heart and wholesome, that it is impossible not to like. Fans of any slice of life show will enjoy
                  this.
Art: Of course the art and animation in this film are fantastic. Everything is so detailed and well animated. I was not expecting the vast amounts of colors in this film though, and I was happy to see it. This film does what most others fail to do, the animation is done so well, it is used to enhance the story, make you feel sad, happy, and angry. This movie would have still been great even if there was no voice acting, because the animation itself tells the story.
Sound: Both the score and insert songs were amazing for this movie. I watched this dubbed, as I only have funimation. They put so much effort into the music in this movie, that funimation even had the original singers of the insert song and op (radwimps) sing the songs in english and they were still great! The score was also fantastic and enhance the story almost as much as the animation, and gave me goosebumps everytime I heard the beginning of a musical piece. If you are someone who really pays attention to musical scores, you will really like what Your Name has to offer. 
Characters: There's not too much to say about the two main characters. Both are extremely likeable and charming. It does not take long to get invested in these two. Between Taki and Mitsuha, you will deffinately be able to relate to atleast one of them. The side characters are also extremely likeable.
Final Verdict / Enjoyment: It doesn't matter if an anime is critically acclaimed or considered down right garabage, as long as you enjoy it. I knew I had to watch this movie eventually, and I am glad I finally did it. This movie is one of the most wholesome and heartful anime and feature film I have watched in a long time. I highly reccomend you watch this, it is less than two hours, so even if you do not enjoy it as much as I did, it won't take as much time as binging an actual show. This movie reminded me of why I started to watch anime, and I feel like it spoke to me on a deeper level than most shows, and if you read some more reviews, I am sure it is the same for others.",9,Korean_Brunch

I was actually looking forward to watching this anime film from Makoto Shinkai since I had already seen some of his previous works. I have to say that this is by far his weakest output yet. Not because of the visuals: they were stunning. Not because of the acting: it was pretty good. Rather it was the story that made this film stumble: the narrative was pretty easy to follow but the premise was executed haphazardly, with the most glaring flaw staring at the face of the main characters yet they hardly notice it *cough* smartphone *cough*. Nevertheless,
                  watching the film was a nice experience in itself though I don't see myself watching it as much as I did with Makoto's past films.",6,rzantua

                My favorite film of all time. Your Name makes you think about the nature of true love. Are soul mates real? This is not a typical body switching story as the trailer suggests, but has a powerful twist that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
On top of such a powerful yet simple story, Makoto Shinkai and team have outdone themselves with crisp art and animation. The world building is among the best I've seen, with amazing contrast between the picturesque countryside and city life. Finally, the music is the best soundtrack ever. It is healing, relaxing music. I've seen this film so many
                  times, because it is the ultimate soother, helping me unwind and fall sleep after a long day at work.",10,jaamun100
32281,"
                Keep in mind when reading this that the only anime movies I've seen before this are Tenki no Ko (Weathering with You) and Koe no Katachi (A Silent Voice/The Shape of Voice).
THERE ARE SPOILERS BELOW!
Story: 7
I love slice of life media, so the first half or so of the story was very enjoyable. Coming from Tenki no Ko, I thought it would be dramatic and serious, but it set the scene for a much lighter and easier watch than I was expecting.
Throughout the story onwards, it became kind of confusing to me. I didn't know who was who, I didn't know what the timeline was,
                  and I didn't understand how Taki in Mitsuha's body was getting away with all the things he was. People just believed him or didn't, they didn't question what the hell was going on. In the last third or so, everything except for the memory loss and Mitsuha disappearing before she could write her name felt contrived and a bit too smooth.
Art: 9
I'm always blown away by the atmosphere that comes from the background and beautiful camerawork. Of course, the animation is front and center, and completely rightfully so. It's beautiful and elevates even the slice of life scenes into something enjoyable and fun while taking the dramatic scenes to a whole other level.
Sound: 8
The voice acting was pretty good throughout, there's nothing really of note. The soundtrack was incredible, though. Every single song, instrumental or not, brought the scenes to life. While I wasn't sure about the voice acting being up to par, the soundtrack was on the same level as the art: stunning, atmospheric, and perfectly fitting.
Character: 6
I don't believe Shinkai's strong suit is unique or interesting characters or designs. Both Tenki no Ko and this have pretty bland characters. I honestly enjoyed some of the side characters more than the typical protagonists (like Taki's school friends and Mitsuha's sister). There's nothing more to note about them.
Enjoyment: 8
As I said before, I love slice of life, and the directing and editing style and camerawork made the scenes have stellar pacing. It's exactly what I loved about the style of Tenki no Ko, and now I'm excited to watch more of Shinkai's movies with the hope that this pacing will persist.
Confusion unfortunately took off some of the points, but oh well. Maybe I just need to rewatch it. I did watch it at 12 am.
Overall: 8
This was by all means an above average movie. It presents a digestible premise and executes it well. Very well. I don't see why this is held as a classic, but it's definitely not horrible.",8,Lychee3

                Could you fall in love with someone by living his/her life?
The first time I watched 'Your Name' in theater, I was washed away by its beauty. Yes, the animation was so captivating basically every scene can be my wallpaper. However, it's the story that wrung the heart. The idea that the connection of person to person can create something of a miracle; not just through love, but also through heritage and the act of passing on things we hold dear to each other. That our names can be so meaningful when it's spoken from someone who see through us.
Today, watching it the second time, I
                  was very impressed by the storytelling skills that sprinkled clues & foreshadowed out leads connection bit by bit in the anime. While I remembered most of the plots, the scenes that hit, still hits hard. The anime let us fully immersed with each character's perspective and trust the audience to figure things out along the way. I love that the setting of Tokyo and the small town is a character on its own, creating a world that is familiar, but also unique. Taki and Misuha are also active characters, I mean our boy's nothing short of a hero here, which makes you so invested in their happiness. The only thing I wished was to see more, but I guess that's also why it's great.",10,tele_fon

i enjoyed a lot watching the movie but there is one problem ive got after,wich is getting sick of it (felling troubles) for a week and only think about that movie.
 all the (romantic,drama) animes genres have that feeling after watching it, a lot of peapol don't watch romantic animes/films cause of that feeling including me but in this movie its absulotly fantastic i actually recommend that it depends on your age and your experience in this type of stories

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
Your name is a beautifully animated story about young love. The soundtrack is good, and the characters are believable and relatable, but nothing too special. The biggest issue with the movie is with the twist you find out halfway through (more on that a bit later).
The animation is beautiful and fluid, the effects are great, and the backgrounds are extremely detailed as well. This movie is nothing if not beautiful to look at.
The things that each character focus on when in the other's body are funny. And I think the running joke of Taki feeling Mitsuha's boobs whenever he switches into her
                  body was done just enough to work, but not too much that is gets tiresome.
Because the body swapping happens across a 3 year gap and apparently neither character figured this out at any point during the body swapping despite being on each others phones enough to have the date look at them every day. For this we have to just accept that there isn't a good explanation, they just never knew (somehow). It's frustrating when the townspeople wouldn't listen about their impending doom, but I guess that's probably what would happen. The will they won't they dynamic get tiresome pretty quickly, especially when they both get off a train to see the other person and almost just walk by eachother as if they're not dying to say something to the other.
The meteor came as a surprise and was a great twist, especially on the shot of the mountain where it is going from before and after the meteor strike. This built up an interesting conflict for the characters to solve.
Overall it was a good watch, but it was not without its fair share of flaws.",8,Dualsaga184
32281,"
                You know it's hard for me to rate a series 10/10, with anything. Because it usually implies it's perfect, but almost nothing is perfect.
This was my first Anime ""Movie"" I've finished Death Note, currently watching Attack on Titan & Monster but as far as movies are concerned. This was my first.
I did very much enjoy this series, but I can't really judge it compared to other anime seeing as how it's my one of my first anime's I've watched.
The ending kind of left me disappointed, I would've liked more of a conclusion rather than a cut off at the most important part of the entire
                  thing. Maybe the manga will clear it up, I plan to pick up the manga eventually.
Overall, I'd give it an 9.",9,RustyPenny

                After almost a year of avoiding any kind of spoilers and resisting the temptation of asking my friends on their thoughts on this critically acclaimed film in full detail, I finally got the opportunity to watch ""Kimi no Na wa."" a few months ago when the Blu-ray came out in all of its 1080p glory.
And, well, let's start with the good stuff first.
(Anyway, there's a TL;DR in the end if you're too lazy to read everything)
Art - 10
Do I even need to explain myself here? The art and animation in this movie was gorgeous. Every shot, every background image, the character movement. It was beautifully
                  rendered and executed. I found my eyes sticking to our television because of how pretty all the colors went and blended with each other. Some of the shots looked so realistic that I had to make sure if I was watching an anime or not.
Really though, most of the frame in this film can serve as a good wallpaper. That's when you just know how amazing the art is. Props to Makoto Shinkai for giving us an extremely memorable cinematic experience.
Sound - 10
God, I totally LOVE the soundtrack for this movie. No, not just the more popular ones like Nandemonaiya, or Zen Zen Zen se, but every track in the OST album. In fact, the only other reason why I really wanted to watch this movie (aside from its great popularity) is because I heard all of its OST from my friend's phone. The dramatic instrumentals which consist of pianos and other stringed instruments (Kataware Doki being my favorite) just made a huge impact on me as someone who also plays piano and a bit of violin on the side. But, honestly, all the instrumentals are really good to listen to.
RADWIMPS was the perfect choice for the tracks with vocals. I honestly can't imagine any other band singing Sparkle or Yume Tourou.
When I heard these songs playing in the movie, it just made me feel happy. They fit so well, especially when you know the meaning of the lyrics. They resonated so well with the scenes that it just makes you feel a mix of emotions that you can't explain.
And here I am a year later, listening to this same OST on repeat while writing this review. You know, just to give you an idea of how much I love the music in this film (as if I didn't make that clear enough).
Story - 7
...okay. 
This is where things start to get a little, uh, rocky.
Although I thought the end was wrapped up pretty nicely, the whole story in general was a bit lacking in my opinion. To give you all a basic summary, this is how the story goes:
Mitsuha and Taki are both teenagers living completely different lives in completely different locations in Japan. Mitsuha is a country girl who lives near the mountains, while Taki is your typical city boy. One day, they, for some reason, have the ability to switch bodies at random times when they wake up first thing in the morning. As time goes on, they decide that they want to meet each other. And, well, there are twists along the way.
Nothing new, honestly. Although, the twists did do a good job of surprising me, but that's where it ends. The ending also left me with a bittersweet feeling.
Characters - 6
Now, the constant problem with films is that they usually don't have enough time to flesh out characters to make them memorable enough to the viewers so they won't forget their names after their scene is up. 
Kimi no Na wa has that same problem.
Alright, I challenge you to give me a name of a character from this film that's not Taki or Mitsuha. 
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Granted, the main focus of this film is that its primary focus is solely on our two main protagonists. However, the film manages to fail fleshing out the characters of these two main leads that they become quite one dimensional.
Little spoiler, but that one scene where Taki finds out about Mitsuha's past was a little underwhelming. It felt to me like it was just put there to make the audience know more about Mitsuha in a span of a few minutes. Spoiler alert, it doesn't work that way. But, hey, at least the art in that scene was beautiful.
Just who is Mitsuha? Just who is Taki? Does Taki even have a backstory to back up and justify his own actions in the film?
I may have missed something while watching this, but I don't think I got clear answers to these questions at all.
Personal enjoyment - 8
Despite all of these flaws, I still enjoyed watching this film. Although, it was more because of the soundtrack and art rather than the characters and the actual plot.
Does this film deserve the praise it's getting? Well, yeah. But how about the massive popularity it has achieved? We may have differing opinions, but I don't think even Makoto Shinkai expected this film to reach this level of popularity.
Overall, I give this an 8 out of 10. Great film if you want to watch something with amazing animation.
TL;DR
+ Amazing soundtrack
+ Just as amazing art and animation
+ A great cinematic experience
+ Great to watch if you just want to watch any random movie
+ The twists were pretty surprising
- The movie fails to flesh out the characters despite only having their primary focus on two of them, making them feel one-dimensional
- Story isn't anything new, really",8,shirahane
32281,"
                This movie was disappointing for me. I enjoyed the first third of it, and then it steadily went downhill after a specific point. I watched it two times, several years apart, and my opinion remains mostly unchanged. The movie has pretty art and colors, but the writing and characters fall flat. I would not watch this movie on my own accord; I had only rewatched it as a means to spend time with a friend who I haven’t spoken to in a long time.
- Story. The story has some magical/supernatural elements and time skipping, but it’s not difficult to follow. I think there was a
                  missed opportunity for the movie to become a thriller, due to the incremental revelations of the time skipping phenomenon and the tragedy that the two main characters try to prevent. Furthermore, there needed to be clearer development of two critical aspects for the plot: the romantic relationship between the two main characters and buy-in of several characters to engage in what is essentially domestic terrorism.
- Characters. The main characters are kind of bland. I think the supporting cast are a little more interesting. 
I don’t have an issue with Mitsuha’s more muted or serious personality, but she doesn’t really have more dimension when she is interacting with her friends. She is somewhat mischievous when interacting with Taki. 
With Taki, he also acts more serious but the audience is again told by another character, not shown, that he is supposedly hot headed. I can recall only one scene that actually depicted that part of this personality. Another character later tells us that Taki has changed, but I don’t see the point in making this statement if there was not a clear standard to compare his personality to in the first place.
- Art. Pretty lineart, gorgeous colors, great art and style direction. 
- Animation. Beautiful.
- Music. The actual background music was unmemorable, but the songs with lyrics used at several points were really nice. However, I do not have an emotional connection to the songs - so they are simply pretty to me. 
- Sound design. Also largely unmemorable, if not for a few well timed suzu bell chimes. 
- Writing. 
To elaborate on what I mentioned in the Story section, the romance was really out of place to me. In fact, I think the director was aware of this which is why supporting characters had to TELL us that the one of the main characters is in love with someone else leading up to the confession. There was definitely an entire montage showing the development of a close platonic relationship. I would have preferred if it stayed that way and hinted at the start of a romance at the very end. Not only would it have made more sense, but it would have also been thematically appropriate. It wouldn’t have detracted from the plot either; you can indeed care deeply about someone without falling in love with them. There was even a scene of unconscious realization of love that I thought was stupid. Maybe instead of having a character cry and wonder about it, they could have spent that time showing them blushing at something the other character wrote to them. Even one instance of this would have been more sensible than none. I don’t buy the angle “it’s a movie, so they don’t have enough time to show development”. Yes they can. Maybe remove one of three scenes in which one of the main characters is groping boobs and replace it with actual character development. It’s not that hard! 
Next, one of the main characters basically has to convince their friends to destroy public property in order to prevent the tragedy that only the main character knows is going to happen. One friend straight up says that’s a crime… and then casually goes along with it? The other friend was built up to believe in conspiracy theories, but was not provided any convincing evidence to readily agree to committing domestic terrorism and potentially damaging the reputation of his father’s company. There was even a lighthearted montage leading up to the plan.
Furthermore, I was not a fan of the cringy dialogue between Taki and Mitsuha. There is a key scene in which they are supposed to have a quirky teenager conversation highlighting their relationship. Instead, it comes off as jarring and inappropriate for the time and place, considering the tragedy is about to occur and they are bantering about groping boobs.  
- Emotional impact. I laughed two times, once because something was stupid and the other time I thought something was genuinely funny. I was either neutral or negative (thinking “this is stupid/necessary/nonsensical"") towards everything else. The movie lacked true catharsis or buildup. I think the only great cut was in the first third of the movie before the first song started playing. For the reasons discussed in the Writing section, I felt nothing during the scene that is commonly regarded as the most emotional point of the movie. The reaction that the film wanted to elicit from me was not justified.",4,pickyviewer
32281,"
                People had been recommending me this movie, since a long time. Given all the expectations built up, Makoto Shinkai did not fail to suprise me.
If you love emotional dramas or dramatic science fiction, then this is a highly recommended movie. The picturesque art and the screenplay are so engaging, characteristic of Shinkai that one could easily find oneself gazing at the beautiful skylines. Radwimps has produced a wonderful music, that coalesces perfectly with the emotional flavour of the story. The plot was great and the twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat till the end.
There were times when I was suspicious
                  about alternative solutions to problems faced by the characters but, they were honestly answered by the director.
I believe the character development was not to the zenith, however small depictions still make the film gripping till the end. Maybe the transient nature and character shifts were a trade-off for the depth of character subtleties.",9,Excalibur2512

                Kimi no Na wa is a movie that had a lot of hype going into the movie. Spoken as an NA viewer, it's rare to be on the receiving end of the hype, as were the ones who are usually the ones to get first dibs on most of the movies we get the chance to see. As the hype piles on over months and months from Europe and Asia, do I feel that the movie has met its expectations?
Yes, I believe it did. 
Story: 8/10
The story plays around with the supernatural a lot, more so than I initially thought. It integrates the concepts quite
                  well, but I had a few minor details that I would nitpick regarding the usage of these supernatural elements. Usage of said elements might also make it a bit difficult to follow the story as a whole, though more specifically how time is structured and when the events are played out.
I also really liked the changes in perspectives throughout the movie. It was refreshing to see how the main characters would adapt to this body switching phenomenon, and seeing how they worked together in order to achieve said adaptation was a whole other journey in itself.
Characters: 9/10
I really enjoyed the progression in character and relationship development over the course of the story. The way the characters act when their bodies have switched is one that felt very fun. 
They added their own spice to the others personalities, and the initial body switching reaction was one that had me really impressed. The mannerisms and body language portrayed during the switches was one that felt very real, which is only further conveyed by the wonderful directing choices and great acting on behalf of the voice actors.
Sound: 9/10
Despite the lack of anime VA experience for Mone Kamishiraishi and Ryunosuke Kamiki, I felt they hit it out of the park in terms of voicing Taki and Mitsuha. It's hard enough to do voice the one character you're supposed to portray, but having to voice two different characters and their attempts to express both personalities is an impressive feat in itself. 
The OST was great throughout the movie, and aside from what I considered to be a confusing ""second opening"" around the first quarter of the film, the band doing the themes songs was very upbeat and memorable. What made the OST so good was the simplicity of it in some parts, and the majestic feel it brought during the height of certain scenes. Even the lack of sound or music at certain points of the music forced me to glue my eyes to the screen, making sure I didn't missed out a single detail of the movie.
Art: 10/10
When it needed to be pretty, it did an extremely fine job in doing so. Shots of the scenery is one that I've had the extreme pleasure of viewing, the character designs depicted the ordinary high school student quite well, and it is in line with Makoto Shinkai's other beautiful works, which was what I was looking most forward to going into this film. 
Enjoyment: 9/10
Having watched this once in theater and another time at home, I'd personally prefer to watch it at home. The comedy at times were hit or miss for me, but the crowd seemed really into it and it drives the comedy up as a result of the crowds reaction. The dramatic points however, was one that felt stronger at home, and the need to let your emotions come out gets stronger when you're viewing alone. 
Both viewings were still a pleasure to watch. The interactions amongst almost all characters were fun as hell to watch, the OST as a standalone sounds just as great, and there's just tons to talk about post-credits. 
Overall: 9/10
Overall, I enjoyed this movie that had a supernatural concept that is not all that common, with kickass animation and music to accompany the wonderful directing this movie had as a whole. The characters were great, the atmosphere watching it was awesome, and I can safely say that it's one of he best anime movies that I have seen.",9,Weezelone

The story is not original: body swapping is something explored in other works. Kokoro Connect and Yamada-kun both come to my mind. However, the plot twists and how plot points were shown early on made it seem as if nothing had been pulled from thin air. The ending was magnificently beautiful and tear inducing. The drawback was how jumpy some transitions were, mainly in the first half of the film. It confused me once or twice and felt off.

Characters are well developed in some instances but not in others. Both protagonists have fully fleshed out personas, as does Mitsuha's friends and family. Taki's life is less explored, the only person truly having character being his co-worker. Ergo, I can only prescribe this category a 7.

                Your Name is a brilliantly and beautifully made anime. Shinkai is well known for long distance romances, and Your Name is no exception.
The story is executed really well. This is a body swap romance story that shows how Mitsushi and Taki gradually get to know each other by living in each others bodies. It is well paced and shows how their lives interacted and what their daily lives were like effectively. The gradual buildup to the climax is executed brilliantly and was certainly an emotional rollercoaster.
Although I wished there was more character depth. Mitsuha and Taki’s character’s were never really explored, and their motivations and
                  personal struggles weren’t shown much. This certainly made it more difficult to relate to the characters. However all the characters are very likeable and showed their personalities and day to day challenges in a way which is very relatable.
The animation was brilliant, the amount of detail to every scene was phenomenal, from the outdoor scenes, to Tokyo city. This is very similar to Shinkai’s previous films as well.
Your Name is a fantastic drama romance story, the characters could of been explored more but I would still highly recommend this film, especially if you’re a fan of Shinkai’s films.
Any constructive feedback would be appreciated :)",8,attempt1

                Your name is one of the first anime films that I have seen that seems to have substance. Most of the anime films that I have seen other than ghibli films have been films based off anime adaptions already. ""Your Name"" is a rare movie that makes it existences mean something and be more than just another movie.
""Your Name"" is an original movie made by studio coMix wave and I am honestly not fully familiar with their work but their animation is top notch here. Some of if not the best 2d animation and cgi even at the time of me writing this 2 years
                  after the movie was released. It takes full advantage of the fact that it is a full  movie and not a series by featuring some of the most beautiful art and environment design and I could probably write an entire page that praises the design. The sound design and music are also nothing close but perfect in the way that they match the editing and mood of every seen much better than most OST's do. The emotion and mood can be felt in every track and help the emotion go even farther than the fantastic voice acting does.  10/10 art,sound and music
The story of ""Your Name"" is pretty good but is basic at its core. I think that it really helps the enjoyment of the film by not being overly complicated compared to some of the other anime films. It looks like a simple body switch plot but honestly has a lot going on in the background. Side characters and both main characters are easy to like and no character stands out as annoying addition to the cast. Honestly I think that Mitsuha's family and friends are way more interesting than anyone Taki has in his life, but that in no way means they are unwelcome parts of the cast. Miki being the best part of Taki's cast.  Not as likable or notable as something like ""A silent voice's"" cast but definitely better than most anime. 
Overall there is a whole lot to enjoy about this movie as a whole and no particular part of ""Your Name"" stands out to me as something that makes this movie not perfect in my eyes.",10,maxd37

                All I know is that, if I am in need of a rollercoaster of emotions to hit me like a truck, you know that I'll be going to Spotify and playing RADWIMPS soundtrack for this film. This film is... other worldly, something you've never seen before, absolutely stunning and gorgeous but surprisingly full of heart.
Everytime I listen to the score, or think about the plot, or see clips on IG of Your Name edits, I would literally get goosebumps along my arms because the power this holds over me is Legit. This film is just unlike anything I've ever seen before and the epitome of
                  sci-fi romance animation. I loved it. 
I don't want to get to much into the plot because I don't want to spoil, but I think it's best if you go into this film blind with only a general idea of what it's going to be about, so just enjoy the ride and be prepared for anything. Also remember to loosen up! It's not as serious as it seems and have really fun comedic aspects too !
Though I think that the characters are very 2 dimensional at times and you don't even get very much depth from the 2 MCs, I think that the story, animation and overall experience of the movie covers up its flaws. I would have enjoyed more of a personality from Taki though because compared to Mitsuha, I felt like he really lacked.
To conclude, I think this is a mustwatch for everyone out there so don't hesitate at all to watch it. Don't worry about the pressure of loving it or hating it but just enjoy for what it is ! I recommend to watch this movie when you have a lot of time and full focus because then you'll be able to absorb everything better. Remember, no scene in this movie is irrelevant, everything is shown with a purpose. Happy watching !",10,amandont

Even though it felt like the characters particular story was like a loop going towards becoming something good and improved, I think they could have shown more about Taki and their circle also....All we get to know completely was about Mitsuha and her story until her high school. It feels like all that matters in this
                  story is about Mitsuha who wants to go to Tokyo. Though it was not all that bad, but not too good too.

Just finished watching it a little bit late to the party.I got it not really spoiled but since it was so popular all the social media were talking about it and because everyone loved it I decided I would not watch it and mark it as overrated.
But now that I have finished watching it It was not that bad and I can really see the hype at the time it was first aired since the concept of body swap was really the tur-fu at that time like isekai nowadays.
Really liked it tho I m reapeating myself but the story was great but the definition of
                  love is just a little bit confusing to me.
I mean he did touch her while in thee s body but other than that I can t really see why did they fell for each other ? It is just myself trying to figure out what love is and why did he stop having a crush on the other beautiful and kind female. But I did like how no one died so it makes up for all of that.
Thank you to the author for this anime.",8,Longloveking

                I say that it was magnificent [spoiler warning] but when the meteor thing happened I got kinda confused about the timelines but in the end it made me teary so I WOULD recommend to watch this movie if you need some sadness in your life and I was very confused when they started changing bodies cause they didn't tell that the BOY switched with the GIRL but you get used to it when you know who is who. the only thing that was upsetting to me was that IT ENDS ON A CLIFFHANGER AND WHEN THEY WERE ADULTS THEY WERE SO WHEN THEY WERE CLOSE,
                  THEY WOULD PASS EACHOTHER LIKE YEP DID NOT HAVE A ROMANCE IN HIGHSCHOOL AND SAVED EVERYONE IN A TOWN FROM A METEOR WHICH WOULD WIPE OUT EVERYONE IN THE WHOLE TOWN, but 10  all around",10,bi_mama270310

                An Artistic Visual brilliance.
Came through a post on FB some hours ago about this anime film named “ Your Name”. That post had some relatable lines which triggered my soul right through so i downloaded this film right away and just finished watching it, the laptop is in my hands while the credits are getting rolled down and i am all emotional coming straight here to right my emotions about this art. Am literally out of the words to explain the emotional feeling am having right now, dont know where to start, the story, the connection of the souls who never really met, the cinematography,
                  the direction or the story telling or the relatable dialogoes. Everything is all mixed up, i hardly turn up to animated movies apart from some childhood nostalgic ones. This movie took my heart straight away, the last time something from cinema made me like this, it was probably the ending scene from the Dark series or the release of ZSLJ. The rom com genre is not my go through but this animated film has taken my heart, lost in words not able to explain anything further. This movie straight away goes into the elite list of my favourites and probably in top 5 right there with “Requiem for a dream”, “Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind”, the movies that still has my heart to date. I literally jumped out in excitement in the last scene where I kept hoping taki and mitsuha could greet each other and when taki called her from behind, I had a moment like Will Smith who claps emotionally when he finally gets his job as a broker at the end of Pursuit of Happyness.
In a way the thing that connected me with this was the thorough relevance it had with me in some way, there are days when you wake up lost and u have a feeling of searching someone very dear who is lost but never really know who it is and why are u even trying to find them out, the one u never really have met but is still very known to you. The feeling if it is a dream world or a reality, where are u living and what is the difference between them?",10,Shelby07

                Kimi no Na wa is good. It's supremely polished in its execution, not once did I feel they missed the ball on what they produced.
Ahead of you, if you choose to watch this movie, lies a story focusing on two characters, which, while slightly favoring the male protagonist, actually really delivered on its premise.
What premise, you may ask (if you haven't read the synopsis yet)?
A bodyswap episode. Yes, the thing every older family sitcom went through when it got stale. I scoffed as well, trust me.
But, after hearing praise after praise, as well as liking 'The Garden of Words' a whole lot, I decided to
                  sit down and watch this movie as well.
You may also expect fantastic visuals. Not to the point of the aforementioned Garden of Words, but great nevertheless.
Personally I felt the comet to not really fit most scenes it was featured in, but that's mainly me disliking overly flashy things, at least in movies like this one. The movie's score complements most scenes really well, yet I couldn't really get into both the opening and credit songs. As they're both by the same group, I'll just chalk it up to me not liking their style, but it was a disappointment still.
My general enjoyment, or rather my experience while watching the movie, was equally 'alright'.
Kimi no Na wa has everything needed to be named an anime blockbuster, ups and downs included, which more or less keep you on your toes. Sadly, the second third of the movie, after establishing the setting(s) and characters was really boring, and I caught myself catching glimpses at the remaining runtime occasionally, hoping the exciting final act would start kicking in already, like it ought to in a movie so by-the-book.
Lastly, if you've been paying attention, my biggest critique of this movie: the characters.
I don't just mean our protagonists, but side characters as well.
To not spoil things, I'll just state they do not get enough time for any deeper development. Their relationship, as well as their motivations for said relationship seem more like a thing we're just supposed to accept.
Similarly, I only found myself rooting for the two protagonists because, well, they're the two protagonists, and we're supposed to root for them, not because I felt they were a very good match for one another.
The few establishing minutes the movie spares to focus on either of the two protagonists are mainly used for comedic bits, as opposed to showing us how they tick.
Both characters have something going for them at the start (a burden/hobby/something of the sort) which was shoved to the wayside in favor of the plot twist, when suddenly both of their motivations was to just see one another at a point in time where I wasn't even aware they were supposed to be in love, let alone have a crush for each other yet.
I'm aware that a movie can only be so long, but this glaring fault really lessened my enjoyment for the movie's finale, things seemed to happen only because they were supposed to happen so viewers would have something flashy and satisfying at the end.
I was painfully aware that what I was watching was a movie, and as such it lacked a sincerity I was used to from Shinkai's other works.
To sum up my thoughts, I sadly have to rely on what I just said before:
Kimi no Na wa is good.
It's an anime blockbuster, with the same budget as a blockbuster, but sadly also the same shortcomings of one.
I sincerely hope I'll find more spirit again in Shinkai's next work, while I regather my thoughts for this movie, as well as his older works - especially Garden of Words - to see if my opinion of those changed.",8,SpoopsterCH

                I really love how they drew the anime, same as the story line of the two main chars. Overall a very beautiful, way of saying we are all connected, using threads and such! 
I found it really funny the contrast about the girl and the boy, that was a really fun part of it! And then ending was just getting tears in my eyes. I liked the way they tried to make you think, he liked another person, but in reality he already had the person he was looking for. 
I am re-watching this movie tons of times, since I find it really enjoyable, and
                  the artwork is outstanding! A clear 10/10 from me. I didn't want to skip any parts, or make it go faster.",10,Shakingearth

Overall:
I kept this movie in wait and didn't watch it the time it was at full hype but once the hype ended then I picked it up and I would say it's somewhat cute, somewhat lovely, somewhat superstitious, somewhat confusing, somewhat less explaining and a few other somewhat as well. However it is much appealing visually, have much pleasant opening and ending themes. I think it was over hyped or rather the people got carried away with it but if you ask me it would be better if it was adapted into a TV series… I think but I will go on to read it’s source material.
Story:
So how the story begins was appealing to me. At first glance some people like me might get a little confused by what just happened like when they complain about their behavior and all so this adds a little curiosity and once the viewer gets to understand the initial start of the movie (the first 30 minutes of the movie) then it really adds a little attachment to the story... A little. Then comes the “seeking part” or “investigating part” of the movie as to find his other half and why the miracle which was happening suddenly stopped. To tell you about my experience of this “seeking/investigating part” well the journey of “why did it stop” added more curiosity and increased the interest level but again a little and once I got to know the reason why (though I already had the idea why did it happen) well that was a bummer but it came with a shocking surprising detail which I won't spoil and this shocking surprise increased the interest level by a significant margin or simply a lot but also made me a little confused as this shocking surprise is not really common thing in anime (at least for me). Now comes the climax, this part of the movie glued me to my seat and it might be the case with everyone else as well. After knowing why he actually tries his hardest to get the miracle to happen again. The planning, determination, hard work of not only him but Mitsuha’s friends as well was enjoyable but the part which I really liked was when he gets to meet her for the first time. He having knowledge of how less time he already has but he gets carried away with the moment or also he thinks they have enough time. The time when the meeting comes to an end was sad when he actually tries to write her name. When the plan starts to fail I was like… No! Ya he tried so hard. It was very sad once he fails…. That was the impression the director gave but then once I got to know that it worked I was like… Yay! That's good but then the director hits with another sad scene but at least it turned out to be a happy ending.
There are a few minus points which I won't write as it's already too lengthy.
Art & Animation:
The art style wasn't bad at all though I really think the artist should’ve upped his level as this is a movie but nonetheless it was good or rather better and the animation was near best actually.
Music & Sounds:
So firstly the sounds, everything was better and all and also to tell you that I watched the movie in Japanese dub and I liked the VAs work as they all did good in my opinion. Taki and Mitsuha, Okudera and Yutsuha VAs were the ones with most coverage and their work made the movie feel so real.
Now about the music, firstly I'll write about the opening and ending themes. Radwimps actually gave pleasant songs for opening and ending themes as the song relies more on the singer's voice and lyrics rather than the music. I really enjoy the opening song (the movie version and the original version) whenever I listen to it. The ending theme has a sad vibe actually and is much more pleasant to hear than the opening theme.
Lastly the OSTs, well they do have a lengthy list but the scenes could have had better insert songs than they had and if they had it would've elevated the scenes alot and the me and other viewers would've enjoyed and loved the movie more but that's what I think. I'm not saying I dislike those OSTs rather I love almost all of them but what I'm saying is that the use of these OST would've been perfect if they had picked the right track for the right scene and also had included a few other OSTs than they had. The scene having the perfect or rather near perfect track was when he arrives at the town with his friends and the track was “Kieta Machi” and also the track “Toshokan” used for the scene right after arriving in the town and “Ryokan no Yoru” used after he goes alone leaving his friends. However, the scene after he drinks that thing, the track namely”Kuchikamizake Trip” was nice but not perfect in my opinion as I really believe it lacks something either an instrument or something else. Also to say the two OSTs namely “Goshintai” and “Date” could have been used for Violet evergarden as well as it matches Violet's story and would juice out a few more feels but anyway kudos to Radwimps for their hard work. I have watched and listened to all the OSTs present here and I'll say these guys did a great job. I just got to know the lead singer is the same one who sang Banka (Tokyo ghoul live action end credits theme) and I have already given a lot of views to Banka OMV on YouTube and that's above 100. Anyway They might become my top preferred Japanese band.
Characters:
Well the MCs, Taki and Mitsuha were really interesting because of the differences they had from each other like Mitsuha being a girl from countryside and Taki a city boy with the usual urban lifestyle. This depiction of a rural lifestyle and urban lifestyle of their lives was appealing and also have been interesting to me before in other movies and series as well. Though one problem is that why doesn't Taki questions about being in a girls body and just going with the flow same goes for Mitsuha but the movie explains it as she thinks she is dreaming but Taki being an urban boy would not have much superstitious like Mitsuha.
There are other characters as well but they didn't had much screen time so not much to say about them.
Conclusion: 
This movie is a gem for many but not for me but enjoyable though and lovely and a movie recommendable to others as well.

                Beautiful story. I cried, gasped and laughed as if I was having the same experiences as the characters. Even though they didn't dive too deep and you don't get to see or know much about the characters you will feel how they're feeling and you will understand them. You are watching them and it feels like there are no secrets between you; everything, every emotion is clear and is shared with the audience without them saying much. Another thing that made this journey more pleasant was the symbolism and the little details which showed nothing was there just to fill up the space. Overall I
                  loved it and I would definitely recommend watching.",9,aframe

                Some very stunning art sets, and then some very abysmal panning shots that were made of nothing but CG. I really wish they went all out throughout the whole thing because it's very clear that the art team could do something special. The first 20 minutes were spent holding your hand, even though you were left sitting there rolling your eyes as it over explained. Not to mention the countless repetative scenes of a dude being put into a girls body to then feel around that was entirely unenecassary. 
This was a tough film, it has a lot of potential to be something a lot
                  more than what the creators made it out to be, but I feel they squandered the opportunity. I would have loved if the show took on a bit of a deeper meaning with some of the hinting that was going on throughout with the female character, and embraced something of a transgender film. However, we're left with some vague statement regarding love and life that didn't sit well with me. And to be entirely frank, even that was a little bit of a stretch, as the character interactions made you question what was going on toward the end. Overall it was fine.

                A complete entertaining package.
Makoto Shinkai projects are famous for it’s brilliant visuals and this movie completely breaks the record.  Kimi No Na Wa is probably the best project of Shinkai, at least in terms of art.  Those fascinating beautiful scenery will make you dive into the movie. I re-watch it only to see that magnificent animation again.
Soundtracks of this movie are also amazing. There are many marvel songs in between of movies and they plays a great role in creating the atmosphere of energetic, joy, sadness according to how story goes.
Story is simple. It started nicely but went downhill with time but enjoyable
                  enough to keep the attention of viewer from start to finish. 
Characters are also simple. In first 30 minutes of movie they  nicely introduce characters but they fails to develop them further.  It’s hard to feel emotionally attached to any character.
Even with an average story and below average character development  the movie still able to give me enjoyment in whole 1 hour 46 min. The astonishing animation and memorable soundtrack  are the two strong reasons which makes me give it a 9.

                An absolutely amazing movie, probably Shinkai's best movie.
The landscape art and character design were quite breathtaking,
It's quite rare to see such beautifully drawn scenes, even down to the finest details like shadows of certain structures, or reflections. The art itself would probably make this movie worth watching, but as if it weren't enough it also happened to have a melancholic plot, with very sympathizable characters. 
The relationship between the two characters was rather thrilling of a journey to witness, Shinkai somehow knows exactly to pull most of our heart strings. Anyone who hasn't seen it yet should absolutely see this movie. And as though all
                  this weren't enough the soundtrack, by Radwimps made it just about perfect. It's something I listen to a lot, even though I generally prefer more metal tracks. 
Spoilers-
The only thing I found mildly frustrating was some of the plot holes, especially the different-timezone-paradox, though the rest of the movie more than makes up for it.
Either way it's an absolutely amazing watch, and this is certainly one of the best anime films I've seen.",10,Nevermind52
32281,"
                This movie, in a lot of ways, is an examples of how cliches aren't necessarily bad. The story uses many, many cliches common to youth drama films (With a few twists and turns admittedly) but the way it uses them is very well handled and it tells it's story in a very engaging and captivating way. As someone who isn't the biggest fan of romance and teen drama I was honestly expecting to come away feeling this movie is largely being overrated but it ended up winning me over.
The 2 main leads, Taki and Mitsuha are both very likable and well written, and I think
                  the voice actors did an excellent job handling the body switching element of this movie. It's somewhat subtle, but the speaking patterns and general tone to their voices shift enough to be noticeable and the VAs were able to keep it consistent between both characters. A problem some Freaky Friday plots have is that the actors fail to capture these mannerisms quite right, but when it's done well like it is here it really goes a long way.
The story is very good, but something that did bother me somewhat is that there is really no explanation for why certain things are happening, and, without getting too deep into spoilers, there is a bit of an inconsistency at the end that bothers me a bit due to this. I am, however, willing to give this work more leeway with this than I normally would as 1) it only has an hour and 47 minutes to tell it's story and the ""Why?"" behind it isn't so important and 2) it's story is told well enough that it makes up for it.
The animation and OST are both great. It's one of the most well animated movies I've seen in a while, with breathtaking landscapes in particular being a strong point. The music and general sound design of the movie is brilliant. This is a bit hard to get across in a review, but if you want to see an example of HOW to use a great score as opposed to just having a great score, this film is a good starting point.
Overall, I feel this film has earned it's place as one of the most beloved anime works of last year, and it really is something I think anyone should at least give a chance. I, for one, will actually try to check out the Funimation dub coming out this April since I definitely want to give it a rewatch, and while it's hard to tell how well Funi will handle it, if you are on the ""Dub"" side of Dubs vs Subs I strongly encourage you to do the same.",9,DaWootz

                I must say, there hasn't been so much hype surrounding an Anime film in a while. I have finally had the chance to watch this critically acclaimed film and here I am to offer my thoughts.
You really must nitpick to find anything that can be interpreted as negative. I hold ""Your Name"" to an extremely high regard. My one criticism I have for this film is a particular part of story. I’d like to first state, the story in most parts are really well written and captivating. There is a stretch during the middle/latter half of the film where the two main characters interact through
                  different timelines and here is where this film lost points with me. The story in the beginning is solid. The two main characters are ""Taki"" a high school boy living in big city, and ""Mitsuha"" who is a high school girl who is living in the rural area of Japan. It is hilarious, lighthearted, and an enjoyable experience watching them swap bodies and go about their daily lives. About halfway through the movie they introduce the turning point in the plot. This part of the story is a double-edged sword because this is where the story becomes interesting, yet becomes disoriented. As stated earlier, the main characters start dealing with conflicting timelines which at some points, are either not explained well, or unnecessary. Outside of those few timelines, this concept is well written and offer a unique and exciting element to the story.
Not going to go to in depth here, the art and music are the gold standard for how an anime should be created. This film blends beautiful animation in conjuncture with catchy upbeat music that really enhances the overall experience. The voice acting is solid. I watch the English dub version of the film and the actors put on a respectable performance.
Overall Score: 8.5

                Kimi no Na wa or Your Name is Makoto Shinkai's highly critically acclaimed hit and the highest grossing anime movie till date. Your Name is definitely deserving of these achievements.
Story - The story in Your Name is quite cliche but manages to still be entertaining enough through its charm and cuteness. As the movie progresses though the atmosphere gets more otherworldly and gloomy to symbolize the nature of its first climax; yes, this movie has two climaxes. In the later part the movie gets a bit repetitive but at this point it's already cradling you and your melted heart. However, some of the mechanics that
                  the movie uses to tell the story like time travel and soul-switching aren't expanded and explained convincingly enough. These plot voids could lead you to be disappointed but his movie is for the sake of entertainment, not exactly for the plot (but I understand if you feel otherwise).
Art - Really...? It's Makoto Shinkai... that says enough about the art already. Pure 10/10, better than reality, orgasm worthy art. The only thing that falls behind are the character designs as they just feel too anime-esque for the art-style of the setting, not that they are bad, they just don't compliment the background well enough.
Sound - Phenomenal soundtracks that perfectly go with the rest of the movie. The soundtracks aren't many and could feel repetitive but that won't be too much of a problem. The OP is stellar and, in my opinion, only falls behind in the voice of the singer. Other than that the piano and violin will soften your heart to the core.
Characters - Just like the story the characters could also feel cliche but that's what make them relatable. The side characters are also developed thoroughly and don't feel bland with their fair share of screen-time and usefulness. These characters provide multiple perspectives and personalities in their interactions with each other which is just as interesting as the main characters.
Your Name had me almost crying which isn't something normal for me to do or for anime to make you do. This anime is a must-watch even for even non-anime viewers and trust me - you won't be disappointed.",9,space_duck

                This movie is fantastic. The story can be hard to follow, and there are some bastard leaps in logic, but it holds so much weight, tension, and significance that I could set it aside. The animation is beautiful, and the dynamic between our two leads is memorable and heartwarming. The movie has the added benefit of having a great dub. I'm skeptical when it comes to anime dubs, but the characters were great, and the voice actors for Taiki and Mitsuha pulled off each other's personalities very well. The score is good, as is the rest of the voice acting, and even the sound design.

                Kimi ni na wa is a 2016 Japanese animated romantic fantasy drama film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai and produced by CoMix Wave Films. The film was produced by Noritaka Kawaguchi and Genki Kawamura, with music composed by Radwimps. Your Name tells the story about a high school boy in Tokyo and a high school girl in a rural town who suddenly and inexplicably begin to swap bodies. The film stars the voices of Ryunosuke Kamiki, Mone Kamishiraishi, Masami Nagasawa and Etsuko Ichihara. Shinkai's eponymous novel was published a month before the film's premiere.

In addition to the stories that make you upset, the anime done by Makoto Shinkai is always an eye-candy. Of course Kimi no Na wa brings a very beautiful animation. Although the theme this time is not raining like in Kotonoha no Niwa, Kimi no Na wa still presents a very amazing rain scenes. Movement of character was very smooth, especially when the scene associated with Mitsuha and his village. If you feel this review is lacking in detail, I apologize. I myself would like to write more details but fear spoiler because I feel

Some dreams may repeat, their places and structure feeling all too familiar time after time again, only for them to fade into obscurity without a sound, for the last time.
Your Name is interesting in that it poses the question of what would happen if a dream wasn't a dream. It does this through a romantic lens, and shows us a cute story of two people and how their lives are intertwined by dreams, fate, time,
                  etc. But I don't think you need to dive into the romance to relate to the narrative, as the rhetoric is strong enough to burst into your headspace and lead you through your own journey. It may be a story of romance, but it's also a story of self realization. Who are we? What do we want? What are we searching for, and does our life have meaning? Are we searching for a meaningless dream, or are we working towards a life worth living? Could it all just fade away in the end, never to return? Would we find the spark again, if it did?
It's the questions like these that the rhetoric was able to influence in my mind that elevated my opinion of this movie. Surface level, it's a cute movie that I would have fawned over as a teenager. But letting your mind wander through the rhetoric makes this a much more mature and enjoyable watch that I would be more than happy to return to in countless re-watches in an attempt to reorient myself in my own life journey. Maybe I've gone too far into it, maybe that's silly, but that's my interpretation, and I'll stand by it!
Artistically, this is the most beautiful animated film I've ever seen depicting slice of life modern city and country Japan. The artists who made the gorgeous backgrounds have to be commended for making some of the most ""real"" looking scenes of nature, food, lighting, the bustling cityscape, etc. The music accompanies all of this magnificently, and is placed at the perfect moments to deliver powerful emotional scenes that drive it all home.
It won't be a movie for everyone. There's definitely some predictable moments, both from the cliché romance, and otherwise. There's a few plot points that have you scratch your head a bit, and while some are chalked up to fantasy, some are just... unexplained, though you somewhat feel should be. Naturally I also have to include that it has its quirks as a very culturally Japanese piece of media (as all anime does), and for some in my circles this is a major turn off. That being said, I personally really didn't find anything wrong with the movie, and thought it was a complete package with minimal to find issues with.
I think Your Name is a really moving film worthy of all the praise it has gotten, and will continue to get. Definitely one of my absolute favorites, and it's something I would recommend to anyone. Marvelously done.",10,TheNameBrand

Kimi no na wa was spectacular it felt really good at all times
We started with the story, At first it may seem simple, Since you start by presenting the protagonists individually and showing us the different lives they lead, But I loved it as it was achieved in an organic and so natural way to put together the stories of two characters that seem so... Distant, besides that this simplicity with which the film begins gradually becomes more complicated and convoluted and if you have not followed the film carefully you will surely miss a really beautiful and wonderful story,
                  this really seemed to me the best point of the film its incredible story and as it is so well thought out, a story like this deserves in my opinion a 10
The characters do not fall behind, they are all very well carried, all the characters also have a personality that fits very well with the design they have and the way to relate to each other is very natural, if it is true that there were times when you can feel somewhat weird for scripting issues but... But I really liked them even though I don't think they're perfecto, I also think the most appropriate note for the characters is a 9
The art and animation of the film are also incredible, it uses really vivid colors throughout the film, the settings of both the cities and the countryside, the water that looks crystal clear, the palette of colors of this film feels... Live and it's really amazing like this along with excellent animation You feel like everyone in the movie is alive, It feels so good, especially the natural settings conveyed to me a great sense of peace, as I said the animation is excellent, the characters move very well throughout the film and specifically their faces, specifically when they cry they feel really good... I can't give this sideboard another note other than 10.
The OST is also very good, the themes accompany very well to the moments that are lived in the film, especially the singing songs seem really memorable, I am not an expert in music I admit, but the songs chosen for this film have something magical. 10
Conclusion : I can not put another note to this film other than 10, it feels really good at all times, a story that I personally felt evolved every minute that passed, if it is true that it can in some moments be somewhat confusing but if you stop three minutes to recapitulate that has passed on screen you will understand everything (although I was a privileged who understood everything at first while watching the film xD) , some characters who feel very organic and really good throughout the film, a color palette with excellent drawing and animation and a magical soundtrack, I honestly consider this film a masterpiece, I feel like I looked like a crazy fan of the film, but I didn't mean to, but I was very excited when the film was over and I felt really good throughout this. It was amazing and I think this movie is at the level of the big Hayao Miyazski movies And the truth left me speechless when I finished it, I could only say good things about this one for the movie.

                The fact I have given it all 10s might be due to the fact I’m still in the honeymoon period after watching considering while writing I finished it 5 minutes and now have the ending theme playing but it’s brilliant. 10/10 it really gets you invested with thoughts and feelings of the characters. The music especially makes the movie have an extra feel and sense of warmness. Don’t really get emotional of movies and shows often however this got me good.
I can’t really hint any negatives of the movie. I enjoyed the traditional Japanese sense it had with it being set in the country.

So the story is pretty cliche for most people. I always felt this kinda thing will only work for an episode for a series like 22 minutes, but wow did they surprised me there in the middle of the movie.
The animation is excellent. Not gonna lie with that. It looks like a mixed between real life images and anime people walking around them. It works!
The characters are enjoyable. They maybe a bit typical average main characters but they all had some enjoyment to them. I even sometime
                  shocked or cry in some scenes of what happens to one of them. Will they ever meet each other? Will they even know they are there or not? Those questions are floating over my head.

Look, I gave t an 8. it's very good, but it leaves you wanting so much more. I really liked the plot and twists, but it made no sense because 1) the characters aren't compatible at all. I understand their feelings since anyone in the same position as them would do the same things they did, like crying and wanting to find eachother. but as people they didn't have any story together. 2) It feels incomplete. They don't even hug and the ending is open.

                My opinion:
                     Oh my God I just watched a a Masterpiece. I really really liked the Romance, The supernatural aspect and The character development. And the thing that they are not only swapping bodies but also they are from different time and they set out seach each other from their respected times. At some points of the movie I asked myself What the hell is going on?? It was really mysterious plot and animation is God tier. I love this anime. And last scene was
                  something else that they both meet again as adults.
Story:
           The story was pretty good. The story was a bit mysterious that they both of them are from different years if you have to ask yourself that what is going on. In this set out to find each other from their respected years. But there was some flaws that MC was not able remember who gave him the ribbon it was also fair that he didn't recognized her since at that time he didn't knew her.
Art:
       Animation were absolutely gorgeous. I also liked Artstyle of the characters.
Enjoyment:

                After watching the film after it had surfaced online (the poor quality watermarked stream) I became aware that it was to be shown in select Melbourne cinemas. So I rounded up my friends (only one of them had previously seen the movie) & hoped that a cinema viewing would dramatically increase my enjoyment of this film, in which it did.
Your Name has the most gorgeous background art I've seen in an anime besides Hibike Euphonium, the bustling city of Tokyo is transformed into animation without a detail missing, the isolated town where Mitsuha lives is bright & lush. Detail is also placed in depicting the
                  sky as the film's story revolves around a comet.
Visuals of this quality would only be possible with a film budget & because the film is a romance story the detail is not sacrificed on depicting huge fight scenes or characters moving around often.
The weakest aspect of Your Name is it's story. The director, Makoto Shinkai, tends to feature similar stories amongst his works, portraying star-crossed lovers that cannot meet due to some catastrophe or the character's lifestyles changing.
Shinkai's ""Five Centimetres Per Second"" featured a story more relatable than Your Name in my opinion because the couple was separated by the female lead being forced to move far away compared with Your Name which uses a supernatural event to keep it's lovers apart. Not saying that romance shouldn't include supernatural themes but the audience feels a greater connection to media that relates to experiences they may have faced.
I found the story most difficult to follow once the film diverged into different timelines, the director could have made it easier for the audience to distinguish what timeline Taki or Mitsuha were in by changing the time of day or something like that. 
Maybe I'm just stupid but if I can understand what's going on in Stein's Gate, this film could have presented switching timelines in a manner that would be more understandable to the audience.
The soundtrack was also fantastic. I remember feeling shook during the first scene featuring the meteorite (although this is probably down to the volume of cinema speakers) Another standout track is the film's main theme Zenzenzense by RADWIMPS which has a fast-paced and inspiring vibe to it - makes you want to go out and achieve your dreams or something.",9,YuiHirasawachan

                This is my favorite anime film that is not a Studio Ghibli movie. The story overall was very good, and I have a feeling not many other movies will top this except maybe Koe No Katachi. The ending of Kimi no Na wa was very satisfying to me, as it ended up having a good ending. Kimi no Na wa had me on the edge of my seat during many parts, groaning at others, and even at some points had me screaming in frustration. The art was probably my favorite part of this film. I just felt the art was so beautiful, which is a

Along with all this, I really do like the supporting characters and unlike many movies in this genre they stay relevant to the end. This is a really good film to introduce

                The movie Your Name is one of my favorite movies I watched. The movie incorporates beautiful images of places in Japan, and it was interesting to learn about life in the rural area of Japan and a big city in Japan. The story was beautiful as it ended with Mitsuha and Taki meeting each other again after time passed. As I watched the movie, it was interesting how I started to learn more about Japanese society, and how the younger generation in the rural area started to move to the city after they graduate high school. As the younger generation moves to the city, the
                  rural areas have a high aging population, which the government tried to fix. The movie incorporated beautiful songs sang by RADWIMPS, which is something that I listen to every day. The music goes perfectly with the movie, and the meaning behind the song is beautiful. The art of this movie was beautiful. The movie included a lot of scenery and showed the towns of the main characters in detail. Taki’s home, the city, included tall buildings and high technology, while Mitsuha’s home, the countryside, included nature. The movie showed the traditions of Japan through Mitsuha and her family, and it incorporated many aspects that connected with the traditional views of Japan.

                This review contains minor spoilers for the beginning of the film.
We've all seen body-swapping stories before.  From iconic movies like Freaky Friday to more obscure TV episodes and books, it's long been a popular trope, but I don't think I've ever seen it handled as gracefully as it is here.
Your Name has its own take on the premise: One day a Tokyo boy starts swapping bodies with a girl from a small rural town, but just for a day at a time, before switching back to reinhabit their own bodies.  In other similar stories, I've mostly seen this trope played for humor, and
                  indeed there are some good laughs here.
But what really makes the story tick isn't the silly fun, it's the gentle development of the two characters' relationship via this strange means of communication.  It's almost like an old epistolary romance--meaning a romance where the characters get to know each other only by sending letters back and forth--or like a more modern take on the concept such as the Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan vehicle, You've Got Mail.
If that was all Your Name had going for it, it'd still be a really good movie.  But there's much more.  There's a real attempt to place the body-swapping magic in a larger universe, and while it's never fully explained, the screenplay does a great job of making it feel like part of a bigger world rather than a mere storytelling device.
And there's the plot, which goes to some truly unexpected places which I won't spoil here.  There's a point in the movie which splits the story into two halves, as in Jaws when they finally board the boat and set off to hunt the shark.  It's one of the most effective such transitions I've seen in a movie.
The ending is magnificent, too.  Shinkai has a tendency in his other films toward ambiguous endings--a modernist approach which isn't as appealing to the mainstream.  Some will be a fan of that, but I prefer a more satisfying, conclusive ending.  Luckily, that's just what we get with Your Name, which wraps up the story nearly as neatly as possible without seeming too tidy to be real.  I won't spoil whether it's a happy or a tragic ending, but I will say that I left the theater satisfied.
This is still a Makoto Shinkai film, though, and as such it is beautifully animated.  I don't think it ever quite achieved the jaw-dropping iconic beauty of 5 Centimeters Per Second or Garden of Words, but it's still in their class, which means it's one of the prettiest animated films ever made.  The Japanese voice acting is fantastic too, and the sound work really jumps out with one certain sound effect being a defining memory of the film.
It's telling that my only criticisms of Your Name are minor quibbles.  I wasn't a big fan of some of the pop music montages, including an OP straight out of a TV series; this is a major theatrical release, and the opening montage feels out of place and adds a bit of a made-for-TV feel to an otherwise impeccably produced movie.  I wasn't too big on the J-pop songs used in general, and would have preferred a more orchestral score.
The characterization is good, but not great.  The two main characters are well-realized and distinctive, although not incredibly complex or nuanced.  The supporting cast is, of course, shallower, but some of them do still have distinctive traits and even a little backstory.
Some of the recurring themes don't come across as clearly as I'd like thanks to translation and cultural issues; I'd love to see a better-annotated version at some point.
But none of this really detracts from a movie which just works.  Your Name is one of the best and most accessible anime movies ever made, and it might be one of my favorite movies ever made, period.  If you haven't seen it yet, get off your butt and do so ASAP.",9,OremLK

                An anime loved and hated by many. For me, it was an in-between, i loved the whole plot reveal with the future and the past thing but i felt like the Twilight place and the multiple plot holes confuses the viewer. It kind of falls under a Neon Genesis Evangelion situation where the movie expects us to understand the whole concept of time, the mitsubu, the strings and all that super easily but it just gets super convoluted at the final half of the movie. 
Character development kinda sucks in this movie lol. The whole movie builds up Mitsuha's Dad as a massive dickhead to
                  Mitsuha and her family yet at the final moments, he is convinced by Mitsuha to evacuate the whole city? There's legit ZERO Explanation behind how she convinced her Dad nor how the whole city evacuated right before the meteor struck other than LOL COINCIDENCE.

                Kimi no Na wa (Your Name)  promises to be a delight for the viewer, to be appreciated by those who seek romance and intellectual themes alike. It involves the tales of two teenagers, switching each other's bodies and living each other's life for a few days. They grow fond of one another, for who wouldn't having intimately known each other to such an extent? The artwork is fabulous and accompanied by well composed soundtracks. There are supernatural elements in the story in the form of Shintoism and the hereditary power that is passed down to Mitsuha, which is the crux of the plot. It
                  takes a while to truly absorb all the facets of the film, for though it appears a as a simple love story, this is merely a facade. It stirs up questions of identity, gender and the choices one makes in life. The only flaws that I can gather is the knowledge of certain things that should be obvious, such as the gap of three years between their selves and the location of each other's homes.

                Beautiful and intriguing.  These are two words that perfectly describe this film.
Kimi no Na wa. (Your Name.) is a movie by CoMix Wave Films.  And it also happens to be one of the highest rated anime on MAL.  I had been planning to see it for a while, and I finally got the chance to watch it on New Year's Eve.  So it was technically the final anime I saw in 2019.  
Kimi no Na wa. has a very intriguing story, which I won't delve into for the sake of spoilers.  All i'll say is that I was surprised.
                   The story didn't go the way I expected (in a good way), and it ended up being really emotional.  It starts off slow, but after a while, all the pieces fall into place.
The story is also supported by good characters.  They aren't very deep, but they're likeable and service the story well.  While watching, I was able to feel what the characters felt, which is something I don't often experience.  Besides the two main leads, the little sister is probably my favorite character.  She's quite amusing, and she has some memorable lines.
The animation is very good, and so is the art.  Everything moves fluidly and has decent motion.  The backgrounds are gorgeous, there're some really stunning shots in this film.  If I had to offer one critique, it'd be the character designs.  The characters are drawn much more simply than the backgrounds, which I personally found rather distracting.  I got used to it eventually, but it took a while.  
I watched the english dub, so the voice acting was... um... passable?  I won't hold it against the film, but I felt that some of the voice actors didn't fit their characters.  My other major critique would have to be the soundtrack.  This is probably the first big-budget anime I've seen where I've disliked the soundtrack.  The music comes off as rather amateurish, which I doubt it really is.  Everything seemed a little to random and disjointed.  I did like some of the background music though.
All in all, this film started off a little slow, but I really enjoyed it by the end.  Is it a masterpiece?  I wouldn't go quite that far, but it certainly deserves all the attention it's gotten.  8/10
So, would I reccomend you watch Kimi no Na wa.?  Given by how much I've been gushing during this review, I'm sure you already know the answer.  Hell yes!  Even if you're not a big fan of romance, Kimi no Na wa. has so much more to offer.",8,Wicker_Senpai93
32281,"
                i'm not very experienced in writing reviews, so i'll keep it pretty simple.  
kimi no na wa is an amazing piece of art. the animation is amazing. the music is amazing. the concept is amazing. the actually execution of that concept is spot on to it's full potential, which isn't always something guaranteed as i seen with a lot of other anime and animated films. overall, it's a rare gem in film. definitely worthy of the 9/10.
only thing i would say to anyone wanting to watch this is not to expect whole lot of romantic pay off. yes, it is a romance anime, technically
                  speaking, but your not gonna find the same type of close knit lovey dovey stuff you'd see in something like toradora or clannad or something of the nature. it's a movie. 1hr 40 min. you pretty restricted in what you can do in that amount of time vs. 25-50 episodes of content.
that being said, this movie still speaks volumes in such a short amount of time. while i come from a background of a lot of romance dramas (pretty much all i watch as far as anime goes), i can't discredit the sheer amounts of effort and thought that went into the soundtrack, the art, the music. all of that. It's definitely a solid piece in the realm of film making.",9,Kisenon2000

                MINOR SPOILERS
Your name is a beautifully directed anime with amazing art and an average story line. 
Story/plot:7
Makoto shinkai tried to direct and animate a very difficult concept, trying to fuse romance and sci-fi, so its no surprise it didn't do as well on this aspect. The story concept was interesting but there were a few plot holes relating mitsuha and takis relationship. Many users reviewing the movie say the story and plot is unoriginal and clique therefore the movie gets a 3/10, but many other films (anime or hollywood e.t.c) copy similar character stereotypes and it can still manage to be a good movie/anime, body
                  swapping is a very wide range, and just because ""O i've seen Body swapping and time travel before therefore its a bad story, unoriginal and clique"" doesn't mean it has a bad story (iv'e seen more in depth reviews that explain why the story was bad, but the majority just say that one reason).
Art 10/10
The art is absolutely amazing, but people should stop comparing it to ghibli art because they both have different art styles so its very subjective. If you've seen the real photos (or if you've been to the real places) of the areas in the movie, you'll know that the art is surprisingly extremely accurate. Another thing I have to mention is the shading. Animation usually little to none shading because it would take extreme amounts of time to draw the frames or render. But your name paid attention to  lighting, shading and probably some even small details that just makes the movie seem a bit more real.
Sound:9/10
The soundtracks and sound were good just like any high budget movie. But the reason why I gave it a pretty high score was because everything the soundtracks seemed to fill up almost every important part and they also made certain themes for different places and characters , therefore enhancing the sadness and the drama.
Character:8
I feel that taki is the stronger character. He is the one who saved mitsuha anyways. Mitsuha was not a bad character, but she had less character development than taki. Taki was in more than half of the movie while mitsuha was dead, so that would explain why his character has the capacity yo develop more. The only character flaws I found were their unexpected romantic relationship, we are supposed to accept them liking each other without much actual physical interaction with each other.
Enjoyment:10/10
Even though the story had some issues, i still enjoyed myself greatly. It was a very emotional movie (makoto shinkai tends to focus on more of the emotional side) I don't usually like romantic movies but this one hit me hard, so that has got to say something. 
Overall: 9/10

                  development. It's as if it just assumed that the two characters fall in love for some proper reason, and I felt like the movie made you assume this because you fell in love with the absolutely beautiful drawings, and not so much the actual character...
The story is pretty straightforward. It does play with a small emotional connection that has been built with the characters, but it is nothing compared to other anime, because of a lack of character development.
All this said I did like the ideas presented. Destined lovers who are going to just click when they meet... *even if they don't really know each other*
Art:
As inspiring as can be, and for me a person who clumsily tries to draw, heck it definitely inspired me tenfold.
So if you draw, and you have an artblock and like romance things, and somehow haven't watched it (like me until now), go watch this :D
Also the scene composition is also beautiful.
Sound:
It has nice music. It fits and accompanies the scenes well. The voices fit, and is one of the only things that build character in this movie...
Conclusion:
It's good, but not that good
It was a very enjoyable movie, partly because of the art. I can't deny that...
So if you are looking for a quick ""this is nice"" kind of movie, ignore the fact that this is tremendously hyped, and watch it for what its:
an eye-catcher.
If this were a live action it would be like watching those B-grade romance films. It's alright, but not a masterpiece, which is why its current standing, boggles the heck outta my mind.",8,aggronra

                *SPOILERS*
To be honest, the Anime is a masterpiece, the animations, the story and the concept are very good. In addition to them being able to create a great contrast in the lives of the two characters and having an incredible plotwist. But, to be honest, the ending was disappointing, as they just threw the whole evolution of the protagonists' relationship in the trash. Not to be discredited by the end of Mitsuha's city final arc, which was very emotional, with the two characters meeting for the first time and with the salvation of the region (despite being a bit unrealistic, but this its a Anime,
                  not real life), but yes, after the timeskip. It was as if they had stayed with Amnesia, neither of them knows each other, which leaves the ending very unsatisfying and open. Again, the anime is beautiful and very well done, but the romantic outcome of the two, which, at first, is the focus of the film, actually never happened. It's like watching 26 seasons of Pokemon and seeing Ash wake up from a dream where he never met anyone, hasn't traveled and has never been a trainer.",8,RodriRift

                My review of Kimi no Na wa (Your Name):  (Spoiler Free)
I believed that this movie was one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. 
The story I thought was outstanding as two teenagers share a profound, magical connection upon discovering they are swapping bodies. But things become even more complicated when the boy and girl decide to meet in person. This story plot is so simple and yet works so well. I also believe that the art is absolutely fantastic and it blew me away by how amazing it was. It was so unique and interesting and made me love the film
                  even more. The soundtrack was beautiful and the song Sparkle by WADWIMPS was such an engaging and beautiful song. The character build-up of this film were brilliant, not much more too say really about the characters without giving too much away. I think this film is so good that I feel somewhat empty after watching this film and a somewhat nostalgic feeling after watching it and once I have seen it there is no need to watch it again but that's not at all because the film is anyway boring or anything negative it is because the film is too good to see again.
My overall score of this film is a 10/10

                I got to say, I generally don't rate visually stunning anime anywhere lower than 5. So this is basically me saying - I was disappointed but not because of the art, the art was amazing!
I think the amount of hype that this anime received was astronomically high. Which really might have made me felt very much confused by my feelings when I was watching the movie. 
I tried my hardest to love the anime. But I really couldn't. 
The thing that I didn't like about this anime the most is the inconsistency in the flow of the movie. The abruptness that left me feeling unsatisfied
                  and could not fully invest into the characters' struggles. 
I WISH I loved it as it's one of my hobbies to watch an anime and feel fully invested into the story while making a connection to my feelings. But I didn't.
I would recommend anyone to watch it and see for yourself though, it's an interesting phenomenon that this movie received such high praises. See for yourself and judge it yourself :)",4,cairobaby

                I wasn't really satisfied with this story for many reasons:
The story wasn't well made. I mean, all the time they were switching (yes, the story is about that they switch their bodies every day when they wake up and forget the day before) and it was really hard to keep an eye on who is who and where. So half of the film I was confused and thinking about that, where are they and who is who.
Second. The characters are great, but I didn't fall in the story, it didn't make me convinced they are in love. All the time they are changing their bodies,
                  but how did they fell in love with this? 
Third. An ending is just... Nah. It is as you think from the first minute or the reading any review of this anime. I didn't like it, as it doesn't make any sense and it's quite boring and usual expectable ending.

                This film is really one of the best films I have ever seen in my life, the romance, the meaning is unbelievable besides that it represents a lot of Japanese culture about ''Akai no Ito'' (the Asian legend that means ''Red Thread of Destiny''), I didn't waste even a second with everything that was happening, just incredible
----Story 10 : The story is unlike anything I've ever seen in my life and it happens with 2 teenagers totally different from each other in a very similar way to real life, people can very much identify with what happens with anime and the fate of life
----Art 10
                  : The art is simply incredible, the FPS 60 and the resolution that made this anime was incredible, the city of Tokyo, the lights, the traffic, people everything is incredible, these are the few times that I stop second to second to see the scenery
----Sound 10 : The sounds are perfect, properly positioned in moments that will make most people feel emotional, the opening and ending songs are also incredible and exciting, basically describing the story in a melodic way
----Characters 10 : The characters for you to feel that they're real human, because it is in the ''Slice of Life'' category, but you can see that there really is a life, without those characters with totally exaggerated and extremely dumb expressions (Western media also have a lot of that), the characters are remarkable, I have nothing to complain about
----Enjoyment 10 : Basically I don't have a lot to comment on, but I really enjoyed the anime and the message was incredibly clever, I would definitely watch it again in the next months or years

                Mmm, yes. I do enjoy myself some body swap. Your Name was something that I considered to be one of the best films that I have ever laid my eyes (and ears) on. The gimmick might seem stupid to people that don't watch anime, but it works so well with this movie.
Story: The story begins with our main character Taki, and starts off at a good pace. He goes to school, does some stuff, then OH LOOK A METEOR. After that lovely introduction, we see the other protagonist, Mitsuha. The movie actually blends these two in fairly, with it reminding us every so often that
                  whatever they do in each other's bodies affects the next day. 
Art: I loved the art in this movie. The 3D rotation effect worked wonders for this, and should be a good example for those wanting a 3D rotation effect in their movies. Also, the shading is really good and brings out all the random objects in the scenery. I don't know why I focus on those, but I guess I'm just weird. Anyways, the small lighting effects always bring out the mood in a scene.
Sound: The sound in this movie is great. The voice actors do a really good job trying to portray their characters. Whenever Taki and Mitsuha are swapped, the 2 voice actors do a great job trying to distinguish from the louder personality of Taki, and Mitsuha's more serene and quiet personality. Also, the music. I loved the music in this movie, and Zen Zen Zense was a good pick for the ""intro""-ish transition (if 20 or so minutes in is an intro lol)
Character: The characters are not only brought to life with stellar voice acting, but also with great writing. If you were to ask me about a character's personality in this movie, I could probably tell you, with great detail. Even the smaller characters seem to have a personality trait, even if Taki's co-workers are just jelly. Also, that desperation from Taki in the middle just hit me really hard, since it felt all so real. Especially how he would do this to save everything.
Enjoyment: This movie was really enjoyable. In fact, I saw it twice. The art, the characters, the story; everything about this movie was enjoyable. This movie made me feel many emotions while watching it, and is something that I'd show all of my friends, anime watchers or not.",10,Rabb2t

                If you are reading the review to know if it's good or not, go watch it without knowing anything at all, forget this movie even exists and then watch it when you remember it. It's quite possible you're gonna love it that way. Also, visually, it is beautiful, the animation and drawing are on point at all times.
Now, down to business. This movie is a perfect example of how hype can ruin a pretty solid movie. There's nothing horribly wrong with it, I should've enjoyed it like crazy, sadly my mind was always thinking about the ""it's a masterpiece"" promise and it annoyed me because
                  it is NOT A MASTERPIECE.
I dropped it after 45 minutes, I cringed because I knew where this was going. Sure, there's a kinda of twist after that which I found out later, but that isn't enough to get me back. After the first scene, even if you know nothing about the plot, you know how this is gonna end. And, guess what? It ends like that, just like you pictured, hell, even the freaking camera panning to the sky cliché is there.

This anime is a masterpiece. The story is great but complicated. It took for me 3 times to wacth it. I don't maybe i'm too childish and i don't understand the story.

                NOTE: This Review is my same review as my Google Review under alias ""GamerBoi_SAiNTS"".
""Masterpiece"", this is the word with which this movie can only be described. It is my favorite anime movie so far. I mean this movie has the most unique romantic story ever with some of the most spectacular scenes and some of the best soundtracks ever. 
Both the main characters are super likable and the story is really emotional and sometimes funny as well. Story told through body-swapping is the most interesting yet unique thing about the movie. The moment I started watching this movie I immediately realised that this movie is
                  just special.
Everything about this movie is just lovely and the moment you start watching this movie in my opinion the best animation with which it has been made is just breathtaking. Soundtrack is just perfect and my favorite so far in anime movies. But most of all its just perfect. I just love everything about this movie. 
By the end of this movie I had nothing but tears in my eyes and my heart was somewhat heavy with emotions but ending song just filled me with joy and it really difficult to describe those feelings in words. 
You can really distinguish a ""Makoto Shinkai"" movie from the rest of the movies out there and this movie is the prime example of that. I am just really glad that I witnessed this beautiful piece of work and art. Makoto Shinkai made one of the best anime movie of the all time and it's my favorite now as well.

                What can i say about this anime? My opinion is this anime is pretty good. It's not incredible, and also not too much original, but it's beautiful. Beautiful drawing, beautiful soundtrack, good and yes, sometimes sad story, pretty good characters...simply, this anime is beautiful and nice (so this is why 9/10), but it's not something that can hit me right into my brain. I can appreciate it for anyone who love romantic, sad (but sometimes happy), colored and story-focused anime. For me, it's the sort of anime that you watch and fully enjoyed it, but afterwards, in the future, you don't remember it. That's all

Talking about this anime, all that came first is the admiration of how smooth and great graphic this anime has, and that's even stuck on my head over this time after I've completed watching it..
You cannot even forget something which is really important, that is the Opening and the Ending song, which
                  I called it superb due to the vibe I've completely felt. The opening of this anime, which is titled ""yumetourou"" gave me a vibe about the first impression towards the anime itself. Meanwhile, the ending itself gave me something special as though not wanting the anime to be over that soon.. The Ending itself is also a masterpiece that's brought up by RADWIMPS which is remarkable as I see it~

                I cannot express how unbelievable this Anime is. I barely have words to describe it. This is now my all time favorite Anime and I have seen a large amount. 
This anime is about two people, a girl and a boy in high school, who wake up as each other at random times in the week. The movie is filled with love, hilarity, intensity, suspense, obscurity, and sorrow; It is a cinematic masterpiece and I am sure that it will be remembered and watched for years to come. 
Love: 
The love in this anime is not the driving story line, but it is still there
                  to tug at your heart. This is not a silly romantic anime, it is full of beautiful subtleties. 
Hilarity: 
The hilarity of this anime is amazing. It does a great job with mixing hilarious scenes within the main story line. I laughed out loud many times. 
Intensity: 
This is not an anime for someone who just wants a light-hearted viewing session. This is a very heavy story which really gets to you. 
Suspense: 
The suspense within the story is very large. A good Anime has a way of bring you so far into the story that you think that you can will the characters and story to go a certain way. I talked  to my screen many times, willing things to happen.
Obscurity:
There is a lot of ""in the dark"" moments within this story that make you question what is really going on. It doesn't leave you hanging until the very end on the main plot points; it reveals the twists and turns along the way which makes it even more enjoyable. 
Sorrow: 
There are many parts of this Anime where I full-on ugly cried(My cat was worried). I sobbed and I begged, and you will too. 
       This Anime made be love, laugh, think, and cry. I hope you have the same amazing experience. 
Have a fantastic time,

                I will try to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible to ensure a more spectacular experience. So here we go:
Story : 8
The story starts off quite simple; going with the slice-of-life route first. But, as the story progresses, it slowly starts to become a little complex and heartwarming; with time-travel playing an important role in the story. However, how the time-travel process occurs was never explained. But, I'm willing to forgive this flaw for the warmness of the ending. So, an 8.
Art : 10
The art was like candy for my eyes. The smoothness, the fluidity and the right amount of CG impressed me. It
                  did remind me of Studio Ghibli's art style, but that's just me.
Sound : 10
The music really adds the FEELS to the movie. RADWIMPS did a pretty good job with the insert songs.
Character : 8
Though the character development is quite rushed (I mean it's a an hour and a half movie), but it's well-developed enough to actually have an emotional impact on you and to make you care about the characters. I laughed and I (nearly) cried with Taki and Mitsuha. So, I will overlook this flaw.
Enjoyment/Overall : 10/10
Overall, it was an amazing movie. It definitely lived up to the hype and is a masterpiece in my eyes. Of course, there are flaws in this movie but I still think it was an excellent movie. I would definitely recommend this 10/10 movie.",10,GameMaster9000

                Kimi no Na wa. This is a movie that I have been dying to watch since everyone has been raving about it for so long. I know I'm late to the party. But I don't ever think I will see something quite like this ever again. 
The story is very reminiscent of Kokoro Connect in the sense that two individuals, Mitsuha & Taki, both seem to have a very strong connection with one another in ways that even confuse them at first. I'm not quite sure how I should label this phenomenon that befalls both of them, but let's call it fate. The characters are
                  what I would call detailed on the surface, but not too deep. However the connection that is made between the viewer and the characters is deep. This is a daring story that really captures that essence of Kokoro Connect, and uses it in a new way that is simply beautiful and innovative. 
Now I honestly have seen many anime. And many of them have been beautiful in their own ways, whether that would be the beautiful sceneries, or the stark beauty of simplicity. This is more than that. This is truly what you would call a masterpiece. A work of art. I have never seen animation done like this before, and I'm honestly taken back at how beautifully detailed this anime was. Simply a spectacle to watch. As for the sound, I'm pretty impressed with that as well, the stereo imaging is well done and the voice acting is top notch; ost is really good too!
I'm impressed with this movie. Honestly while watching I was thinking to myself more about how good the anime looked rather than what was going on, on screen, that I missed quite a lot. I definitely think this is one of those movies that will need a second viewing to really soak in the smaller details. Overall I'd definitely recommend this movie!

But unfortunately, there are some parts that I don't really understand
                  what was it about. I'll tell this as spoiler-less as possible. Both the main character and the main heroine all met 3 weeks ago but all of a sudden, the story moves fast forward and I feel like, what is going on now? Like how the main character do a research on the place where the main heroine lives but all of a sudden he knows all about it?

                While I was watching this movie, I kept wondering what in the world I was watching. t was so complex and fast that I couldn't follow it. I just couldn't understand what was going on in this movie. A girl and a boy is constantly switching bodies and I couldn't tell if the girl was herself or if she was the boy in her body.
Now, I do not like complex, intense coming-of-age stories like this so I was worried I wouldn't like it but I decided to try it since a lot of people thought it was excellent but I didn't know it would be
                  a coming-of-age story. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but I was still pretty disappointed. It was pretty iffy. It had a fairly interesting story because I like stories that focus on two characters with two different plots and I like the whole switching bodies thing but I just couldn't find myself relating to any of the characters. The characters can be rude and Mitsuha was also cloying. Taki was okay, but not great. I guess he was the only relatively interesting character out of this bunch.
The movie had too much crying in it. The only solid thing about this movie was the animation and the voice acting, they were pretty lovely. Most of the music sounded good. But the writing and the directing just wasn't my cup of tea.
I found this movie to be highly overrated and do not get why people praise this movie so highly.",3,Angry_Anime_Nerd

*note: sensational romance movie where tragedy and conflict happen occurs with a twisted time of fate.""before judging must equivalent fair and adapt of the cultural situation and asking yourself ""why?"" in every aspect"".
Story = the genre took well of its part, lots of climax, moral lesson and cultural traditions involve. Title of the movie makes the whole story intact and suitable of its name, story is simple to understand yet more impact broad understanding for open-minded viewers understanding in each scenes. Tragic of which fiction ""changing time, gender bender,..."" occurs that may lead to reality or make viewers to be confuse in there reality in
                  life. thus culture adapt in the sense of environment that may confuse western viewers if not ""asian"" of the way of living and traditions.
Art= animation details ""effects, 3D style, camera angle, screenplay"" well developed  that leads to create more impact to the environment for the story. smooth rendering of shadow and light particular of changing angle ""rotation"" which editor and staff did there best out of it.""nice job"" suitable for the theme of the story and makes the story not dull and made to apply into such realistic events and makes interesting to watch.
Sound= music composition of each background in every scene makes the mood soothing and relax for the viewers as the play goes. But making the climax weak and lacking in some spot. Character voices ""jpn"" that is played well particularly shows strong and exact emotion and feelings in each character as the art shows by not exaggerating and not ""all talk"" moments partake.
Character= portrait in every character performs with no dull movements but no fail remarks/remorse with only positive interacting moments. Strong impression from the main characters ""Miyamizu-san and Tachibana-san"" which tells us that they are the only one built for the story. While most of the side/other characters you might find shows same personalities which makes them weak and you might not remember them or what purpose they have and slowly being casted away from the story.
Enjoyment: Depends on the viewers personalities and experience in life, romance is the point of the story with a twist of time and fantasy that makes the story interesting, country vs city style and cliffhanging story with a tragedy.
My Reaction: The movie is nice and good to watch, as for me I experience romance in such a way I find it less emotional but sensational, the climax has many scene that will make you wonder and feel mix of emotion whether you will be sad or cry or what so far. The story goes blunt and goes rushing or shorten for the story just to make it happen and some points maybe confusing about changing of the time ""mirai"" and events. ""cant blame it when making a movie has requirements such as appealing, budget and time consumable..."". Watching in serious situation might not ease to be entertaining and confusing but interesting, you might think or wonder ""what just happen or why?"" and also might ask yourself if this movie has/have any series or prequel for this. To sum it all I like it and glad that I watched this movie and thanks for the hard-work making this movie.

The mains go through amnesia multiple times for no reason at all. Shinkai incorporates mystical elements there, however, unlike Weathering on you, these detail only messed up the plot. The story writing is like a tangled mass of threads, not the type that you would love to analyse after watching it, but the type that disrespects your logical reasoning function, leaving you wondering how it becomes a hit. If you think the plot is great, you either are: A.5-years old or B. you forget to think rationally while watching it.

                I won't waste your time with a windy review, so here's the deal.
If you've followed all of Makoto Shinkai's films up to this point, this film will likely feel like worn-out territory. There are many scenes which are practically copy/pasted from his earlier works and the theme and concept is similar. What emerges might be described as a polished and culminating attempt at Shinkai telling a story he has tried to tell in several other films, with varying success. If you've never seen a Shinkai film, you might easily feel ""Your Name"" is a masterpiece. Even if you've seen them all, you might still feel
                  that way, but if you're like me, you start to feel this plotline and concept is going stale and want to see Shinkai explore new ground. When the trailer for this movie came out I recall very distinctly feeling like it was just like all his other movies (exception: Children Who Chase Lost Voices, which only varies in plot by being a Studio Ghibli knock-off), and I was worried by it. My concerns turned out to be justified. 
I think I was more moved by ""The Place Promised in Our Early Days"", but when I saw that film, Shinkai's metaphysical ""connected over time and distance"" concept that he loves to explore was fresh to me and not something I'd seen experimented with much in films before. I tend to feel bored when I see a film that explores a unique concept less well than its predecessors. In this case the uniqueness of the concept feels like a gimmick. While American audiences were raving about how life-changing ""Interstellar"" was, I watched it and felt mostly disappointed by it as it seemed like an unnecesarilly convoluted re-telling of Shinkai's ""Voices of a Distant Star"", stretched out over 6 times the length and with a less heartfelt effect.
I've also seen a handful of other anime that explore the body-swapping idea with much more heft than Your Name. Kokoro Connect's first story arc comes to mind, and Your Name doesn't ever reach near that level of empathy and dramatic intensity. There are definitely missed opportunities throughout the film.
The animation is top-notch and Shinkai's obsession with light and lens flares seems toned down a bit this time around, which at least gives the film a fresh stylistic approach in his repertoire. The lush color pallet is beautiful and fully takes advantage of HD color space. Music is great but there are at least 3 or 4 sequences where the film feels like a music video. One or two would seem artfully agreeable. Beyond that it feels like unneeded filler.
Despite that the film feels a bit stale to me, I enjoyed it quite a bit. The deep connection to Japanese culture and the beautifu scenes that show an immense appreciation for both the city and nature make this film a wondrous experience to sit through. The characters are just shallow enough to make you wonder more about them.
If I was rating this film with regard to Shinkai's other works I'd rate it lower, but if I pretend I haven't seen the others and just rate it independently, I think it's worth about a 9/10. I certainly don't feel it should outrank every anime on this website though or be considered the gold-standard for anime movies.",9,LucentRivers

                Your Name is an original anime movie not based on a manga which is not too common nowadays, this means that the movie won’t like most anime adapted from manga cut out scenes. It’s the first break out movie from director Mokoto Shinkai which surpasses his previous movies that aren’t as well known or liked. 
. The introduction is a great insight into Taki and Mitsuha’s daily life which is funny as they have already switched bodies in the opening scenes.
. The animation is amazing with small details, beautiful large landscape shots of the countryside and crowded cities, lively character animations and I especially like
                  the night skies and comet scene.
. The soundtrack is incredible even though I don’t know what the English lyrics are, the music matches and heightens the emotional scenes, RADWIMPS are incredibly singers and have good background music too.
. The story has many mysteries, twists and turns which upon rewatching some clues are left that you didn’t notice before.
. The characters are engaging and you care for them even the side characters, because of this you want the characters to meet making the emotional climax of the movie amazing and the aftermath heart-breaking.
. Very unique as the characters fall in love via the body swap.
. The voice acting in both Japanese and English fit the characters perfectly and their acting is at its best in the emotional scenes where the actors really help convey how the characters feel at that point in time.
5/5- My favourite anime movie, can’t wait for more from Mokoto Shinkai films and this movie is an essential watch even if you don't like romance anime.",10,Sonnyman45

The art all round was stunning but some scenes could only be described as beautiful, and thankfully the camera seemed to linger on these scenes just long enough for us viewers to fully appreciate its beauty.

                Your Name. sets out to tell a love story that transcends time and space. For this purpose it builds itself on a concept I had gotten tired of the first time I witnessed it on local televsion a long time ago. However it does make good use of said concept - using it to nurture romance over comedy. 
Surprisingly the story actually supports the body swap gimmick, and comes with a really good twist to the experience the protagonists find themselves in. Unfortunately that is about all that makes this movie stand out. Compressed into a 30 mintue episode it would have made a great
                  OVA. For a movie however the story as a whole is lacking some substance. Instead the story tries a bit too hard to make sure everyone watching this understands why the film is named the way it is. And at times it just feels jarring. Important characters have some depth, but still feel rather bland. I suppose there is a reason this film found widespread success. It tells a sweet story in a safe manner that is unlikely to offend anyone.
All in all this is a fine movie that could be good if it was a little less rough around the edges. Characters and plot could have used a bit more fleshing out. The final scene too convenient for my taste. Still a surprisingly enjoyable movie.",6,ryu2k2

Enjoyment: 6
Overall: 6
In my opinion, Makoto Shinkai has always been an overrated director, unable to convey emotions through narration, he often resorts to ""hiding"" behind the skill of the technical sector that supports him.
With ""Kimi no Na wa"" Shinkai created the work that will probably and unfortunately will give him eternal fame, due to the inexplicable success of the film that brought great revenues (one of the highest in Japanese animated history). Thanks to Netflix I was able to see this ""masterpiece"" and I think it is an
                  average film but definitely far from the masterpiece considered by some critics and a slice of the public.
Shinkai does not bring great innovative themes compared to his previous works. In particular, in Kimi no Na wa the loneliness of the man and the bond between the protagonists, a country girl eager to discover city life and a boy from Tokyo with a part-time job as a waiter who dreams of becoming an architect. What do the two teenagers have in common? Well, 2/3 times a week due to an inexplicable phenomenon they find themselves in each other's body.
Personally I find that ""Kimi no Na wa"" is a much more commercial film than Shinkai's previous works.This desire has perhaps played in the author's favor, as it has smoothed out some of his flaws (not enough to justify its success). For example, he reduced the unnecessary animations and ""discovered"" that the characterization of the characters is important, even if defining it as such is perhaps too much since, beyond the two protagonists, the remaining characters are comparable to mannequins in terms of charisma. The two protagonists live in a state of continuous dissatisfaction, wishing to be elsewhere but remaining undecided on what to do. Shinkai takes advantage of Japan's idyllic tradition and vision to please the public.
The animations remain of a great level but alone they cannot make a film, there must be an adequate plot and in this case it is not so, but on the contrary it is a story that is sometimes too long and forced. Even the OSTs are of an excellent level and accompany the events that follow each other well. 
As already said, Shinkai with this film ensures a place in Japanese film history that I think it does not deserve because we are talking about an average film and nothing more. However, I believe that Shinkai with this film has made significant steps forward compared to the previous ones.
In conclusion, I am convinced that ""Kimi no Na wa"" was saved with the great quality of the technical sector that between OST and animations manages to ""hide"" the numerous inaccuracies in the plot.",6,Risto__32

                I have a single confession to make about this movie. It's too short. I've been watching 12 episode series, 24 episode series, for too long now. I needed more. I'll probably end up reading the manga and really enjoying them. 
I'm not sure how they could have adapted it better, but there is so much more I could ask, so much more I know deserves to be explored. The romance of the two main characters seems at least rushed in movie format, but I'm sure that's because there was no slower way to develop that. That's why I give character a seven. The characters are
                  great, but we aren't seeing all of them, or even really that much of them.

                Kimi no Na wa.
Your name.
After such a long time I could hardly resist the curiosity and dared to watch this film  to see if it really is the ""masterpiece"" everyone is talking about.
I found the film very interesting without a doubt and watched it with excitement and curiosity until the last minute. Would certainly look at it again in years. A very pleasant film. The animations are stunning, the music satisfactory and the characters average. The topic and the implementation was also attractive and appealing.
But this also ends, because the film not only had highlights but also weakened abundantly, which the optics and melodrama tried to undermine.
The characters and their relationship have been horribly rustled and it's hard to understand why they have any kind of relationship at all. Many of the scenes were drawn out immensely or crammed with irrelevant scenes that had no relevance to the characters, viewers or the plot.
The actual plot had almost no beginning and was explained rather weakly towards the end. Everything is left to the speculation of the audience for the ""how"" and ""why"".
And of course the last 10 minutes of the film. Not only that everything was built on it, no you also prepare an open ending for the 2 characters without any scenes. What did you wait 15 minutes for at the end to see the end result? Practically reminds me of the scene from ""John Schnee in Season 8 of Game of Thrones, in which the truth about him was actually revealed but the scene is skipped ice cold"" - right on the same level.
""How do the characters react""
""How do you get it again""
""What will become of the two now?""
- None of that.
The main thing was to see people walking for minutes and watch trains. I could hardly have come up with a more unimaginative ending. Is by far the worst case scenario of an open end.
The film is well worth watching, however, but this is only thanks to the studio. If the film had been released 20 years ago, it would certainly not have experienced such great hype, as most of it went into animation and musical support. In the area of ​​action, it is only half-baked.
Genre
Most of the genres have been sloppy work. There was hardly any humor. Drama was average as the characters were too superficial. Mystery and supernatural are generally meaningless if neither an approach nor a conclusion has been found. It is difficult to speak of a mystery that one has not even tried to uncover. And the supernatural part of the film wasn't explained. Some hints about gods and a shrine, but this is by no means sufficient as an explanation.
Story
I certainly like the approach to the plot and the tension was maintained almost to the end. However, there was far too much lack of detail. You cannot create an action and simply exclude any possible explanation. The main thing is that you saw the characters in the anime run for around 8 minutes. And 4 minutes of how he / she touched his / her breasts. Every minute could have been used to give this plot the perfect finishing touch.
Animation / pictures
Considerable. I always let myself be carried away by good graphics or animation and here my mouth watered again.
Environment, lighting effects, motion animations and CGI cars - apart from the latter, everything was unprecedented.
Characters
It's a shame, especially here so much potential and scope was lost. If you were asked what you think of the characters in the film, you couldn't give an answer. This is because the 2 characters were only half-finished comedy interludes. There was neither real personality nor depth of character. Worst of all, I think, was their exaggerated and questionable relationship without any approach. Perhaps this could have been expanded better with more time.
I don't hate the characters, I didn't find them off-putting, but neither did I find them likeable. It was hard to feel for the characters.
You couldn't get anything out of any of the supporting characters.
Music
It has certainly been satisfactory. Nothing earth-shattering, but the atmosphere was well underlined by the singing and the east.
Conclusion
Your Name is a decent  Movie and I liked him pretty much, I don't want to deny that either. But they could ""clearly"" have made more of it. This Title is only half finished in every way.",6,Resting_Bonfire
32281,"
                Almost 5 years, to the day, has gone by since the release of Your Name, and today, I watched it for the first time. After all, I heard so much about it that I had to give it a watch.
My grading criteria: Story: /25, Art: /10, Music: /10, Characters: /20, Enjoyment /15, Comedic & Romance themes /20
TLDR: It is a straightforward, rather generic movie, but that doesn't mean it didn't have its share of wonderful symbolism (the trains), its heartfelt moments, or its lesson of a hopeless, distant love, that some of us folks might face in a different sense.
STORY: 19.3/25
A little predictable, but executed
                  decently. The reason for the somewhat lower score is that the movie doesn't do the best job of keeping viewers emotionally attached with the characters. I can see casual anime watchers easily giving it a perfect score because of its attempts at touching and emotional scenes. I constantly tried to find a source of motivation for the characters, but could not find a logical conclusion. Furthermore, I found it confusing at times, though I did understand everything at the end. I would have wished it got into the main plot a little earlier in the movie, but I understand the concept of ""setting the stage"". This doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the story, even with its flaws.
ART: 9.4/10
The production design and animation were exceptional. Use of turning cameras and beautiful scenery made even the most predictable of scenes emotional. The contrast of colours and the depth of every frame was well done by Makoto Shinkai.
MUSIC: 9.2/10
RADWIMPS does a solid job with the sound. It only added to the experience of watching Mitsuya and Taki's journey.
CHARACTERS: 15.5/20
There is a definite lack of depth with the characters and the development might not be entirely there in just a 105 min movie. The main characters I have no huge complaints about them. However, the problem that I did have with them was the lack of exploration we had with them as people. We see where they live, their friends, their work, and the basic parts of their lives in the first 20 minutes and I wish that we could have seen more in order to feel that emotional attachment to them, as I'm sure that that was the goal of the movie. On the good side, the characters appeal to a big chunk of the society as it reminds us, or tells us about the magic of youth.
ENJOYMENT: 13.5/15
COMEDIC/ROMANTIC THEMES: 14.5/20
Much like as I said earlier, I struggled to find what motivated the characters to do such things, or why they loved each other in the first place. Perhaps it's the emotional attachment they had to each other in living in each other's bodies, but the romance was handled rather simplistically, and therefore a slightly lower score here as well.
OVERALL: 8.14/10
Well, no tears from me, but I could see the wonderful symbolism about youth that we saw from all the train scenes. A distant, impossible love, that diverges just like the comet, but can converge because life is so complex. Beyond the problems I mentioned, this was still a solid display of how important memories are, and how we should treasure them.",8,Mcsuper

                The films initial plot of a 'body-swap' romance type of story isn't anything new and the premise has probably been done to a better extent in other films and series. However, it is how the body-swap element is used that makes the show unique. Some may complain that the show is broken in places and leaves them feeling confused, but I don't see it that way; everything is made reference to within the film and is explained all that is required from the audience is to pay attention and absorb what is going on.
The Art of Kimi no Na wa is beautiful, probably the best
                  art for an Anime I have ever seen. There are no dips in quality and the art is consistent throughout the 1 hour 46 minute run time.
The OST and main theme fits incredibly well for the tone of the film giving it some life when it needs it the most. The voice acting is really good and there is never a dull moment when the characters are speaking. 
Probably the worst thing about the film is the characters. While I feel that the female main character is probably the shining light within the story - the way she is written and her backstory makes her the best character in the film itself. In terms of the male main character, from the beginning to the end we know very little about him apart from his name, where he works and where he lives. No backstory is given to the character and while the voice actor did a brilliant job, I feel that he is a pretty generic character which only starts to shine when the main female character possesses his body. 
Outside of these two characters, there are only about three other characters that are worth mentioning - the granny, the little sister and the female crush - apart from that everyone else is pretty throw away.
In terms of my personal enjoyment, for Kimi no Na wa, as soon as the film had finished I found myself fighting the urge to restart the film and watching it all over again. It is a film that probably requires the watcher to see a couple of times just to process the story and connect the dots within your head.
I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, even if some are let down by the story, it is still made an enjoyable experience simply down to the animation quality and sound quality which help me to put the overall rating of the show at a 9/10. It doesn't receive a 10 from me because nothing is ever perfect, and Kimi no Na wa is not perfect either, but I feel that it is the closest you are going to get in terms of the perfect Anime.",9,Evil127

One of my mates was trying to get me into anime with these recommendations, and they're good picks for sure. But personally I don't really see the ""wow"" factor that makes this film so great. It's a decent love story with an interesting hook - swapping bodies. Like freaky friday but a romance lol.
I liked the city vs rural comparisons, that was fairly interesting. The animation, sound etc. are top notch, very good. the music is very nice and fits the movie well.
Whilst I think I'm a sucker for
                  romance this movie didn't really pull me in as I had been expecting.

BUT! I got to say I love all the music in this movie. If you haven't seen the live performance of ""sparkle"" I really suggest you watch it on youtube. 
The characters are fine but I wasn't really attached to any of them. But the biggest problem I find with this movie is the ending.

The soundtrack was amazing and really elevated the experience. The swapping between their perspectives and the build-up to them finally meeting is done so well. I can see why Your Name is praised so highly because its animation is truly breathtaking and its story was presented really well.
The movie has two main phases and I loved the way it
                  was done. It transitions from them having to navigate a stranger's body to a rescue mission so that they can meet each other after forming is an unusual but very strong bond.

The characters. Well, they are self-inserts on steroids... F*cking hell, they really have ZERO personality traits. They are clean and empty, you get to know nothing about them. Because of this their romance was completly unfounded. Why did they love each other? What did they love in each other? We got a half-baked explanation: Fate. Well, that's not much, but it's honest work, I suppose. That's the recipe for a short relationship with a quick broke up. That's the future of them together.

The soundtrack gives a good impression and atmosphere of the movie. The animation is fluid and the art is aesthetical.
What I don't like in this movie: The Story and Character
The likeness of something depends on how memorable the something is. And this what the movie lacks. It start with a chill 'Slice of Life' genre and ends with a confusion on how the plot is going on. In short, it is not memorable.

                Positive thoughts: The art in the movie is one of the best thing I have every looked at and even though I did not like this movie was visually pleasing to look at and I can see way people really like. I also think that Miki Okudera was cute. 
Negative: 
1. The twist in the movie ruins the movie for me. The twist in the movie is that there were not just swopping bodies but also time traveling and that Taki was time traveling 3 year into the past and Mitsuha was time traveling into the future. This twist does not work because technology change
                  every year and the movie has phones in it. The phone in the movie look the same when they should be different. 
2. If a comet distroy a village I think that Taki would have Hurd about it in the future. Maybe he would have cared about it but I think that he would have Hurd about it. 
3. We do not know much about the character and there relationship in the movie just feels out of know were. The character also do not act like themself when they are each other body’s. Do you really think the Taki would kick desk around in his own body. If not then why do you think he would in Mitsuha body. We also do not know much about the character future and what they would like to do with there live. Now I am not say that every character needs to do this but  Mitsuha In the movie say that’s she want to be reborn as a to Tokyo Boy and do want. Taki does not fair much better because the only he grows up to do is to be an architect because he was agile to remember what the town look like and not it’s name which does not make any senes because if you can remember the town so well that you are able to remember it and draw it from memory then you can remember the name.

                This movie really helped to give a creative spin in blending romance and supernatural genre together.

This movie has a lot of aspects to draw people in. Kimi no Na wa has romance, supernatural elements, some time travel. They all come together to give a very impactful and interesting story. The movie doesn’t drown on too long and doesn’t grow boring. The movie opens up immediately into the plot which cause viewers to question what
                  is going on causing them to become engaged in the story and wonder where all the plot points are going.

                I went into this movie relatively blind, merely knowing that a Tokyo boy and a country girl were body-swapping and trying to figure out who the other person was. So the first quarter of the movie followed my expectations but I did not expect the primary story element. It came as a huge shock to me and made me cry like a baby.
The end of the movie in present-day was a little frustrating but it's justifiable, plot-wise.
The art and scenery were beautiful, as is expected of Makoto Shinkai. To me the story was original and was a melancholy but good ride nonetheless.

                Basically when you say “Anime movies” one of the first things to come up is Your Name.
This movie has made has made quite a name for itself since its release and after watching it, it is no surprise why.
The story surrounds two teenagers, a boy and girl who, mysteriously, swap bodies with each other simultaneously day after day.
They say this one is a romance but to be frank, there isn’t much elements from your usual romance in this one, or so I feel like. It did have some good emotions. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t jerk any tears.
On the other hand, the
                  music was great. The piano and the soundtrack all blended wonderfully to the jaw dropping animation.
In terms of animation, its one of the best I have personally seen. The movement is so natural and the lines are so clean and just, beautiful.
I do have to say the plot does leave the audience woozy every now and then, taking some buffering time to process what is going on.
Overall, excellent movie. It’s a lovely celebration of cinematography and animation. A fabulous ode to Japanese culture as well.
Do I think the hype for this is worth it? Not quite. Although great, I didn’t find a lot to call this one extraordinary.

The animation is beautiful with few flaws, the plot is very interesting and can pull anyone into watching regardless of what genres they prefer. The two main characters are very likeable for many people watching due to their differing personalities. I really enjoyed the movie as a whole because it shows how two different people can be connected deeply with such ease. The ending is also a surprisingly nice cliff hanger, leaving room for the viewer to theorise what happened afterwards.
Overall this movie
                  is great and is worth watching.

                In some ways this movie was almost exactly what I expected, but the unfortunate thing is that I felt like it fell in line with my expectations a bit too strongly to the point where I didn't really feel any particular moments that really outright impressed me at all. Practically everything about Your Name feels very tropey, fitting into the same category of the multitude of other Japanese animated movies that come out on a regular basis, albeit all being very nicely executed on most fronts to put it that slight cut above a lot of them. I found this particularly true with the art,
                  giving off an almost dreamy vibe at points and occasionally giving some room for some genuinely cool bits of visual creativity that enhanced the overall experience quite a lot. 
That said I still wasn't completely sold on the film despite this, as while a lot of this was clearly aimed towards delivering a character driven narrative experience, the characters were funnily enough one of the least interesting parts to be found. None of the characters really feel as if they have any sort of meaningful growth and when the movie hinges on the dynamic between the cast and how it changes between swaps, it ends up feeling unengaging as a result of all differences between the two characters feeling very surface level, with no real depth to any of them.
In terms of plot I felt quite similarly, as while there were quite a few twists thrown around to elevate the tension of scenes and build towards the climactic final act, a lot of the time things felt rather slow without contributing much to the overall atmosphere or liveliness of the settings beyond once again, the more surface level things. As a final note, the soundtrack in this was genuinely awful and singlehandedly was able to ruin a significant amount of scenes, with the stereotypical style of rock completely killing the tension all over the place and replacing it with really sappy melodrama. 
Despite all my negativity in this review, I still liked this movie to some extent, simply because while it's safe and doesn't really have anything that really provokes any thought beyond a few needlessly convoluted story beats, it's ultimately very competent across the board and is able to somewhat create interest through its art. Give it a watch if you're one who quite enjoys a lot of the common tropes for this type of movie, because this movie does tropes really well, not even in a negative way, just depends on how much you enjoy that sort of stuff to begin with.",6,Kempokid21

                Story: 10
The story is absolutely top-notch. There are so many twists and turns, and little details that makes this so rewatchable. I also found a lot of religious applications outside of what is touched on outright. If you're looking for a movie full of hidden metaphors that you won't get till your eighth viewing, this is for you.
Art: 10
This movie is beautiful all the way through, but from the second act on, it's even more stunning. At the beginning of the third act, there's an extended sequence that looks otherworldy. So beautiful.
Sound: 8 
The music is good in Japanese and in English. The English dub,
                  when they're speaking, is not good. In Japanese, the jokes are actually pretty funny, but in English they appear lost in translation. Also some of the impressions in the English dub are a little offensive in my opinion. But music: everything about the music is great, especially the background music.
Character: 8
I relate to the two main characters, but they do both feel like the same character. (Maybe that was intentional.) Very easy to put yourself in their shoes, as they try to do what's right in the face of crisis. Very heartbreaking at points. The minor characters feel real, except for maybe Taki's friends. Mitsuha's friends, Mitsuha's family, and Miss Okudera all are good. 
Enjoyment: 6
I love this movie, but I haven't seen it in two years for one reason: There's a few scenes that are very perverted, but I don't feel like I can skip them, because they do apply to the plot. It just makes me feel icky. That's hard enough to look past that my final score is a...
Overall: 7
Great. Watch it once all the way through. On rewatch, maybe skip over the weird parts. The impact in the climactic scenes are so impressive, and the plot twists also catch you by pleasant surprise.",7,PotatoPeeler68

                Your name was definitely my favorite anime romance movie, other than Umibe no Etranger which is also very high up there. This movie did not feel drawn out nor did it feel overly simplified. It included psychological and time-related things that I found to be very interesting. It was took me a while to piece the whole story together, and that made it very enjoyable to watch because you did not fully know the point of the story until about halfway through. The characters were like-able and the storyline felt relatively realistic in terms of the way that the characters acted. The romance in it
                  was insanely cute, and the ending was really satisfying. The whole movie kept me captivated and I really enjoyed it!",9,jamaycanmecrazy

                There may be spoilers and I am sorry if it's there.  It may be something that's just unavoidable 
Story: 7.  It's a twist on romance dealing with the red thread of fate.  I'm not one for romance but the story doesn't play it out too in your face.  Still I didn't even know what the story was until midway.  It seemed like it was going to be slice of life and then the switching of the bodies; from there I just assumed it'd be a funny little adventure but no. . .the romance and souls and the such.  Might
                  be contrived especially when near the end. . .spoilers happen but overall it was good enough.
Art/Sound: 10 (art) and 9 (sound): My god is that beautiful.  The art design was breathtaking, truly beautiful that at some spots I just focused on the scenery.  The sound also was amazing; it added to the scenes and never detracted or went overboard.
Character: 5.  I don't know if that's a mean score but the characters were fine.  When they switched places it was funny and we do get insights onto them; Mitsuha is a young girl who's tired of living in Itomori because it's a small town in the middle of nowhere with nothing going for her (which is relatable for some).  I wish I saw more of what she's interested in and more on her but of course the shenanigans of the switched bodies done by montage.  Taki is just dumb for not writing his name down on Mitsuha's palm.  Okay that aside, he's okay; typical boy who's father isn't around.  Again I want to know more other.  I know he's blunt and determined but maybe a bit more would've been nice.  Then again the focus of the movie was their love in the form of switching bodies and growing so I don't fault it that much; the background isn't that important.
Enjoyment: 7.  I put a 7 because I was definitely into it.  Some parts near the end got me angry and gave me anxiety but it shows that i'm just real into it and got invested.  It wasn't amazing but it really was quite good.  I knew they were switching bodies from the first scene so I wish they maybe could've done something to hide that better but I'd watch it again so that means I enjoyed it enough
Overall: 7. Like I said above it was real beautiful and I was invested.  It had problems and may end up being illogical, contrived and the likes but I liked seeing the red thread of fate shown in that way  and all confusions aside in the beginning and the anger and anxiety I felt in some parts. . .definitely a treat to watch",7,Bookloner

                I tried my best to look past the Animation and the Music. (It was my re-watch, so I was careful from the start)
Animation- 10, Sound- 10
I don't think anyone would even have to consider the score before giving it, it's crystal clear. These two things are the reason why my rating can be called biased (but it isn't completely, as for the reason, look at the Enjoyment section), cause well, the animation and the music is so good that it's just.... you understand. The animation was fluid too, like Studio Ghibli's and I even liked the voices of the characters.
Story-5
Many may argue with me about
                  this score. But I think 5 is the most fair score to give. The plot uses time which frankly would have dampened my spirit. Travelling in future and past is a really convenient idea and to take advantage of that feels like cheating; I am not sure if anyone feels like it or not but I do. But to add variation, Makoto Shinkai did quite a witty job. However, here too I have complaints like lamely, totally lamely explaining how 'the other half of the plot' works and that annoyed me much. If this was all, then it was worth 5 but fortunately, that was not all. I am talking about the ending. Frank, only the ending made me feel emotional, no matter how little, throughout the whole movie and I think it was an awesome ending. 
Characters-4
Not much to say here. No character development and the characters were just normal, that's all.
Enojoyment- 6
While I was watching, I felt full, I felt like it was an awesome movie. Then I finished it, closed the laptop and went to sleep and woke up, then right at that moment Your Name. didn't conquer my heart as much as it did the night before. If I just wasn't absorbed by the animation and the sound, then maybe it wouldn't have felt that great to me the night before. But I didn't even have to think if this feeling of the night before was wrong or not, I just woke up and I understood. 
But still it did its job nicely, while watching, both of the times, i was completely swept by it and felt emotions it wanted me to feel. So, if you want an 2 hour ride of simple emotions i dont think this would be a bad choice.",6,wasikgcrushedbi

                The art style is amazing! It's simply the best art style I've seen since Your Lie In April. It is beautifully made. 
The story 
The story is good. Very confusing though. I didn't get what was going on the last 20 minutes, but it somehow made sense after that confusing part. It made me almost, very nearly cry too! 
The art
Like I said before, the art is amazing... It is the best!!! 
The sound 
The music was good. It didn't captivate me though. And the voice acting was good. It made sense for the voices to change when the characters body swapped. 
The characters 
Okay, here's the part where I get serious, and judgemental. The characters don't do much to be honest. Like the main characters do most of the work, not the friends or family. They're not developed well enough to call them characters. They're just nobodies, I'm afraid. I don't hate it, but at least develop them well enough to call them characters. 
The enjoyment 
Although what I said about the characters is true in my opinion, it's an enjoyable watch. The art style is and always will be beautiful. No matter what anybody says; it's beautiful... 
The overall 
Overall, it's an amazing film, you should watch it just for the art alone!",8,knd944

                It's overrated. Yes, nothing but overrated. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who prefers logic over the magic of gods or something. If you want to watch a romance movie then you should go for it. 7/10 for romance anime and 5/10 for me.
After watching this movie these are my ratings:
Story deserves a 3:
The story was not good. I could not swallow the ending of this movie. It created a whole freaking paradox in the end. Even if I ignore the fact that this movie broke every rule of physics, well the story still gets a 2. Was it emotional? no, not for me. I
                  don't particularly hate the 'Drama' genre but I can't swallow stupidity and stupid acts can't make me enjoy an anime especially if it's not a comedy. The story became unbearable during the last 30 minutes.
Art and sound deserve a solid 10:
I will admit the animation was godly. It was beautiful but was the reason I gave the story a 2 (The godly animation made the story look meh). Every single frame of this anime can be a desktop wallpaper. The same goes for sound and intros. I loved it all.
Characters deserve a 3:
Yes, the characters were NOT memorable. The mc is a normal high school boy with a sort of cringe character (at least for me) and the same goes for the girl. The thing that pissed me off the most was the sunset scene, I lost all love for the mc. 
Enjoyment gets a 4 from me:
I enjoyed the art and animation of this movie BUT the story was meh and the characters were just ok for me.
Overall it's a 5/10 for me. The twists were meh. I would have given it a 7 if the story hadn't bored me out. There were some heart warming moments but there was nothing that made me cry in the entire anime (Point deduction as everyone states that it is an emotional anime). I prefer story more than the art and animation",5,Reaper_Sensei

                Your Name. is the first anime that I review, I think, and that's a very adored anime almost all over the anime community, from what I've seen. I haven't read the visual novel, btw, so the review will solely refer the film.
Your Name. is a romance/drama(/fantasy?...) film, that follows a Tokyo boy named Taki and a small town girl called Mitsuha, as one day they woke up one day and found themselves one in the body of the other. I won't spoil anything, but I'd generally say that this film is about the bond between the both of them, and bonds in general.
I like a
                  lot of things about this film, and I'll start with the thing that everyone who've watched this film noticed - the animation. This movie is simply stunning, visually. It looks so colorful and vibrant, and I really like the animation's aesthetic. (especially in the opening shot and in the surreal scene with the red string)
I've also enjoyed the plot, overall - it kept me interested, it has some interesting concepts in it, and I like the overall structure of this film. The string/line motif is quite cool.
The soundtracks slaps, too, and it really fits the tone of the movie.
Now, I have like one major issue with this film, so, yeah.
The issue - Taki is criminally underwritten. Like, okay, the viewer can pick up on some things that we're only shown briefly to gather info about his character (which is another praise that I can give this movie. In a quite subtle way, the film shows us from time to time info about Taki or Mitsuha's personality. I appreciate it), but like, come on. He really feels underwritten and underdeveloped, and even the subtle stuff that we're shown never really gets discovered during the movie. It doesn't mean that he's a BAD character, but I feel like the movie could have dived more into his character.
So, overall?
I like this film a lot. I had fun watching it, it was beautiful visually, the message and motif are cool. Taki is really underwritten, which really takes this movie down, but Kimi No Na Wa. was generally interesting for me, and I had a goot time. I'm feeling a 7.5/10 on this one.",7,Shilo_R_A
32281,"
                The only reason I didn't give this a 10/10 was because not everything was scored a ten but this movie was outstanding. So let's break it down shall we.
Story:
The story is complex, I'm not going to lie, but if you understand it, it is beautiful! The plot is so bizarre and chaotic that it gets the message of the movie across perfectly - love is love and you'll always be connected to your soulmate. That, however, is only one of the themes of this movie. Another being carrying and honouring on tradition as portrayed by Mitsuha. Something her grandmother says as well can be summed
                  up to we're all connected (shown by both Mitsuha's red string and how her and Tali's life intertwined) and I would like to add that it's tradition as well that connects us.
Art:
The art is gorgeous! Both Mitsuha and Taki's character design is softer than most anime I've seen. Their soft design sets us up for a touching story. The artist also brings a lot of detail into the comet scene, making it stand out to us. Each aspect of both Mitsuha and Taki's life that play a significant role in their lives are drawn much sharper than a once off scene. SPOILER : the scene when they meet at sunset is absolutely gorgeous. The colours used to shade the setting sun is honestly one of the most beautiful skies in anime I have seen.
Sound:
You guessed it. I lived the soundtrack of this movie. Not only was it gentle, tugging at your heart strings, but it also didn't include many instruments. This almost acoustic soundtrack focused more on the voice and emotion, giving you a more intimate experience with what was happening in the scene. Instead of taking your attention away from the scene, it added more emotion to it, captivating you even more. The song's acoustic vibe also make it seem more clean, giving you that impression of innocence and happiness.
Character:
Though there wasn't much of it, it was interesting to see how the characters behaved in the other person's body and how they helped them. They slowly grew more accustomed to eachother's lives and worked together to better it. While not much character development happens to Mitsuya for reasons I cannot say, it was definitely amusing to watch her adjust into a boy's body in the beginning. The same can be said for Taki in Mitsuya's body. The most interesting part for me was watching how Taki, who was described as tempered in the beginning, actually became much softer as the story developed. He's temper is still evident in Mitsuya in a scene but it's not as bad as it seemed since Mitsuya did wake up in his body with a bandage on his face due to his said bad temper.
Enjoyment:
I don't know if you can tell, but I enjoyed this quite a bit. The story line was definitely something I haven't encountered before and I love the way the story is all over the place and yet connected to the point where it all comes together in the end. There are moments where you cry towards the end of the movie ( unless I'm just a cry baby) because of reasons I will not say but it tore me apart. This is definitely one of my favourite anime movies.
Conclusion : 
This movie has excelled in all aspects, HOWEVER, it is quite confusing and philosophical. There are a lot of intertwining themes and timelines so if you're not one to understand metaphors or philosophy, you any find this movie chaotic or terrible but I for one think this movie is outstanding. It can be extremely confusing but once you understand it (more towards the end) , you will really come to see how amazing and deep this movie really is.",9,DemiCS

                Kimi no Na Wa wasn’t bad, but the plot felt shallow and unrealistic. The concept of musubi which related to threads and sake were justification for multiple time inconsistencies. Even so, I was left unsatisfied and confused.
During the movie, the time allotted for the two protagonists to interact with the other before the cutoff felt very short. The body-switching phenomenon ended before I knew it. As a result, the passing of time between Mitsuha and Taki was not fully captivated; moreover, having the two realize their affections for each other felt somewhat superficial. This was wasted potential for a relationship that could have been built
                  with more depth.
Movies can only cover so much material, but that is no good excuse. The two were literally in each other's bodies, so they must have some sort of mutual understanding. Even so, the movie's approach was not effective. The author strayed from an average concept and had the characters interact through the swapping of bodies; this didn't appeal to me. Having a simple concept and the two experience a meeting in person from the beginning would have worked wonders.
Overall, this was a sentimental story with its unique plot twist. The art and animations were great. In contrast, the characters were mediocre. This was somewhat memorable. I give this a 7/10.",7,_Term

                this movie deserves all the praise it got.

The plot is amazing, good narrative with beautiful animations. OST is exceptionally good. Everything is executed flawlessly, character development is sufficient. 
But I don't feel as sad as the movie intended to be, I have definitely seen sadder anime, but that doesn't mean it's bad. The philosophy behind this anime is something I really like, the two MCs also has a very interesting story and mindset. 
The mix of fantasy & modern day is what I call...magical. Makoto Shinkai is a talented man, can't wait for more

32281,"
                To start with, because I didn't give 10 stars.
I liked practically everything in the film, the romantic development, the way the director develops the supernatural of the film, but the ending. . .
The least I expected from the end of an anime romance film would be a kiss and not the two protagonists looking at each other and crying, all I wanted was a kiss at the end, so the romantic development would be perfect and the film would be 10 stars, making it so my favorite on the romance list,

Think about it, what would you do if you would be in a dream where you can control your body. Would you go to school? Go to work? Hell no, you know you would do something you can't do normally. I liked their friends a lot more, only would I have wanted more story on them for my score to go higher. Story isn't really good, the character development doesn't
                  feel good, it's far too fast as they love one and other without having met once. This would never be a reason for anyone to always be looking for someone else.

                Movie Review: Your Name
	The director of this anime movie Makoto Shinkai was a producer that creates a well known movies that heavily contributed to the anime industry. And as expected, he didn’t disappoint many of his fans in creating the movie Your Name or Kimi No Nawa.
	This story has a setting of two different timelines where Taku who lives in capatial has a three years ahead of time in the timeline of Mitsuha who lives in the province. The story revolves around the two high school students and a meteor that will strike Mitsuha’s place. In one morning, the two students find themselves switch bodies
                  with one another not knowing the reason why. So they kept in touch to monitor each bodies but one morning, all of the traces of Mitsuha was gone so Taku decided to visit Mitsuha’s province. Taku started to realize that his timeline was  three years ahead of Mitsuha’s and learned that Mitsuha was dead already because of the meteor strike that damage her hometown. But Taku didn’t give up so for some reason, they switch bodies. Taku in Mitsuha’s bodies before the meteor stike, try his best to save all people in Mitsuha’s place and he succeeded. Unfortunately, both of them are destined to forget one another but, at the very end of the story they finally met.
	In reviewing the plot, the story was pretty common and some scenes were predictable.  On the other hand, it is not bad because as the plot was simple, the explanation was detailed and the feel of it was not rushed although it will be better if the movie was longer.
	In terms of technicalities, the animation and visual effects are top notch combined with great background music. The storytelling was easy to understand and the sequence of events was not confusing. The overall animation can be considered as masterpiece.
	Overall, although the plot is simple, the execution of the story and how they delivered it makes “Your Name “ the third highest rated movie in MyAnimeList(the most used anime ranking platform).
	For a movie lover who don’t usually watch anime, it is recommended although some will think that it is for kids. The plot was simple and if you are a beginner in watching anime, you’ll find this movie interesting as this have a great animation that will make you in awe.",9,Angelika_Acosta

                A boy and a girl switch bodies. And that's the start of the most complex love story I've ever watched.
It's so very well written, how there are little hints sprinkled throughout of what's really going on, then BAM! You're hit with the realization, and you wonder where the story will go from there. It's really clever and neat execution, but what's impressive is that this movie does that three times.
According to my friend, it's better upon rewatching (which he did when he showed me), but I still enjoyed it. It's just that it felt too complicated right now, so I think I'll have to watch
                  it again in about a year. But this movie did something to me that I can't really explain, that only a few movies have done in the same way; it's gotten me to reflect on my current state in life, what I want to change, and it's making me want to write again and keep honing my skills I want to use later in life. It's something I've been putting off, and (somehow) thanks to Your Name., it's kinda sparked that up again.",8,ToastMyGhost

Spoilers for Your name, I guess
It finally happened. I liked a Makoto Shinkai movie! I never thought this day would come since I find most of, if not all his films either unbelievably doll or shallow. His films are often pretty, I will give you that. However, He tries so hard to be ""emotional"" or try to evoke emotions. It never really worked on me. SO, with that being said, why is this movie so good? What does he do better this time? The answer may surprise you. 
Your name does something better than
                  any other anime or maybe even any other film. What is it? Well, you have to find out later. I am not going to just tell you right away now am I? 
The movie is about a young girl who lives out in the countryside. Her name is Mitsuha Miyamizu. She wishes one day to be a handsome boy from the city. One day she wakes up and wouldn't you know. She has indeed swapped bodies with a handsome, bland boy named Taki Tachibana. So the story is basically a freaky Friday thing (or Kokoro Connect). They live each other's lives and become closer throughout the movie. Here is my first problem with Your Name. I think the romance comes a bit out of nowhere and was not properly developed. (half the film Taki is going after someone else) This is a shame since the emotional scenes that hit later in the film are really well made and pack an emotional punch. The two scenes that hit me were. Towards the end, where Mitsuha falls and looks at her hand (you all know this scene). The second is the actual ending when they see each other in their separate trains. The ending also ties beautifully together with the beginning. Where they both wake up crying and do not know why. In that regard, the beginning of the film is enhanced on a repeat viewing. 
The characters are unfortunately not that interesting, both in terms of design and personality. This is a bit of a problem since romance anime is about liking the main characters and rooting for them to be together. The characters themselves are not really what makes the film good. What is good, are the scenes surrounding the characters. There is the vibrant and energetic montage of them living each other's lives. Taki´s fever dream in the cave. When Mitsuha finally stands up to her father, and so on. There are plenty of very well-made and memorable scenes. Compared to his other works, the scenes and story are actually engaging for once. 
The visuals have always been Shinkai's ""strengths''. I think he goes a bit overboard in most of his films. Where the animation and the background are so overdone. This leads to a form of visual chaos and unclarity. I find my eyes being strained while watching. Your name avoids this problem entirely. The backgrounds are pretty while not being distractive. The meteor shower is beautiful, but the film does not linger too long on them. Giving the viewer time to breathe and to take everything in. From the tranquil countryside to the urban cityscape. 
The plot is not that great either, sorry but it's true. If you think about the plot for more than half a second it all starts to fall apart. The story is full of plot holes and inconsistencies. The most prevalent plot hole is, of course, the fact that neither of them realizes that when they switch bodies, they are also going forward and backward in time. This plot hole takes an amount of suspension of disbelief that can be a dealbreaker for most. That is not to say the story itself is bad. The story has a lot of small pieces that Shinkai leaves for you to pick up on. An example would be that the grandmother indicates that this whole Freaky Friday thing has happened to her in her youth. She does not say it explicitly though, and that is kind of wonderful. 
Okay, it's time for me to reveal what your name does so well. Are you ready? Drum roll, please. 
Insert songs! The music in general is okay, but the insert songs single handedly elevates the film to a new level. All the scenes I have talked about in this review are all made better by the songs. The songs yumetourou, zen zen zense, sparkle, and nandemonaiya all adds so much to the film. When the music builds and explodes in an emotional climax (see the ending scene on the trains, or when she looks at her hand) I simply can not avoid tears. And for a moment, my otherwise cold heart is filled with warmth. The way the song kicks in at the perfect time. The song hits when the emotional beat of the scenes is at its highest. 
If you have read this review, you might have found my opinion to be all over the place. For everything good about the film there are two things I don't like. That's true. The plot and the characters are not that great. BUT! I feel like we have lost something. We have put character development and a tight plot on a pedestal. Making it the most important thing in a story. We have lost something in our search for finding a matrix in which we can evaluate art. We have this one size fits all approach. If you ever find yourself saying ""a good story most have X."" Then you are already missing the point. Art is different and unique; it will hit people differently. 
It's true. The characters are bland as a piece of white paper. There are giant plot holes that make for a mess of a film. So why do you like it so much? you might ask. Well, it's quite simple. I find myself thinking of your name a lot. I think about it more than most anime films, to be honest. Every time I hear a song from the film I get a little emotional. I find myself returning to it more and more. Over time it has stayed with me, it lingers. Art is an experience, you can talk all you want about bad writing and bland characters. If you get something out of it every time. If you keep thinking about it. Then you know you have found something truly special. 
The truth is. You don't really choose the art you like, it chooses you.",7,TheDanishKing

                This anime is an anime of the manga, also named Kimi no Na wa. I read the manga before this film was produced, but did not get anywhere near the feeling of sudden emotion, surprise and heartwarmth.
Kimi no Na wa is an extremely popular film about a male, Taki, and a female, Mitsuha. Taki is a teenage student living in Tokyo, and Mitsuha is of the same, but living in a nature-filled village named Nagasaki.
They share a magical connection where they switch bodies when they sleep, but then wake up shortly after with no recollection of what happened in their own lives. The pair learn
                  to accept this for some time, but when they decide to meet in person, things get complicated.
I won't spoil the whole story for you, but just know that this is a true masterpiece. I couldn't describe this any way other than amazing.
