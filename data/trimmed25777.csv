"
                Attack on Titan's first season never really sat right with me. A series more interested in cinematics (orchestrals, screaming aplenty) than it did in conveying a message or allowing its audience to care for the characters beyond whatever grisly death they inevitably succumb to. It was loud, its presence ever more so, and so I distanced myself from what seemed standard action movie cuisine.
After over three years of silence, its second season comes as something a bit more surprising. It trims away its grimy, cacophonous exterior and presents something, somewhat, more refined. The killing has found a purpose. The world the characters inhabit possesses some
                  semblance of depth. There exists a story with a direction, which is exactly why it will disappoint fans who were expecting it to perpetually wander amidst blood and steel.
To be sure, Eren and crew killing (and conversely being killed) is a formula that proved moderately entertaining in the first season, if only mindlessly so. But a second season? A third? Would it still be exciting, or would people begin to tire of it? I was in the latter camp, and so I find myself glad the goalposts were changed altogether. 
That's not to imply that all of AoT's flaws have been erased. The characterisation remains a sore spot for the series, with Eren continuing to scream nonsense at the top of his lungs, incapable of anything but being a hot-blooded child who is somehow the centrepiece of everything in the world. There's nothing to his character except his being angry all the time, which is why I make no intentions of defending his presence. 
So who is there to defend instead? Mikasa and Armin, the two other primary characters, while less frustrating and less offensive to listen to, don't possess much that wasn't already immediately apparent. They are flat, as are the side characters, so numerous and disposable that I found myself Googling the name of one of the story's new villains because I couldn't for the life of me remember who they even were. Other characters-- Sasha-- are so devoid of character that the only thing they are defined by is the quantity of food they eat. And while the second season gives you marginally more reason to empathise with them throughout their numerous backstory scenes, it still remains difficult to care much about the fates of any of them - a significant issue in a story centred upon war.  It is why I never thought much other than ""ew, gross"" and ""wow, that sucks"" when any of the characters (of which there were dozens) were chewed, dismembered, and/or squished by abhorrent-looking humanoids. 
This is why I think the best way to appreciate Attack on Titan is to focus less on the pieces, and more on the board itself. Attack on Titan's setting is genuinely fascinating, and uncovering its secrets is likely to be the greatest delight for viewers unsatisfied with mere violence. While walled-off communities on the verge of extinction isn't entirely new to anime (Space Battleship Yamato went there in 1974, and Macross in 1982), the massive scale of the cities behind the walls creates ample room for an animated (yet ever so bleak) world to exist. Discovering how the world's agriculture functions, its geography, the state of politics within the Castle, the cultists' activities, and the design of the soldiers' Vertical Manoeuvring Equipment is some of the most fun I've had with an anime in this year or last. More Attack on Titan isn't exactly a proposition that gives me thrills and tingles, but books and other media focusing on its world is something I would absolutely be interested in. A rich setting it is, and with the scale of the world now extending far beyond the walls, there is almost limitless potential. Potential, I suppose, which will probably never extend into its largely mediocre story. 
A mediocre story is still a step up from last season, perhaps. The violence is now more of an accessory to the plot, rather than the inverse, which allows things to follow down a more linear road instead of one winding and circling around ad infinitum. Eren and his allies, as well as his enemies, now have a mission that extends beyond survival. There are antagonists excluding the Titans mindlessly chewing every fleshy thing in sight, which creates a more interesting dynamic, certainly, as the villains are treated as human beings rather than mindless lunatics bent on world destruction, as is seemingly the case in nearly every anime that has ever existed. Some fans may be disappointed that they aren't given a villain to detest, but I've always been of the opinion that a conflict in which no true 'good' and 'bad' side exists is a more compelling tale to tell.
The second season's highlight is no doubt its halfway point, a twist so suddenly and casually revealed that it is natural to doubt one's ears, provided you hadn't already guessed one of their blatantly obvious identities well-beforehand. The ensuing fight scene is neat, as it carries a level of emotional weight so lacking in anything that existed previous. But the extent to which some people have been praising the scene, as though it is the craziest and most ""epic"" thing that has ever appeared in anime, is certainly without much merit.
(It also deserves to be mentioned how downright silly some scenes can be, such as when Armin and Mikasa 'emotionally' eat their rations upon the wall. Moments like this make it considerably harder to take everything else seriously.)
The production quality of Attack on Titan's second season is a minor downgrade from the first's, a fairly disappointing detail when considering the three-year wait and shorter-than-expected episode count. The aforementioned reveal doesn't hit as hard as it should when one of the villains, who is supposed to be menacing, is suddenly given the cheap CGI treatment. The fight scene fares better, with its eyes moving and monstrous fist pausing in slow-motion, but by that point the damage the first impression has created is irreversible. Mediocre animation for AoT may very well be stellar in contrast to the average seasonal anime, but standards are different here, and the ballpark much larger. 
If loud orchestrals are your jam, then things have not changed all too much between 2013 and 2017. The music is still loud and climactic, and the opening, while not quite as memorable as the first two, is a solid addition to the series from both a visual and musical standpoint. But if you're a bit like me, and don't exactly enjoy noise constantly pumping into your eardrums, then Attack on Titan can be a great way to receive a headache. And this is coming from someone who listens to The Money Store on occasion.
It would be a lie to claim I didn't enjoy my time with Attack on Titan. But I am uncertain how much of that is a result of my fascination with the setting, and what, if any of my enjoyment pertains to the actual anime. To claim Attack on Titan is something of great critical merit isn't something I could do without being disingenuous. Decent? Certainly, and a noticeable step above the turgid Hollywood fare its first season was, with the introduction of new antagonists and an actual, tangible story. But for those who waited years for more Titan slaying, I do start to wonder: were they ever really giving the rest of the medium a look?",6

                Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past 4 years, then you’ll know that Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan) has been renewed for a second season. And with that, the show returns in full force. Remember the titans that terrorized humanity when they made their appearance from season one? Or when Eren transformed into a Titan himself and played a pivotal role to help humanity? How about the time when Eren and his friends realized that one of their comrades is also their greatest enemy? Shingeki no Kyojin wastes no time in giving the fans what they want and that’s a sequel
                  to talk about for years to come.
Make no mistake. The second season jumps right into the meat of the show like a bullet train. It doesn’t rely on boring narratives to recap dialogues but instead presents them through events. The first few episodes reintroduces the main characters such as Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Reiner, Bertolt, Sasha, Hange, etc. Time hasn’t passed long either since the defeat of the Female Titan. However, we are introduced to new enemies and conflicts. One of the more noticeable fans will notice is perhaps from the trailer – a beast-like Titan covered with fur. Other conflicts in the second season includes the evolving mystery of certain characters. The secrets they hold close gets more and more complicated as the story progresses and we learn their motivations. Furthermore, the second season builds more into the character relationships outside of the main cast. To say the least, Season 2 isn’t just about the war against Titans but how certain characters’ roles can impact the entire world.
Snk Season 2 attempts to do a lot of things. At times, it feels like a fantasy war-drama while other times, it feels like a mystery story. When you mix a lot of genres together, the show can be interpreted from many angles. Mystery will no doubt be one of the key factors that keeps the story engaging for the viewers. From this season, we’ll discover revelations about certain characters and what influences them to become what they are. These are often told through flashbacks and is done effectively through insightful storytelling. It shows rather than tell about events. Furthermore, it makes us understand the characters better. Now for some fans, this could be a sign that the show will fall victim to “slow pacing”. It’s slightly true as I do wish some episodes to pick up the pace more. It can hold the show back for fans especially if it’s a character that they don’t care about. However, it’s also important since SnK doesn’t toss away characters in favor of just the main cast. Major supporting characters such as Sasha, Ymir, and Krista gets more characterization that was not seen from the previous season. In addition, the series still spends time to get viewers to understand more about the trio of our main cast – Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. Unfortunately with just 12 episodes, don’t expect the second season to give all the characters their chance to shine. If you’re a fan of Levi, then I’m afraid I got some bad news.
Despite the engaging story, season 2’s mystery elements aren’t exactly difficult to decipher. It’s actually quite easy to piece certain pieces together. Every episode builds more and more into the story but some hints will be much more obvious than others. It leaves open to some predictable outcomes. However, I would also argue that season 2 succeeds at building up the suspense regardless how the outcome comes out to be. It injects psychology into the show through effective usage of narrative, dialogues, body language, and character interactions. In some of the later episodes, we can see how certain characters show their true selves in ways that will be very memorable. It’s made even more effective through the timing of certain scenes. Directing a show like Shingeki no Kyojin requires a creative mind to connect the script and I have to say, it did that pretty damn well. Finally, I am satisfied by the faithfulness of the adaptation as it adapts many manga chapters that I had anticipated. In fact, some episodes are actually adapted even better than the manga thanks to the cleverly timings of key events. 
To sum up the production quality of the show, it’s pretty easy to say that Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2 is a firm example of how dark fantasy should look like. I actually had some complaints regarding the first season’s quality but those are pretty much are nonexistent in this sequel. Every episode looks fluid ranging from the intense action, character expressions, and choreography. To an extent, even the CG is done well and that’s no easy accomplishment for many shows. Character expressions highlight characters personality as it gets the fans more excited about them. Season 2 pulls that off flawlessly with characters such as Eren, Mikasa, Reiner, and Ymir. I can also safely say that the Titans in this season look just as intimidating as fans can remember, if not more. 
Known for its high level production quality, season 2’s soundtrack doesn’t come far off either. Theme songs sounds familiar compared to the previous season but has more symbolism and scenes poured into showcase its story. Like most fans of the show, expectations for the OST should be high as Hiroyuki Sawano returns with his craft. It lives up to those expectations especially in some of the key moments that will leave you in awe. Finally, character voice mannerism just works wonderfully as the cast fits right into the shoes of their roles especially for characters like Reiner and Ymir. As I mentioned before, there’s a good amount of psychology that season 2 brings and some characters’ voices really brings to a level that’s larger than life.
Once again, Shingeki no Kyojin gives what the fan want ever since the first season ended in 2013. It’s been 4 years but upon watching the first few episodes, it felt like yesterday. It does its job at selling its story with its variety of genres mixed in together. With such a colorful cast of characters, it gets the fans excited to see what their roles will be. With a studio like Production IG, it’s safe to say that the quality remains in good hands. Now, I am slightly bothered by the length of the sequel. It’s half of what season 1 turned out to be and after all the waiting, it felt like a slap in the face for fans. Still, I’d say that the wait is worth it as time didn’t do its damage and it deserves a pat on the back.",8

                There are anime that truly leave a monumental impact. Not just on the industry, but for each individual viewer. Shows that are so addicting that you just can’t seem to stop watching them. Shows that combine many pivotal elements of storytelling together to create something that is genuinely incredibly well produced. Anime that make you wholeheartedly pleased to have become a part of the anime community.
For me, Attack on Titan is one of these anime. Which essentially means that the four year gap between seasons felt like an EXCRUCIATINGLY long time…
However in all seriousness, I perfectly understand why it took so long to produce the
                  second season of Attack on Titan (AOT). A few anime sequels that I’ve seen have felt rushed and poorly put together. The plot lines becomes less cohesive, characters become more dull, and the animation quality either remains the same or dips in quality. These sequels are usually made within a year or two of the original’s initial airing date. Now while I’m sure that AOT fans would have much preferred an earlier release date for their beloved show, I respect the creators for realizing that they would have received far more backlash for releasing a swiftly produced anime that didn’t live up to the hype of its predecessor as opposed to putting a lot of time and effort into a sequel that matches the caliber of the original. 
In fact, we should all be rejoicing that WIT studio spent time making AOT season 2 as great as it could be instead of releasing a half-assed sequel just to make a quick buck. And you KNOW they would have profited off the sequel no matter how abysmal it might have been. Its Attack on Titan after all, you know, the most popular anime in existence?
Since you probably already know the premise of this show, I won’t bother writing a lengthly (and boring) summary of it. AOT season 2 starts out directly after the last episode of season 1 and dives right into the story. While the first season focused on world building and brought about many mysteries, the second season begins unraveling some of them while revealing even bigger twists then the first season. Even though it was only 12 episodes, half the amount of season 1, I felt like the pacing was, for the most part, rather good. Action scenes weren’t too short or too long, and there were enough of them to keep me entertained while leaving enough time to properly develop the story. Flashbacks were used to further develop the characters, though I question the amount used in the anime, since it is only 12 episodes long.
I just love the setting of AOT. There really is nothing quite like it. Well, I guess that knock-off show involving trains has a similar setting, but that doesn’t count. The interesting and well thought out setting along with the anime’s precise execution really gets the viewers invested in the story, and I constantly kept wondering things like “What exactly are the titans?” and “What’s in Eren’s basement?” Ok, that last one sounds really lame on paper, but its a legitimate question that I’m sure many viewers are curious about. Luckily the anime answers some of these mysteries (which I can’t talk about because of SPOILERS!), but in explaining things, even more questions are posed that make me want to go to my local bookstore and buy the entire Attack on Titan manga just to find out what the heck is going on. 
The most mediocre aspect of the first season for me was the characters. None of them really stuck out to me except for Mikasa, who is pretty awesome, but somewhat lacking in the personality department. Eren always felt a bit one dimensional to me and Armin only got a modicum of screen time, so I never really felt a connection with either of them. In the second season, we see even less of the main trio, but I actually agreed with this approach since it allowed for something that the first season desperately needed; developed side characters.
Season two dedicates a lot of time in developing the side characters, particularly Reiner, Bertolt, Krista and Ymir. This really helped to flesh out these characters which caused me to start to feel a bit of a connection with them. I respect an anime that takes the time to fully evolve its side characters instead of having a bunch of generic wastes of space that no one cares about whatsoever. This development also provides many new perspectives on the AOT world instead of having us simply see Eren’s somewhat narrow minded “I GOTTA GET STRONG AND KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THOSE DAMN TITANS!” perspective, which was quite refreshing.
Linked Horizon returns to preform the opening theme song for Attack on Titan. I initially wasn’t all that impressed with the piece (it needed a bit more YEAGAR!), however as I continued to listen to it, the song really started to grow on me. Behind the anime’s masterful soundtrack is Hiroyuki Sawano. He has consecutively produced many brilliant compositions for other anime, including the first season of AOT, and the quality of his music is no different here. AOT’s soundtrack boasts many powerful orchestral pieces that help to amplify the atmosphere for many situations presented in the anime. The music is so good that I found myself on multiple occasions being captivated by the power and beauty of a few of the compositions present in the show.
The sheer emphasis on detail for some of the animated scenes in the anime (primarily when nothing was moving so that it looked like something taken straight out of a manga) is breathtakingly good. The overall visual presentation of the show is, to me, far superior to that of the other spring 2017 seasonal anime. However the animation is not without flaws. Probably the biggest problem that I’ve heard from the anime community regarding the visuals is a general dissatisfaction with the CGI colossal titan. I unfortunately have to concur, since I felt the the CGI was sort of choppy and didn’t fit in with the rest of the animation. My friend was even more disappointed, and he said that the CGI took away from the big armored and colossal titan reveal. Luckily the use of the CGI is very limited in the anime, and it started to look better to me anyway as the show progressed. 
Where AOT really shines is its entertainment value. This anime is the most exciting thing that I’ve seen in awhile. Part of this is due to the cliffhangers that appear at the end of literally every episode that left me constantly craving more. Whether it was developing the story, presenting a crazy plot twist, or showcasing an epic battle between titans, AOT never failed to keep my attention, a feat that very few things have ever been able to accomplish for me, so for that I give AOT major props. 
I love Attack on Titan. Even with all of its flaws, it still manages to be an incredible viewing experience. Even if the anime doesn’t quite suit your tastes, I almost guarantee that anyone who watches it will be thrilled by AOT’s exhilarating presentation. Its not one of the most popular anime of all time for no reason you know. If you decide to watch this anime or have already done so, I hope that you are as captivated by it as I am.",9
"
                Anticipation.
Blistered, sunburnt skin adorns them, the lumbering thud of footsteps echoes louder with each passing second, their eyes set on a village lying dormant up ahead. Exposed flesh shifting between the woods, no expressed interest for the plant life or animals grazing at their feet. Warped facial expressions, a thousand-yard stare, distorted features, twisted limbs; an ungodly creature, a true force of nature. Deformed giants with one thing in mind.
Beady eyes stare back at the impending danger, irises frantically shifting from each other to the threat slowly approaching with each step, the military cradled behind stone walls planning their first strike. In the dead of
                  silence, every sound amplified. Every second longer than the last. A cacophonous mixture of bated breath, the clanking of metal harnesses strapped to their bodies, housing blades and gas canisters that will eventually propel them towards the enemy. Cold sweat rolls down their cheek, hanging off the chin with nervous anticipation. Faces to the left and right, the unspoken acknowledgment made by brothers-in-arms that this will probably be their final resting place. Too late to back down, too late to think about it. The giants draw near, young scouts fall into dead silence, the slightest whimper exposing their position, sweaty palms firmly gripping their weaponry's handles, blades erected waiting for the signal to go. The longest minute of their lives. 
Action.
The signal is given, piston-propelled grappling-hooks pierces its way through a firm surface, a loud unified roar ushering them into battle — ""Attack!"" — Humanity's final defense catapulting through the sky, wings of freedom crest embroid on their backs, as they stare down the mass collection of imposing figures. The battle begins, blades being embedded into the necks of targets as they fall to their knees. Men carelessly swinging into the jaws of another, blindsided in the fray as the Titan crunches down, blood confetti sprays out, showering the field with the unholy reality of the situation at hand. Human debris piles up next to the simmering sounds of corroding titan flesh. Steam billowing out bloated corpses as it blankets the field, men and Titan alike stuck in the disarray of a free-for-all. Fear and adrenaline push men forward where their bodies refuse to budge, while others cower in defeat, accepting the grim outcome of their faith. An insatiable desire to consume keep Titans swarming where an absence of ""self"" resides. The fight rages on.
There's no chess game at play here. No battle of wits. No war cry to rally any remaining fighting spirit. All that's left in the midst of chaos is an animalistic drive to kill or be killed. Men swinging their blades frantically, bodies jettisoned by wire towards the unknown hidden behind plumes of smoke. Uncaring giants solely driven by a gluttonous appetite, grabbing at any signs of human life, unfazed by the burning ash of their reduced numbers laid to waste by the prey they feast on. All concerns are eclipsed, all formalities discarded, idealism abandoned, time holds still, the nightmare stretches on endlessly... until there's no one left to keep it alive.
Aftermath. 
Scattered limbs litter the ground with no owners to claim them. The earth soaks up the battered dregs of human remains, leaving only remnants to be discovered by those unfortunate enough to stumble upon it. Regurgitated balls of bodily fluids perched on top fallen victims, disfigured men trapped inside, destined to stay nameless. Steam gently ascends to the sky, departing from the mass graveyard positioned below. Men on horseback approach the sorrowful sight, disgusted but desensitized to what's become far too common of an occurrence in their day to day lives. A ghoulish figure hunched over, tearing into the flesh of a nameless scout, unconcerned with the men gathering around it. Quickly being dispatched by them, they see no triumph in their action, only another hopeless notch under humanity's belt. Their time for peace has long departed, leaving it its place a constant dread of the unknown. From the sporadic home invasions of Titans to even the secrets concerning the walls themselves. Things that were once thought of as reassurances now only add to the anxiety pending up with each violent encounter. 
When your home turf is compromised, where else can you turn? When your overseers keep potentially harmful secrets from you, who can you trust? The mystery compounded, the fights more brutal, and the stakes set higher than ever. This is the kind of world Attack on Titan gives birth to. A place dictated by stonefaced laws of Darwinism in every regard. A place that's adored the world over by the audiences that flock to it. 
Reception. 
Attack on Titan left big shoes to fill since its 2013 debut. Almost overnight, it became one of the most popular anime titles of all time, effectively surpassing the glass ceiling set over the medium at large to become a noticeable player in the stratosphere of everyday pop culture. Even if that success was to a lesser degree when compared to the likes of ""the big 3"" and the Dragon Ball franchise that made its way out as well, its impact was still noticeable, both domestically and overseas. This, alongside works like Sword Art Online, has positioned it as one of the poster-child images of what ""anime"" is to non-anime fans of the 2010s. Occupying shelf space in your local Hot Topic, being mentioned in passing by those oblivious to the entire culture at large, a conversation starter to introduce others to an active community that bubbles on the surface but never making enough big waves to become acknowledged on a mainstream level. The show's relevance in recent years cannot be understated.
It's a new footnote that continues the narrative, helping push the medium and partakers of it a step closer to accessibility in other avenues of a broader mainstream culture. Because of its exposure, for many, Attack on Titan became their initial gateway title into the anime medium. And as such, a milestone entry when searching for that same thrill that it offered up on its initial encounter. For better or for worse, AoT shaped the landscape of future anime entries, many of which seeking to retain the newfound fanbases that sprouted because of it. And while there was a sleuth of cheap knock-offs offered up to keep the flame burning since then, nothing was capable of whetting the appetite in the same way it did.
4-years and many cheap imitations later, AoT has reemerged once again! But the question is, is it 4-years too late? 4-years may not seem like a long time in the grand scheme of things, but for media, it's practically a millennium. A lot could happen in 4-years. New emerging trends develop, talented figures could make their debut appearance, a shift in the landscape in favor of real-world sociopolitical events could occur, and most importantly, the demands of people can evolve as they foster different tastes and interests. 
You don't have to look far to see these occurrences happening. In the movie industry, more specifically, tentpole blockbusters, superhero films have effectively become the new age westerns, to the point where watching them becomes a ritualistic event shared by a mass majority, making those that don't participate outsiders to watercooler conversations. In music, the new ""wave"" in the past few years has been trap-inspired production and dancehall-influenced rhythms, a transition that's proven to be so successful that even megastars that dominate the pop charts are flocking to get in on the action. Even in our own backyard, in the world of anime, creating ""subversions"" or reimaginings of established formulas, from the likes of MMO-inspired premises to superhero stories, is the popular thing to do at the moment, with many recent hits owing their success, to some degree or another, to that directional push. 
Media is a beast that's constantly shifting in order to appease the masses, unless the pedigree of the product in question is of a high caliber, expecting it to stay still until your return is foolhardy, and from a marketing standpoint, a huge risk to take. 
So, did Attack on Titan's gamble pay off? Well, it all depends on where you stand as a viewer.
Fortunately for Attack on Titan, the efforts of its bottom-rung imitators served a purpose. Like the MMO and superhero shows that dominate the current landscape in anime, post-apocalyptic stories are still in high demand as well. The manner in which it is received, however, is a completely separate issue. You see, within that 4-year period, those rose-colored lenses that many fans may have had during its initial run may no longer be there, or at the very least, those ""lenses"" have since been washed out to something closer to transparency, as it usually does when someone grows older and become accustomed to certain things. Where they could have been hoodwinked with a few plot twists and shocking moments before, the chances of that level of susceptibility dwindles as time passes. With every encounter made with something employing the same general gimmick, the magic is now met with a response succumbed to apathy. Each time something that appears novel makes itself known, the next encounter of the same content slowly morphs into a future cliche in the making. It's the gift and the curse that comes with transitioning oneself towards a more seasoned mindset. There still may be an eager audience waiting to see the story unfold but that's usually accompanied with a higher level of skepticism, making the work of any follow-up season that much harder to live up to the initial ""hype"" that came with its debut. It's for that reason that the infamy of the ""sophomore slump"" exists, and to no one's surprise, Attack on Titan's 2nd season is met with a divisive mixture of applauds and woes.
So, reader, do you gawk at the attempts made by the 2nd season to employ the same bag of tricks, or do you approach in a way that many veteran viewers do when watching something as flamboyant as Attack on Titan? If you're reading this review, I'm going to make the assumption that you're not comprised of the mass majority that doesn't care either way. As far as your viewpoint goes when discussing AoT after finishing this review, I leave that bit of trivializing up for you to decide. Everything moving forward is just me pleading my case and my stance on the matter, so take from it what you will. 
The reception I have for AoT's 2nd season is pretty straightforward, I love every minute of it! It's just as nutty, over-the-top and gratuitously violent as I remembered. It's a show that brings me back to a simpler time in my life, where excessive violence and theatrics were the only things that stimulated my viewing habits. A time in my life where movies like The Matrix and Equilibrium were as coveted as holy scripture and any verbal disapproval of it was treated like sacrilegious acts. 
Attack on Titan 2nd season is just awesome! Schlocky, cumbersome, inconsistent, poorly-written, overacted, exploitative, childish, melodramatic, hammy, riddled with plotting and tonal issues... BUT still fucking awesome! And while I do love it wholeheartedly, those issues I mentioned don't just magically go away, and seeing that this is a review and not a drunken get-together with friends where we scream ""FUCK YEAH!!!"" at the top of our lungs, as we view the poor inhabitants of AoT being chomped in half by giant nake people, I will judge it accordingly.
Fidelity.
What a pleasant surprise. I think I express the sentiments of many when I say that I approach most sequels with a great deal of apprehension. More often than not, sequels tend to disappoint and for understandable reasons when examined. If it follows the 1st installment verbatim, it's simply seen as a rehash, if it veers off course too much then it runs the risk of not capturing the essence that made the 1st great. It's that old adage expressed by many “You’ve got your whole life to write your first record, and only a few years to write the second.” So when I sat down to be immediately met with the familiarity of AoT's flare for the dramatic still intact, I was more than pleased. Even after the first season, where I felt that the show may have exhausted every possible gruesome fatality or creative action scene in its arsenal, this follow-up season somehow managed to ratchet up the stakes and tension, while keeping the locations and bloodbath battles fresh and exciting. 
The spirit of AoT was carried over seamlessly and with its usual offering of plot twists and shock factor moments being placed center-stage, there was never an episode that passed where I wasn't enjoying myself. 
This consistency stood true for the art and animation as well. With new locations and settings being introduced, the expansion that was already given from season one is further complimented here. Employing the same European-like building structures and familiar environments, marathoning both seasons would yield very little in the way of distracting changes. It's fresh but familiar. Changing things up when necessary but never to the point of alienation. Although, there was an issue present that might turn some people off. The usage of CGI is far more prevalent this time around, and admittedly, lazily implemented at times as well. For example, there are scenes of men on horseback at some point, during which, when the camera pulled back for an aerial shot, you could see them galloping above the surface of the ground, giving this look of a 3D rendered image being dragged across a landscape in post-production. This hovering effect is amateurish for a studio that's usually praised for doing above average in the visual department. Where it set the standard in season one, in season two, it's barely maintaining it. The CGI used for the giant titan was also distracting. Not for the actual look of the Titan itself but for the framerate, which wasn't succinct with the animated shots of characters around it. 
Other than the issues found with the CGI, the rest of the production was very appealing. I am slightly disappointed though, knowing that with 4-years given to create a stellar product, Wit Studio ended up shortchanging themselves. And it's not like they had to touch up on their skills in this department, they've already proven that they're capable of meshing CGI with 2D animation just fine with their bootleg Titan show, Kabaneri, of last year. So to give their main cash-cow second-class treatment seemed like a huge disservice. Whatever the reason behind the copout service may be, here's hoping it doesn't continue with future installments. 
Thankfully, everything else was up to snuff, making those blemishes far more palatable than it would have been otherwise.

The story continues off with the discovery of new mysterious events that slowly makes itself known to the viewer. Everything has been called into question, as the Titan face exposed from within the wall at the end of season one plunges everyone into deeper secrets surrounding the church and the following occurrences that led up to the aftermath of Annie's capture. Tensions rise, as paranoia slowly seeps into the Scout regiments. No one could be fully trusted. With Annie being a Titan, the possibility of more traitors in the mix becomes a high possibility. The war has shifted on both sides now, with Titans moving in headfirst and the fear of more enemies hidden within the ranks just lurking out of focus. 
And the rest of the story effectively follows a barrage of plot twists one after the other, of which, any type of hints would effectively spoil the surprise, so I'll leave that bit of discovery up for you to witness yourself. AoT does what it's best known for, delivering on nail-biting cliffhanger moments one after another. There's never a shortage of reveals being discovered here. Some that's a bit obvious for those paying attention and others that are completely left-field if the anime is your only exposure to the material at hand. 
Accompanying men into battle, we're given a fantastic musical backing, with thunderous drums, booming brass sections, and blood-curdling violin chords, all being wrapped up and carried off by the unified echo of a haunting studio choir; all of this crashing headfirst with electrifying musical underpinnings, creating a futuristic orchestric sound. And in the heat of battle, this soundtrack does an amazing job at giving everything a vintage feel while positioning it firmly in the 21st century. It's a clash of classical meets new that's unified under the sound of constant dread and ascension. 
This makes it one of AoT's best highlights. Despite the shortcomings of the show's characters and storytelling, this aspect remains a spotless feature, something destined to age incredibly well for years to come. 
And since I just mentioned it, and there's only so long that I could dance around the subject matter before pointing at obvious pressing issues, time to discuss the aspects that constantly keeps AoT from reaching the ambitious heights that its universe desperately attempts to cling to. 
Sloppy. 
First and foremost, Attack on Titan's screenplay is written as if the Caps Lock key was left on the entire time. 
If this review was written in the way the characters were made to emote, EVERYTHING WOULD JUST BE WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS JUST LIKE THIS SENTENCE. And I'm sure I don't need to express just how distracting or ridiculous that could get for those wanting something a bit more serious. Couple that constant barking with some overexaggerated facial expressions, where the characters are given their best ""rape face"" expressions, and you will be none the wiser had you just seen a clip and thought you were looking at an anime parody of shounens. Truth be told, part of the reason why I enjoy AoT has to do with this very feature. That schmaltzy level of overacting has always been something I found amusing, but unfortunately, that's not the show's intent, as it displays no comedic bone in its body for any of these exaggerated scenes. This isn't Jojo's Bizarre Adventure where everything hints towards a tinge of comedic self-awareness—no, in Attack on Titan, everything is played seriously, causing it to come off like a circus performance where everyone is dressed in all leather.
This can make some dramatic moments hard to invest into. And it's for that reason that I ask how you're consuming Attack on Titan. Because if your approach demands no room for levity or laughter, chances are, many scenes here may make you want to gouge your eyes out. Anyone that could view an armless Eren beating the living snot out of someone with his arm stumps, while foaming at the mouth like a rabid animal, rapey-face set to maximum, and STILL take it seriously, despite all this, has my admiration. I keel over in laughter seeing moments like that. It's a show that can't escape the innate hilarity of some of its content. For me, part of the fun of AoT is seeing that constant struggle to capture authenticity and seriousness, despite the content suggesting otherwise. Viewing it in this way may not be the original intent of the staff and creators, but it's entertainment at the end of the day, how I choose to enjoy it is entirely up to me. 
Which brings me to the other issue that the show can't shake: poorly written characters.
Armin is the only character in all of Attack on Titan with a proper character arc. There's no arguing this, no IFs ANDs or BUTs, this is just a fact. Out of everyone presented, he remains the only member of AoT's cast that was given any sort malleable personality, an internal reflection, and eventual growth that STAYED that way. For everyone else, Eren included, there's only a phantom resemblance of a character arc, but in reality, their constant dominating character traits actually cause them to have the adverse effect. Instead of showing character development, they end up going through character regression instead. For the easiest example, let's take a look at Eren. 
In the 1st season, they made it a point to show that he's a hardheaded young man who's willing to throw himself into the heat of battle whenever someone or something agitates him. Constantly short-tempered and outspoken, he's made out to be a very unlikable person to many around him. His hostile behavior usually led to him getting into physical brawls with older authority figures and even his fellow peers. Understandably, at first, he only had a few friends that took to his side, those being Mikasa and Armin respectively. And even then, it could be argued that during that time, those two friends were only earned due to certain circumstances. Because of Eren's pivotal role in Mikasa's past when they first met, she felt a sense of obligation and appreciation for his actions, which eventually led to an appreciation for him as a person as a result. And after being placed under the same roof, it was easy to nurture a relationship, given that they got time to know each other on a day-to-day basis. In Armin's case, Eren represented the bravery he lacked in himself, as he constantly stood up for him when he couldn't bring himself to do anything but cower at any bully that enters his space. He basically saw him as the big brother he never had. In both cases, Eren's pigheaded resilience and loyalty to those he cares for were what won them over. And so, a rebellious character trait was quickly established. One that led to positive outcomes in very limited situations. 
Later on, as the series progressed, he was placed in circumstances where that very personality was used as a catalyst for his growth, more specifically, when he was placed in situations where his pigheaded attitude endangered the lives of people around him. The biggest highlight of this comes with the time he spent under Levi's camp, as well as his transformational moments as a Titan. long story short, his outbursts began to affect more than just his pride, it caused several irreversible incidents where his actions were directly connected to the issue at hand. This eventually culminated, to what looked at the time, like Eren turning a new chapter in his life. He's now more calm, even mindful of the ones around him. He understood that his behavior isn't doing anyone any good. And as his bandaged body sat upright in bed with Mikasa staying by his side comforting him, Eren's journey in the first season came to a reasonable point of conclusion. 
Fast forward to the second season and all of that was immediately flushed down the toilet for an instant character reset. Any semblance of growth shown was immediately replaced back with the same hot-blooded behavior and hammy overacting he was notoriously known for. This form of character regression isn't excused as someone stuck in their old ways, it's the act of behind-the-scene creators understanding Eren's marketability as an angry youth. People are weary of any kind of change and so Eren was forced to remain two-dimensional, regardless of any personal revelations he may have had. 
And before there's confusion on what qualifies as growth, no, receiving a backstory isn't it. A backstory only helps when the character in question grows further from the present day acquaintance with which we first encountered them. 
The rest of the characters can effectively be boxed into neurotic personality traits or future cannon fodder. It's the type of show that relies on the ensemble cast to carry the personality that any given individual may lack. Think of it like colors in a rainbow, everyone involved is basically an individual color, making them basic when alone but exciting when placed together. It's a common trick to use when there are too many characters involved and not enough time dedicated to any of them.
And speaking of the narrative, possibly the biggest complaint launched at Attack on Titan ties into this. 
Honestly speaking, AoT has very little in the way of a well-written story. It's a show that's overly reliant on over-the-top plot twists, mystifying everything as to appear purposeful, and a gratuitous about of shocking deaths and revelations made at the drop of a hat to keep audience attentiveness. And as it is in the case of the overacting, this too is something I enjoy about the show. It's like a constant wack at a visual piñata, with each hit revealing something unknown inside. To me, that's the reason AoT is such an entertaining piece of media, it's its ability to constantly unveil new, and often ridiculous, plot revelations. Each time you return, it has something new to offer, regardless of how familiar it may get to other moments prior. 
But again, that's just the way I choose to consume and enjoy the show. As for the pedigree of writing on display, it's absolutely abysmal. It's a show that's reliant on your acceptance to a myriad of plotting inconsistencies, excessive mental gymnastics in regards to many of its plot twists, and a high suspension of disbelief for the mechanics of its universe. If you're an astute viewer, there would be many times when you're forced to call into question the validity of the events playing out. And if you choose to take the show seriously and hate it as a result, you would completely be entitled to do just that. 
Contention. 
I usually distance myself from the community and their consensus in regards to any show when I'm working on a think-piece about it, but with Attack on Titan, that's proven to be virtually impossible, especially for someone like myself that's made it a habit to publicly airing out my opinions. Several people approached me with their thoughts on the show and after awhile, I began to notice the thread of a narrative taking form, which admittedly, affected the way I approached this review as a result. And for the sake of bringing clarity to what I think has become a misinformed argument that's been generated towards this second season, I will address that general complaint here and now. 
If you felt like the quality of this season has significantly dipped since the debut of the 1st, please rest assured that it haven't, it's you as a viewer who's grown beyond the content at hand. All these complaints launched at the show now are just as applicable to what was given from the very beginning in 2013. Season one had just as much diluted plotting, expository verbal dumps, long periods of substance-less content and character victimizing. It's only now that you're older does those issues become more apparent. 4-years is a long time, and in that time, you're bound to grow up as a viewer, even if you still find yourself indulging in the same kind of content. Your awareness of it has simply matured since then. Quality-wise, both seasons of Attack on Titan are on the same level. The only difference found are minor and not worth elevating the first installment leagues ahead of this follow-up. 
And with that being addressed, it's time I wrap this review up. 
Conclusion.
If you were to ask me what my favorite anime viewing experiences were based solely off of entertainment value and absolutely nothing else, Attack on Titan would easily rank up there with Death Note and Kaiji. As an overblown piece of media, the show is a constant roller coaster ride of violence and plot twists, all beautifully set to a great soundtrack and nice visuals. Content-wise, it has very little to offer, and honestly, without the constant barrage of bloody fatalities and sensationalized violence, I would probably get bored with it. But as it stands, this anime represents ""hype-inducing"" content for me in the truest sense of the term.
It's a hammy, grindhouse-inspired work of artistically shot ultraviolence. Like a big lovable oaf, a show oblivious to just how ridiculous every situation presented is. It's pure spectacle, plain and simple. It's one of my favorite pieces of schlock of all time and a show I will revisit many times to come because of that.",6

                So, fucking 4 episode in when this review was written. Alot of shit has happen eh? I personally think AOT is a very overrated show, that can only deliver the tropes of here's an almost unbeatable group of monsters or beings, so now they fight for survival. That sorta setting isn't really all that complicated, but rather, extremely too straight forward and simple. But however, hohoho, this season so far is something else. Not only did we finally get to delve into some mystery and introduction to more characters, side character's background (the more interesting ones in the series, im bored with Eren/Armin/Mikasa sorta drama
                  tbh), more revelation about the titan itself, a new antagonist (that's not titans in general or titan shifter with no tangible reason as to why they wanted to go against humanity), and the even more complicated kind of setting and plot twist to this anime about the past. In addition to that, the portrayal of human psychology was too real. This is probably the most realistic aspect that the author and the director has tackle for the state of the mind of the character in certain circumstances, like the state of being shock, or crying in tears for mercy or help. There're also some other interesting theme to this as well, with the sentimental (protect your love ones, abide by your religion etc.) vs logic (soldier and humanity should priotize saving, not go against protecting humanity), deep talks on some philosophical thoughts (like priotizing your culture and community, or abandon them to save other culture and other community). All of that, I could only say that this anime, at least season 2 of AOT, is now my new favorite anime of all time. No other anime, tv series, movies and such would ever approach a story like the way the author of AOT had written this story. If you are just like me who couldn't even see the worth in season 1 of AOT, season 2 of AOT is definitely something else, the approach is so different from its previous season and I guarantee, this season is amazing. 
If you've never read the manga then this is one of those few anime, or plot where the audience can actually theorize along their way of watching until the revelation has been reveal. As far as I know, you dont even have to be a hardcore fan of the series to share your conjecture.",9

                Season 2 has come and gone and this three month was really enjoyable, but do not fear, season 3 is already announced for 2018! Now on to the review.
Story 10/10:
Snk season 2 picks up right where season 1 left off, and it give the viewers a bit more insight about the titans in the walls. The thing with snk is that its story is slowly unravelling for both the characters and the viewers, we learn of the ape titan that can speak and that titans obey his orders, we also learn that without a doubt titans are humans, we learn that Ymir who is now
                  known as a titan shifter knows a lot of secrets that she is hiding and that she is over 60 years old. We also got the reveal of the arrmored and the iconic collosal titan which are characters that we saw from the very first season, this really should be the turning point for many persons that this series is not just about humans fighting titans/ 
It's way more than that and as the story progresses the plot gets more complicated, what really shines for this series is how well it foreshadows or give hints to the viewers of future plot event, and imo the series gets more enjoyable when you learn more things in future plot and then rewatch an earlier season and you will see how the author cleverly hinted at certain things, like for eg, the identity of all three of the titan shifters, if you go and rewatch the first season you will realise all those hints were being drop, overall just rewatch the first season and you will see how well put together the story is, the best way to explain snk story is that it is a like a puzzle that is slowly being put together, and sometimes you the viewers if you pay more attention to it can fill in some of the blanks with the info you got so far, because this series doesn't leave viewers in the dark without giving the readers hints. It also makes you question what is going on or the motive behind the titan shifters, why do they want to kill everyone inside the walls? What is their motive? What we did find out at the end of the episode is that Eren can control titans, and that is the reason why the Annie, Reiner and Bertholdt wanted to capture Eren. I always like series that makes you question yourself and makes ponder about certain things.
Art 8/10:
I thought the art was solid overall, there is some bad shots that I've seen throughout the series, but I've notice that when it doesn't look good is when the characters are not close up, also the Cgi was not to my liking it puts me off in some scenes, but overall it didn't affect my enjoyment much since most of the cgi was use on horse scenes, which lasted just for a few seconds, but what really annoyed me was the collosal titan cgi, it looks horrible! Though sometimes it doesn't look bad, but overall I will like them to scrap that and make the collosal titan fully hand drawn like the first season. Overall art and animation was solid imo and not much complaint.
Sound 9/10:
The soundtracks in season 2 is great, and I'm glad that they didn't completely got rid of the old soundtracks, because that would might make us loose the snk feel to it, What Sawano did was smart, he remix some of the old soundtrack and also added new soundtracks in this season, the only disapppointment  is that we didn't get enough new soundtrack imo, now the reason could be is that this season is 12 episode instead of 25, so less soundtrack, but overall I was please with the soundtracks in this season.
Characters 8/10:
Imo, I feel this season really flesh out more of the side characters and give more focus to them, the main cast for this season got little screen time for the entire first half of season 2, but this was actually a good thing, we got a lot of character development and characterization for all these characters in this season, though a  flaw that I saw in this season is that there were too many flashback, which is a method also use to develop a character and also the anime staff added fillers in the flashback to extend it a bit more, this is a flaw when it comes to adapting a source material, they want the season to end at a certain point, and so the anime staff pad out the flashback with stuff the viewers already know of and this is really annoying imo, this is a legit critcism that I agree with.
Enjoyment 10/10: 
For me, what really made me enjoy this season is because, me being a manga reader already know what happens in future events, and thus watching season 2 is like rereading the series but instead with soundtrack and animation etc, and as I said before seeing all the foreshadowing and understanding the vague discussion going on between certain characters just makes me appreciate this series more and that is why I really enjoy it so much. 
This is where the series starts to shift in tone and I can see why some persons may not like this season as much as the first and vice versa, and in the next season it will be taking another shit in the story as well, really interested to see anime only reaction to season 3.
Overall 10/10: 
This series is a masterpiece despite its flaws, a masterpiece doesn't mean it has to be a perfect series, because the truth is, there is no perfect series. This series is very ambitious in where the overall story is going, and I know not everyone will appreciate this series like me, because opinion, but I am very happy a series like this exist, it is what made me become a hardcore anime fan, and I hope when this series is complete persons will appreciate what the author was going for and not what they wanted it to be, 2018 can't come any sooner.
Thanks for reading. ;)",10

                Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the creator of the ends of the Earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.
- Isaiah 40:28-31
The second coming of Christ hath solemnly smiled upon us and
                  I am very passionate about this. The plot thickens, although not really. The series is kicked off with some pretentious monologue by Armin reminding us of what the general outline of the show looked like, probably either because the producers have little to no faith in their audience's mental capacity and just assume everyone has forgotten the plot over the span of 4 years or they just didn't have an episode's worth of material. Titan appears out of nowhere, titan eats human. Good? Good. Annie Leon-who? In case anyone does remember, last's season finale left off with a completely unnecessary cliffhanger that only put even more expectations on this season to deliver. tl;dr IT DOESNNNNNNNNNN'T
Among monkeys, loose plot threads and other things, the big focus of this season seems to be on the titan shapeshifters. A mechanic that was first introduced to the series when everyone's second favorite main character got swallowed whole (deadweight Armin at it again), before being resurrected in full, non-CGI titan glory. Fastforward 20 something episodes later, and it is a technique utilized by literally half of the 104th Trainees Squad members. Despite losing its initial charm, the colossal and armored titan have been presented since the very first episode while the series was at its peak and thus still managing to retain a candle of relevancy.  
Colossal Titan : Begins breach of Shiganshina first episode, catalyst of all destruction, all-around menacing presence
Armored Titan : Unstoppable force, mows down the gate of Wall Maria causing impending doom upon thousands, exhales steam
Ymir/Ymir Titan : Dyke, ???
What a revelation, seriously. I wholeheartedly wonder if the atrocious lack of screen time and presence of her character during the entirety of the series prior to the reveal are to be attributed to the author wanting her to remain a mysterious figure or downright not giving a shit. But wait, they showed us that 12 minute flashback between her and Historia to showcase just how powerful their relationship was, talk about depth. That's another thing, as soon as there's some groundbreaking reveal it is either cut short by a flashback or even cliffhanger (which are proven to be able to last up to a grand total of 4 years). Both reveals this season start off at an alright pace before being brushed off to the side because of Muh explanations. When half of episode 5 after Ymir's big reveal proves to be a boring flashback that realistically correlates to nothing of substance regarding our current situation apart from some meager hints regarding Historia (this is Ymir's big moment, mind you), SOME VIEWERS MIGHT GET DISENGAGED. WHOOP DE FUCKING DO. Now imagine if the finale of first season's episode 5 were cut short by a cliffhanger, and rather than Eren jumping into a titan's mouth to save Armin the episode was proceeded by a whopping half an episode's worth of some ""mandatory"" flashback dating back to that one schooltrip they held in 5th grade. Just for brevity's sake, you know? Because who wants non-meandering content anyway.
I also love how the meeting to discuss whether Ymir's a titan and where her loyalties lie was essentially the exact same as the one in season one regarding Annie. Eren is always shoved into this role of the dumbass optimist who's like ""B-but, muh friends.."" while he sits in disbelief as everyone else clobbers him with facts and it's pretty funny, if nothing else. It's really just used as a tool to make certain characters like Hanji stand out as great strategists and/or intellectually-capable, when in reality it just makes Eren seem like a stupid brat who's constantly in denial even when the obvious is made obvious. But Anni--I mean Ymir's a friend, how could she?! After Ymir helps saves the lives of countless soldiers, she is then briefly treated to a life of imprisonment, just before being swallowed whole by the Colossal titan. But it's Ymir, so you don't care. Connie titan when?
Obviously, the big selling point of these 12 episodes is supposed to be Eren's grandiose throwdown versus Reiner and Bertholdt,  friends who he once looked up to turned enemies, for reasons.. unbeknownst. What carries this plotpoint is the fact that Eren never needed to have a fleshed out relationship with either Reiner or especially Bertholdt for it to work, which he didn't. The mystery behind both the Colossal and Armored titans was present from the first day whilst the Attack on Titan was at its highpoint. I would've walked out a happy man, had, you know, the actual revelation not been so piss poor. The way the reveal was handled holds complete contrast over anything the show's director, Tetsuou Araki is actually good at. The whole subtle and unconventional tone I imagine Isayama was building toward missed its mark entirely and assigning it to a man who's literally built his entire career off of making overblown and adrenaline inducing scenes and series surely isn't a good starting point. So far I have encountered not a single criticism as the people who are proclaiming it to be some nonchalant masterpiece of delivery and storytelling are running rampant. It's mere misjudgment over subtlety, but I digress.
First off, the Armored Titan has an uncanny resemblance to Reiner Braun. While this idea seems to have been entirely scrapped in Berthold's case for some reason, they went to insane lengths to mimic Reiner's look to the itty bitty details in correlation to the Armored titan: the minimal contrast between white and blonde, the exact same cleancut hairstyle, a body physique that can hardly be attributed back to anyone in the show but him, and even the trademark glowy yellow eyes shared only with Pixies. The exact same problem plagued the first season in the shape of Annie; the hair length, color and eyes would already have drastically decreased the amount of possible suspects by tenfold, but the genius of Hajime Isayama even bothered drawing in her god damn crooked fucking nose. He clearly has either no faith in his audience's mental capacity or simply doesn't understand that the point of mystery is supposed to be withholding information until a given point rather than violently shoving it down the viewer's windpipe. Okay, fine. They physically resemble each other, what else? Bertholdt. While Reiner actually attempts giving off a faint sense of dread while some eerie music is playing in the background, Bertholdt just completely ruins it. Despite for once not resembling his titan counterpart, when the man is not looking constipated, he is completely sealing off any potential doubts in anyone's mind about any other possibilities about the situation. ""Could Reiner possibly have lost his mind..?"" Obviously not, because Bertholdt is just fucking screaming in his ear 24/7, ""NO REINER DON'T TELL HIM NOOOO"". Well, I guess that's cleared up. They're gonna transform now, right? Any minute now. This is kinda dragging on.. OH WAIT IS THAT MIKASA HOLY FUCK 10/10 WHAT A REVELATION.
If you thought the ""Humanity is at the brink of extinction"" storyline is the weak link, think again. The cast of Attack on Titan is so evidently plagued by cliches and dumb action series tropes that you could pretty much associate any major character with a single adjective if you really wanted to. Calling my assessment here redundant would almost be a fair criticism considering that a similar point can be made in regards to arguably any popular seasonal anime born and molded by hype culture in recent memory. However, what makes AoT stick out like a sore thumb and possibly make it the biggest offender of this near-archetype turd is the broad scale of characters it decides to play the story out with. Operating on such vast cast of notable proportion can oftentimes lead to success (insert pseudo-elitist LotGH shoutout), but it can also damage a series by making it loose focus on primary objective. In this specific case when deciding to roll with a huge cast, you can choose from either 2 routes:
- Put in a conscious amount of time and effort into character development and have an actual go at fleshing them out (talk about boring)
or
- Treat your entire cast as human cattle, excusing any lack of potential depth with pitiful sob stories. When midnight comes around, murder them for SHOCK FACTOR !!! (hell yeah)
I realize that the line is very blurred in this case so feel free to take your time pondering which one we've been stuck with for a consecutive 37 episodes. As you may or may not already know, the story primarily revolves around an edge-riddled brat that is fueled by teenage angst as without it he loses all self and intrinsic meaning in this world. In the second season, he makes many a guest apearences throughout half of the season that he is in. All Eren Jaeger wishes for in life is to fulfill his petty vendetta by exterminating an entire species, and if that doesn't sound like a ludicrous pipedream of an egocentric teenager, I don't know what does. You would assume that being the protagonist of the story, he would have something worth noting in regards to his character, but he really doesn't. The entire backbone of his character lies the fundamentals of being dumb, bratty and angsty coupled with a motivation that stem from the final five, and it especially shows when he's even overshadowed by lifeless ragdolls such as Mikasa. There is nothing about Eren that makes him an interesting, distinct or compelling main character in the slightest. He is an angst powered locomotive; equipped with a smidgen of brash ""personality"", a petty sob story that's supposed to make you sympathize with him and of course, his desire for  vengeance being placed on a pedestal above all else. 
That in mind, you sure as hell wouldn't be able to spell Eren without spelling Mikasa first, so give it up for arguably the best girl in the series by sheer process of elimination - Mikasa Ackerman. Mikasa is just the perfect recipe for success. She has the looks, the smarts, the skills. Everything. She can't grow or develop because she is already a God put upon this green earth. Most people excuse her lifelessness as compelling because she too has a sad backstory. Mommy and daddy got lynched, there goes my personality and compassion as a human being, boo fucking hoo. Despite being completely devoid of any human emotion what so ever, she still harbors a deeply-rooted love and respect for her not-so-related-by-blood brother, Eren. Although Eren admittedly arrived a bit late to the party, he made up for it by giving her some rugged old scarf. This admiration for Eren arouses a multitude of paradoxes. Can a person void of any underlying emotion really learn to love someone, if even themselves? Is it incest? The fundamental flaw of Mikasa's character is perfection and it works because people tend to drool over this type of shit all the time. Especially in the case of Attack on Titan, where it's not even far-fetched to call the show a  global epidemic where people who don't even watch anime regularly tune in to see cartoons battling it out because, hype. No such person cares seeing a complex or relatable cast over unrealistic, Superman-esque characters like Mikasa kicking ass. The most the writer could've hoped to achieve with Mikasa was to use her as a tool for spreading some noble-like message such as female empowerment. Even then -- tough luck little girly, you're never going to be like Mikasa. Mikasa is God.
What happens when you're a realistic character in the Attack on Titan universe? You either get friendzoned because the girl you're into has an incestuous crush on her half-brother, or you're just a total loser who cannot accomplish anything on their own apart from cuddle up in a blanket like the deadweight that you naturally are. Enter Armin, everyone's favorite punching bag. As stated, Armin suffers from the severe deformity known only as ""Realism"", making him a rather niche and tough character to support in or indulge in. Rather than being portrayed like a constant beacon of light and glamour as say Mikasa, he is instead shown to be a cowardly, weak-willed and frail kid. W-wow, c-c-could it be.. an actual human being? Burn the witch!! While Armin does not represent your wildest power fantasy, he is instead a connoisseur of humanity, a drop of realism and a look at what would have been. Despite proving a much needed breath of fresh air, his character is definitely far from revolutionary. The ""weak boy gradually turns strong over time"" formula has been done in a multitude of ways, a lot of which proving to be superior than in the case of Armin. However, I've really got no major complaints about his character. Cliche as it may, his development is infinitely more gradual and downright sublime when compared to most everyone else in the show and is probably only hindered by sometimes being overly smart for the sake of it and a lack of screen time. In other news, we also live in a world in which a character that is solely defined for eating potatoes is more universally liked than Armin by the community. Sometimes she eats a boiled potato, sometimes she settles for raw. Bravo, writers. You've really outdone yourselves with that one.
With an increased focus on the supporting cast, you'd think there would be someone worth noting, but there really isn't. We get absolutely no concise development for any of the shapeshifters, nor do we get any clarification as to what their motivates could be. How does Ymir's story intervene with Reiner's? Is Bertholdt even a character? Lastly, this whole ""Anyone can die at any given point"" gimmick is so untrue and falls completely flat when you realize that not once did a main character die and legitimately stay dead at any given point in the series. It is among the most substanceless claims someone can make about this show. Sure, fodder are often killed. Should you care? No. For a show that tackles a storyline of humanity at the brink of extinction, it sure is unrealistic for none of the main characters to ever actually die. The furthest the show has been willing to go up to this point was Marco, who was in essence a mere stepping stone for Jean throughout the 5 episodes he was in. I hope this false notion of AoT not being scared to kill anyone off disappears soon, because it is easily one of the most backwards things I've ever heard someone say about the show. More on Levi : The show's rising superstar isn't so rising anymore as he is down in the dumps and doesn't seem to be getting up anytime soon. Please check in later. Fin.
While the first season of Attack on Titan had many a gems like ""Reluctant Heroes"", ""Vogel im Käfig"" and the Armored Titan theme, this season has.. a remixed version of Vogel im Käfig? I'm gonna be blunt and say that the OST is underwhelming at best and a complete and utter rehash of its predecessor. Not once did I hear a song play and go ""Woah! That's a really good song that I just cannot wait to illegally download, awesome!!"" like with the first season. I saw the fine folk over at Reddit praising it so maybe I'm just dead wrong, who knows. For argument's sake let's assume that I am 100% in the right and the OST sucks dick and is the most overrated thing since Rem. Anyone with differing opinions may be burned at the stake. DAT VOGEL IM KAFIG REMIX THOOO. I was sold on every performance apart from Kamiya Hiroshi's Levi, because God damn, that man just has no range at all. Good thing he got barely any screentime this time around because honestly, no one wants to hear a brooding Araragi. Coincidentally, I would also argue for this being Yuki Kaji's best performance to date by a longshot, so good on him. Too bad the guy is like the arbiter of bad roles which becomes painfully noticeable once you realize Koichi was the probably the best he's ever been involved in. The ending is quite nice but the opening is very visually questionable, seeing as you have like dinosaurs running around and stuff. If they're so keen on regurgitating songs, maybe they should've just stuck with Guren no Yumiya. 
As disappointing as the music is, it completely flails in comparison to the animation. The last thing I would've expected AoT not to deliver on is the production value, but alas, here we are. After an upheaval of 4 years, Wit Studio has repeatedly been milking the saggy tit of this shriveled old cow, and shamelessly so. Even Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress who many, including myself had considered to be Attack on Titan's proudly retarded brother, still proved to be a commercial success within Japan. However, due to the low salary and therefore shortage of animators as well as a scary deadline or some stupid shit, we are left with no one to turn to but CGI. 𝘊𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘧𝘪𝘦𝘴
Now, this wouldn't have been so bad if it had been reduced to merely a couple of horses running about, but the Colossal titan? The biggest titan known to man looking like he came straight out of a Playstation game? They try covering it up pretty desperately by some cool 3D maneuver gear stunts, but whenever that giant red thing just pops up in the frame it takes me out of the moment entirely whilst completely ruining any immersion that might have previously been had, simultaneously leaving me mesmerized and ashamed to be part of the human race. Lowkey hyperbole aside, it was quite nice to see not as many individual still shots just placed randomly throughout like last season, which is pretty much the only improvement I can name. The titan designs still look as.. ""original"" as ever, ranging all the way from borderline creepy to mildly autistic, with few and far between.
Attack on Titan used to and still does hold a very special place in a lot of people's hearts for being that one big gateway show. Having watched it right after it finished airing, I still vivdly remember the passion and excitement I once felt towards it oozing out of every single pore of my body. Despite the numerous impressive feats it has managed to accumulate within the industry in terms of both financial value and Westernized viewership, the fact still remains that it is easily one of, if not the single most overrated anime of the past decade. Content-wise it is an absolute shitstain that treats itself way too seriously for its' own good when in reality is nothing more than an inconsistently entertaining dumb turd of an action series. The story is plagued by the author's raging boner for mysteries and unsolved plotpoints combined with annoying and overused distasteful flashbacks and especially cliffhangers that occur every single episode for the majority of the latter half of the season and exist solely to spray perfume over said previously aforementioned smelly turd in hopes of making an abundantly lackluster product seem a bit more refined. A cast of caricatures that by merely existing take a big gnarly dump all over the very concept of character development, with the typical consumer's reaction being, ""Man, did you see that? Levi just took out a QUADRILLION titans in the span of 5 seconds, I'm favoriting that man right this very instant !!! Oh, why is Armin scared?"" It's a failed rehash of the first season in every way imaginable and doesn't even compare to it in terms of hype or shock factor, the elements that initially gave the series limbs to stand on. Reiner is armored titen cuz he big and Bert is colossal cuz he tall, hurr durr. All in all, disappointing, but not unexpected. Fingers crossed that 2021 will be a better year for anime!",4

                Here it is after waiting for years or months for those who recently watched S1 (lucky you didn't wait over 3 years). I think we all have great expectations for this second season, but knowing it only has 12 episodes, it is a let down (for me anyway). ok let's start the review.
From what I watched so far I can say one thing... BRILLIANT, absolutely brilliant. Very well made and didn't change too much. Seeing the same old voices and characters after a long time brought back memories from when I watched it years ago, it was emotional for me. The creators took the first
                  season in consideration so we can experience the same thrills for the Opening and soundtracks. 
Straight off the bat, it's tense and keeps you at the edge of your seat. The one thing we are most likely happy about is that it's FINALLY telling us What the hell is going to happen. Not making any progress at a stage where we want to know more is annoying but we overcame that and now we can make progress in the plot. The events so far in this season is by far more interesting than anything that has happened so far in this series. It's not predictable and very entertaining. This just shows how much effort the studio put into this.
The sound is very similar to the first season, which is a very good thing. The opening and ending is too amazing for me to handle, I get shivers down my spine from watching them. The soundtracks make the fighting scenes so much better and it made me think, ""this is just like the first season"". The sound is one of the best aspects that beats the Manga to pulp 10x fold. I quit the Manga because I needed this.
The characters are the exactly the same. Seeing the same personalities after a long time is pure happiness. All the tension in the first few episodes brings out each characteristics, the emotions of fear and bravery that is. You get to see a new side to the characters, a side that you didn't know or could ever imagine. I was really shocked on episode 4, I didn't expect that character to be like that (don't want to spoil). 
The art is beautiful, the scenery and the characters are all perfect (for me anyway). The art of the unexpected appearance of Titan/s is really good. They just come out of no where and you see a giant Titan face still. The animation of them parts are 10/10. The animation is 100% satisfying and can't be anymore perfect for a plot like this.
I enjoyed this to a 10/10 level, everything has got me interested and I have to watch it on a big screen in 1080p with high volume or I won't be satisfied. Waiting for the next episode is absolute torture for me, I honestly think that this is the best anime of the season. I'm going to stop this paragraph here before I get off topic, don't want to go on and on u know.
You should watch this now and experience this amazing anime first hand. I recommend you go to 9anime. to and watch this on a big screen with high volume just like I do, it might change your watching experience. Anyway thanks for reading my review and I will update it through out my watch.

                Its actually painful how bad this series, and especially this season, is. I know a lot of people think I'm just being ridiculous and overreacting with a score of 1/10, but lets break this down and look at it piece by piece.
First off, the characters. Honestly how could anyone think any of these central characters are good? Eren is a whiny child who just screams for no reason the entire series, Armin is just unbearable, Mikasa was ok at first but immediately grew dull and boring, both her and Levi are Mary Sues who are inexplicably overpowered for no reason(other than being Asian... yeah that's
                  some inexcusably horrible writing right there). You know a series has massive issues when the only semi-likeable character is known for eating potatoes.
Next lets take a look at the concept and plot. The concept by itself isn't terrible, its similar to the beginning of some very good series like Gurren Lagann and Xenoblade Chronicles, but the author doesn't really develop anything from there. Now onto the plot.... It doesn't really have one. I know that seems like an exaggeration but it really isn't. In the first season the only events that pertain even remotely to any kind of central story was that Eren can turn into a titan, and so could others. That's it, that's literally it. That's unacceptable for a 25 episode season. If it had an arc-based story structure like Hunter x Hunter then that would be one thing, but it doesn't. Now in the 2nd season we're getting into all this political bullshit that still has nothing to do with any sort of central story, and even completely caught up in the manga it STILL doesn't have anything close to a central plot yet. I'm sorry but that's just terrible no matter how you look at it. Strangely enough, a large number of fans have told me that the plot is ""monsters are eating people""... that's not a plot, that's a concept.
Lets take a look at the actual writing quality. Now this part is mostly subjective but I might as well at least talk about it a little. The dialogue between characters is often incredibly bland and boring, but that pretty much goes along with the before mentioned bad characters. The writing for the plot is practically nonexistent as mentioned before, and the one time the author actually tried to advance the plot, it was done extremely poorly. I’m talking about when a certain someone decided to say “Oh hey btw I’m the armored titan, just thought you should know. Anyways I’m gonna go kill some people now, wanna come?” I’m not exaggerating when I say this is hands down the most horrendously written reveal I’ve ever seen in any form of media. Where was the motivation? Where was the build up? It honestly baffles me that fans are willing to defend this level of writing.
Furthermore, lets look at the method of combat for the series, even though there actually isn't much action throughout most of the series. The grappling hooks and duel wielding swords, admittedly an interesting concept at first glance, but in practice as an anime it just feels so repetitive after the first one or two times its done. They just zip around and go for the neck, zip around and go for the neck again, just the same thing over and over again. Its not clever, its not well written, its just boring. Now as bad as that was, the fact that Eren has the ability to turn into a titan actually makes it much worse. This completely erased the significance of the only decent arc in the entire series, the training camp. This arc was the only time Eren was even a remotely good and interesting protagonist. He struggled in a way that people can relate to, and he worked hard to improve himself when it came to mastering the gear. Then the moment he turned into a titan, all that just got thrown out the window and he's been his old annoying self ever since.
Everyone salivates about the animation quality and soundtrack of the series, particularly from the first season, but animation quality doesn't mean anything when nothing of interest ever happens during the series, and not to mention there has been a pretty sharp decline in animation quality this season. The AoT OST isn't bad in the sense that it created appealing music, but the composer did a horrible job creating music that fits well with the series. I'm convinced the only reason people like this series as much as they do is because of the openings, which make it feel like its an intense action-packed series, when in reality its nothing but a poorly written drama with horrible characters. Seriously, the OST would be better suited for a video of a guy eating hotdogs than AoT itself.",1
"
                I rewatch the last minutes of the previous episode (episode 6) and realize that AoT is ~~THE MOST EPIC ANIME!!~~ It's not the best, but the epicness of that is beyond believe!! and it's achieved by the several things - first is music, OSTs and OPENINGS of both seasons troghout the series is OUTSTANDING that emphisize all the drama main characters face and it may be does not make you cry, but the heartbreak is guaranteed for you. The second is art - I think that compared to manga it is evaluated as much as it could be evaluated!! As titans supposed to be the
                  drama, the eyes and faces of characters describe it perfectly, I don't even talk about fights and others..Overall, of you would like to see what life you DEFINITELY don't want to live i RECOMMEND to watch to get high! I am sure you will be shocked in the most positive way!!!",10
"
                Another fantastic anime finished and now we wait for the next season which was confirmed will be in 2018. Yet again, I'm writing this review as an au courant with the manga. I'll try my best to not include spoilers. Hahaha. Anyhoo, here I go. Please bear with me. 
Story: 10000000/10
This season proved yet again that SNK is not about all the titan action. I noticed that there are a lot of 'salty fans' whining that this season is lacking a lot of action, so they rated it 1-4, or at least 5 because they feel like being nice despite the fact that they don't
                  give a damn about all the important dialogues. Alright.. alright.. I've had enough with them action-tards, I'll just move on. 
This season lived up to the hype of every SNK fan, especially the manga readers. Remember, fellow readers how anxious we are before the season 2 release because the manga is so great that we're worried that Wit Studio might messed it up and make it like ""Tokyo Ghoul season 2""? No worries anymore, lads! They satisfied us. This studio satisfied us. The people behind the adaptation of the manga didn't disappoint us. They made us cry. They made us hurt our hands from clapping throughout the episode. We're all okay. Everyone's okay! Everyone's happy! *hugs you all*
Art: 10/10
C'mon. Do I really have to point out that this anime probably has the best ANIMATION EVER? Look at them beautiful characters and the action sequence. Come on now. Oh, you think this season's animation is awful compare to the previous season? Give us a favor and clean your glasses. 
Sound: 10/10
Honestly, the soundtrack for this season ain't like the 1st season, but no doubt Hiroyuki Sawano proved again why he's THE HANS ZIMMER OF THE EAST! No comments further. Just hands down to our own HANS ZIMMER! 
Character: 10/10
This is probably the only anime which I can remember all of the characters' names -- which you can tell how well-written and how memorable the characters are. Character developments not just from the MCs, but also the supporting characters? You got it!
One of the biggest factors that makes this show so iconic is because of its characters; everyone loves every character in this show. 
Even the bad ones, you get to like them. Darnit this anime.
Enjoyment: 10/10
An anime that will make you cry, hurt your insides, leave you traumatized, and you will be thankful for it? Hell to the yeah! Torture us more, please!
Overall: 10000000000/10
Jesus. This anime is just the G.O.A.T. for me! And I loved that this anime is getting everything it deserves like the fans, the hype, the attention, the awards, and etc. Let's be honest, SNK brought a lot of non-anime fans in the anime universe. 
If you're hating on this season because of the plot holes and the unanswered questions, I suggest start reading the manga?
LOVE TO ALL THE SNK HATERS! Keep on hating, you're just making this anime more popular!
Now, my fellow SNK-tards, it's time to buy them all SNK merch and the DVD, and of course time to mark your calendars because we're gonna have A SEASON 3!
P.S. Thanks for reading my ridiculously long review, but I will always give my best to prove to all the d-bags who keep hating on this show because they thought it didn't deserve the praises it's been getting that this show is one, if not the greatest anime EVER!",10
"
                The amazing sequel to attack on titan 1! Love the opening and great show, but the Beast Titan deserves a white van to go with his creepy smile and voice. Epic characters, especially Levi (I know Eren can be a bit whiny at times, but his rage kind of makes him a suitable protagonist for a post-apocalyptic anime.) and epic soundtrack. I've read the manga and it's so good to see it in full colour and animated. 10/10, best anime after Sword Art Online. Ending theme is good too, but it kind of spoils the titans creation for those who haven't read the manga to
                  the end. Good fight scenes and good gore.",10
"
                To all of you who rates this less than 7 and says it's the same as season 1:
You have no idea. I know it feels ""mediocre"" the first 5 eps of s02, but if you think the story doesn't develop or characters doesn't develop, then you have 0 idea of the series. And if you compare this kind of anime to gundam and tengen toppa gurren lagann and other completely different genres, then don't write reviews. You need to put it in the RIGHT context. Let me tell you, if you stop watching here, you're missing out. It's not about the action or the flashy
                  Anime-Michael-Bay-effects, it's all about the plot.
I have read the manga, without any spoilers i'm just gonna leave it there. 
This season has just getting started, the 6th episode is a starter.",10
"
                Earlier before Shingeki No Kyojin (SnK) Season 2 started in April, Wit Studio launched a cheeky full page ad on the Japanese newspaper apologising to the public on how the weekly airing of AoT episodes may impact their social life. Most fans would have brush this off as an air of arrogance and bragging from the Studio team, after all Wit Studio has kept SnK fans waiting for season 2 for almost 4 years and clearly the hypes has somewhat dies down a lot since. To made matter worse, there were only 12 episodes announced which was enough material to just to cover the Clash
                  of Titan Story Arc (Manga Chapter 34-50).Lots of fan were clearly disappointed when hearing this news but to me after finished watching the 6th episodes, my disappointment has turn into excitement because Season 2 will probably goes down as one of the best season ever.
So what have changed between Season 1 and Season 2 during the 4 year MIA? Lets discuss:
Story
We continue from last season shocking ending reveal where we found out what's hiding behind the huge walls that has been protecting the remains of humanity from Titan. The Scouting Legion have also make progress by capturing Annie who is the Female Titan with great sacrifices but were not able to find out anything further due to Annie enclosing herself in an unbreakable crystal prison.
In Season 2, we start off with the opening episode with news of Titans appearance but the mysteries deepens when the soldier were unable to find the wall that was broken.
As some of the old mysteries are resolved, more questions/strange mysteries appears just like the Beast Titan appearance which gives user more room to conjure up new theories about AoT. Brilliant 
If you have not read the manga, be prepare for more shocking reveals especially on the quest to reach Eren home basement where the biggest mysteries is
I would give the scores for the story segment a 5 out of 5.
Art
No doubt the artwork have maintained the highest quality in anime standard and i do sincerely believe the artwork actually surpass Season 1. 
The atmosphere in the night scenes looks spooky and the new titans are actually kind of terrifying to the viewers. The only downside I have is the frequent use of CG but it is not so bad in my opinion as the animation team need to handle their limited budget for each episode carefully. Anime viewers need to pay close attention to the details like the scenery to truly enjoy each AoT episodes. Also I love the new camera angle put into the animation this season. 
I would give the scores for the art segment a rating of 4.5 / 5
Sound
This area is where Snk shines the most irregardless of OP/ED themes, sound effects, or voice acting. 
The new OP sung by Linked Horizon is great and it will slowly grows on you while the new ED is creepy but in a good way that it leave an impression on the viewer. 
Some of the BG has been reused from Season 1 but there is also new remix and new BG heard for this season which fits into the anime perfectly.
I really can`t wait to get hold of the new SnK album release this June 2016.
I would give the scores for the sound segment a rating of 4.5 / 5
Character
Season 1 focus more on the main trio which is Eren, Armin and Mikasa whereas Season 2 is expanding on the backstory for the side character like Sasha, Connie, Reiner, Bertolt, Ymir and Christa. I`m glad that Isayama build up the side characters which made us sympathies to their back story as the story progress.
rate: 4/5
Enjoyment
Season 2 start a bit slower in the beginning but things are going to go wild with the remaining 6 episodes. I sincerely believe that there is a chance that Season 2 has every reasons to top Season 1.
Will continue to watch this till it ends in 6 weeks. Hopefully we don`t have to wait for too long for Season 3.",10
"
                TL;DR: Does it really matter what I write? You have waited 4 years, endured 2 trashy live action movies and restrained yourself from reading the manga to find out what's in Erin's basement. So go watch the anime to find that answer! But knowing you, you will stick around and read this review. So in short, Game of Thrones meets Inception/Memento and has a forbidden love-child they didn't reveal to the world because they were scared it will not live up to hype and success of their first child. 
[Story: 5/10 , Characters: 7/10, Art: 9/10, Sound: 8/10, Enjoyment: 8/10]
How can an anime as bombastic
                  & overhyped as Shingeki no Kyojin live up to its thrilling sadistic nature? Simple, wait four years, give it to the same director and shove in a billion flashbacks while compressing more manga material than season 1 with 25 episodes into just 12 episodes in season 2 and hope for deus ex machina to save the day. Seriously, this anime was the talk of the town as it took the anime world by storm. The creators milked so much money out of it before releasing the sequel, 4 whole years later, that you would think they will be nice? Of course not. These sadistic people just love to torture everyone, both inside their post-apocalyptic world and outside. However, you should watch it, not because you will but because you have to… if you want to know what's in that god-damn basement. 
Story wise, the anime picks up literally where it left off in season 1. We see a smooth continuation and no pumping the breaks. Titans don't pump their breaks, why should you? We have a new threat and it's the all powerful Monkey Titan. He is blessed with both brain & braum that likes to fling things with perfect precision like a quarterback trying to score a touchdown. This titan means no monkey business for he is bringing an army to take down humanity. How will our soldiers stand up against him? By focusing completely on other issues besides him in this anime, like why everyone wants Krista as their waifu. Jokes aside, this anime is broken down in two arcs and the second arc is more focused on the secondary characters with a new threat being ""now anyone can be a Titan."" Seriously, people are just popping out of nowhere revealing they are a Titan and it keeps us on the edge trying to figure out who is and who isn't a titan. Unlike first season, where it was all action & thrill, this season the story moves at a slower pace that builds this mystery horror element and viewers feel the genuine terror of living in this post-apocalyptic world where anything can happen. However, the glaring issue is the amount of flashbacks that are in each episodes. It almost ruins it. We will have an episode where titans have surrounded the characters and they are about to fight only to cue in a flashback of epic unnecessary proportion that really doesn't do much. Just because it works a few time doesn't mean you should always do it. Seriously, Tetsurou Araki, just stop it. Also, the anime is not presented in a linear pattern like in the manga as the director jumps from chapter 30 to chapter 50 back to chapter 40. It was a clusterfudge but it worked… somehow. The twists and turns were there but the best part was the obvious reveal that was brilliantly executed to leave a mark for a long time. 
Regardless of how bizarre the storytelling was for this season, the character development this season was on point. The studio heard the fans anguish and completely removed Erin from the first half of the anime and focused entirely on the side characters. We not only learn the purpose or goal behind the major side characters but their past history that shaped them to be this way. Their actions actually makes sense. Now we will feel some remorse when they may or may not die in the future unlike in season 1 where viewers just laughed at random characters getting devoured by titans. Mikasa transforms into this full yandere GF that no guys should date and Krista becomes the waifu people will change their sexuality to be with her. Sadly we don't see much of Levi nor gladly we see much of Erin. However, the latter change was better for the anime. Erwin is a complete badass and as the anime goes on, viewers will know why. All I'll say is *SUSUMEEEE* !!! 
 To no one's surprise, the saving grace for this anime is once again their animation and sound. Wit Studio, despite working with a questionable lower budget, manages to deliver phenomenal animation. The manga is really well adapted frame for frame and the hand-drawn animation is vibrant and rich in colour & texture. You have to see it in 1080p or you will be doing yourself injustice. The characters, the titans, the backgrounds, the cinematography and the fighting animations are just on fleek. Anyone who will watch the judo fight between the two titans will get a massive something just watching it. If they weren't pulling breaks with the animation the sound wasn't either. The OP & ED songs were first hard to get accustomed to since no OP songs can live up to its first but it grows on you. The background OST is utterly horrifying as it builds this terror with its sadistic tone. You have to love orchestra based OST. It's truly revolutionizing. Most anime sequels suffer in this department but thankfully SnK 2 did not, and it made their transition fluid.  
Overall, this show is has its flaws but you can just enjoy it for what it is. It's not a masterpiece but it's highly enjoyable.  It is infuriating for a viewer to be edged and edged with endless cliffhanger style episodes but ultimately you finish it anyway because who edges themselves to the point of no return and not finish, right? So, Is attack on titan overrated? Debatable. Is attack on titan overhyped? Unquestionable. Is it still a show you would love to binge? Definitely! Anyways, give it a watch and let me know later how you like it. *SHINZUO SASAGEYO!!!*
P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!",7
"
                The sequel to Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyoujin was probably the most awaited anime series of the decade. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that because the first season just made a stupendous impact on the anime industry. Fans waited, and waited, and waited, for a second season to come and after four long years(God knows what the studio was doing for this long), we finally got a second season to one of our favorite, or for some people, one of their most hated anime. 
And let me tell you, as a huge fan of the first season and the series
                  in general, Attack on Titan Season 2 is a colossal disappointment. The hype that most people had, or at least that I had, was already dissipated when a few days before the anime was to begin, it was announced that this season was going to be one cour. This wasn't just because it was a kick in the backside for those who've patiently waited for four years to only get 12 episodes, but also because those who've read the manga knew that 12 episodes would only let the plot hanging and would move the story nowhere. Unless they skipped lots of details, there was no way we were going to get the action and excitement that we'd longed for after having finished season 1. 
I put this behind me, like a lot of others, and made up my mind that 12 episodes were better than nothing. 
The season started in an explosive way and made me remember once again why I loved season 1 so much. The titans, the screams, the expressions of terror on the faces of characters, the fear that one of the characters that I liked might die. All these things along with the amazing battles were the reason why Season 1 had become one of my favorites. And we were thrown into it right away. 
As the season progressed though, the story began to stagnate and the fears that I held before the season began surfaced. The story just went nowhere. By the time I was at episode 10, I was already not following the series weekly. There were episodes in between that gave me the chills and the feels of the first season and I couldn't help but crave for more when I watched those episodes/scenes. But they were far too little. And I knew that this would be the case for most of the season. The manga content that was adapted for Season 2 was mostly exposition and the action was nowhere near enough to satisfy my thirst. It just had those long minutes of silence, which to be honest isn't what Attack on Titan is, or what made it so successful in the first season. 
On to the characters, this is an area that was probably the most disappointing for me along with the lack of action. If they could've had character development done well through the course of the 12 episodes, I think that might've made up for the lack of action. For me though, this didn't happen. Our protagonists Eren and Mikasa don't change. They didn't change much throughout Season 1, but you could excuse that. However, the utter lack of character development for anyone, even our protagonists is extremely disappointing. Eren never grows out of his ""I'll erase every titan off the face of the earth"" shit, and he doesn't really even try to think of reasons why Titans exist. He's just obsessed with killing them and that's all there is to him in the season. Mikasa doesn't get too much screentime but even she's the same ""Eren I'll protect you from the world"". The only characters that did get somewhere were Krista Lenz and Ymir. I thought they were fleshed out pretty well and had their past revealed a little bit. 
Having said all that, the animation of Season 2 just went up a notch from Season 1, and Season 1 was done pretty darn well. The art was detailed and the animation fluid. The OST was similar to season 1 with some differences added. They let us get a feel of the events happening extremely well and help up immerse in the world of titans. Both of these get almost a perfect score.
Now, I did enjoy certain parts of Attack on Titan Season 2, but overall, it was a real disappointment for a fan. It had its moments when it caught me in the scene and had an effect similar to that of Season 1, however those moments were far too sparse. I'm predicting and hoping that Season 3 will be much more action packed and have our characters develop more. Even if the season was 2 cour, we were always going to have these episodes where the world was explained to us in the first cour, but we wouldn't have to wait another ......so many years to get to the real stuff. 
Anyway, if you liked the first Season, you must watch this(as you will, haha), because I'm sure whatever they have in store for Season 3 is going to be better than this, at least for me.",7
"
                Updated version of my previous top review:
SnK season 2 has been a rough ride. As a fan of season 1, I really wanted this season to be good. On one hand, the latter half of the season was action packed and full of great development - just what I wanted. On the other, the first half of the season was extremely poorly written. 
So I'll separate this review into two halves.
1st half (ep 1-6)
First of all, don't expect the world to be well built or realistic. After all, there are absolutely no men guarding the wall, as the entire ordeal within the first few episodes
                  revolves around them trying to find a hole in the wall, even though there should be men constantly guarding the wall in case of a surprise titan invasion. If there weren't men guarding the wall, then that would mean that they thought it was impossible for the titans to break through the wall - which would mean their first thoughts shouldn't have been that the titans just broke straight through the wall with a huge hole. In fact, the only men you really get to see this season are those from the recon corps. I, personally, like to believe that everyone else has been wiped out by some sort of plague or meteor shower. The plot progresses so messily this season that it's certainly possible; but I'll cover that later.
For the first time we also get to explore the land outside of the enclosed town districts, and it isn't really what you'd expect. Do you remember that food shortage from season 1? Well, rest assured, it makes perfect sense - considering there is absolutely NO farmland present at all; so of course they wouldn't be able to get food. You'd imagine that inside the walls, with such limited space that the humans have, there would be loads of farms and towns - but you're wrong. There are no towns, or cities, and the only places we do see are remote villages for some reason. In addition, the only time farmland is actually addressed is when Sasha's village forest is going to be destroyed and replaced with farmland, because apparently no one can use the wide open fields with absolutely NOTHING on them. 
Speaking of Sasha, prepare for a bunch of random background character backstories to be thrown in for no reason. I watched the entire second season and I still don't know what the purpose of Sasha's backstory was, and I don't know what an entire episode was dedicated just to focus on her. Actually, to be honest, I don't even know why Sasha exists as a character. The constantly-eating gimmick isn't even funny. 
I've heard a lot of people talk about how they enjoyed the fact that more of the background characters were focused on this season - mostly because they hate Eren as a protagonist. First of all, to those types, I recommend you abandon the show all together because Eren will never develop as a protagonist. The entire season 2 went by and Eren received no character development as far as I could tell. He's still the same ""kill all titans!"" kinda guy he was last season.
The side characters aren't any better though. If you expect proper character development, suspense, and gradually building up towards climactic scenes full of emotion, then throw your dreams out the window. Character development is done almost exclusively through flashbacks, and those flashbacks happen right during the most important reveals and climactic scenes they could manage. There are quite a few times where entire scenes will be ruined by an disruptive flashback or ""12 hours ago"" message because the writers seemingly FORGOT to develop the characters or information leading up to the scenes. Reveals lack any subtlety or suspense in this show. They throw information at you in an extremely rushed and disorderly fashion. Also, you end up feeling nothing towards the side characters because the only time they're developed is through very unoriginal events like a FLASHBACK TO TRAINING CAMP WHERE TWO GIRLS GOT LOST IN A BLIZZARD. You DEFINITELY haven't heard of something like that before.  
Oh, by the way, for all of you who took an interest in Annie - forget about her. They do nothing with her the entire season and just forget about her. 
So, yeah, for the first six episodes the story is a complete mess. 
There's a concerning absence of people in the universe and the flow of the story has killed all momentum. Don't expect any of the good aspects of season 1 to be present.
Now, as for the rest of the season? Well, it gets a lot better. Suddenly the authors remember how to do unobtrusive flashbacks and character development. The characters are cool and a lot of the nice aspects from season one are able to be seen, along with a new mix of more fleshed out side characters. 
Plus, the art is WAY upgraded. There has been some great scenes in this show. 
As for the sound? The opening isn't actually good, though you get used to it after a while. The ED, which I accidentally ended up listening to when I forgot to click onto the next episode, was terrible. The regular OST is cool as usual.
So, yeah, season 2 had a really disappointing first half and a decent second half. Nonetheless, the unforgivable start makes me have to leave this on a 6/10.",6
"
                TLDR Second Season wasn’t as good as the first. It was slow paced, didn’t have nearly as much action, and focused mainly on character development. The opening song goes back to the show’s origins by having a opening track that sound incredibly similar to the first theme. Probably one of this season’s biggest drawbacks is that all of season two basically happened in a single romeo-juliet-styled week (all of Romeo and Juliet took place in about one week). Because of the slowness, it wasn’t nearly as exciting as season one which showcased the mysterious nature of walls getting kicked down by abnormal titans and other
                  titans further destroying a civilization that’s already cornered. In season one, we watched as Eren grew into a soldier, saw Mikasa’s badassery, met Levi who was even more of a badass, and there was so much we didn’t know about the AoT world. Sadly, you don’t really get much of that fast paced intensity this time. 
Story: 6/10
The entire 12-episode season basically takes place in about a week in the show’s time. Right after season one ends and Annie is locked up somewhere out of sight, Eren is off recovering in bed. Various things happen like flipping titans, and more human transforming titans. This season focuses more on the side characters of the series than the main characters from the original series.
Apart from the story only being about a week in length, we only saw flashbacks of the past to build the characters. Personally, I hate flashbacks but some of the flashbacks of certain characters’ pasts were necessary to the story. This season, we only got to see Eren transform like one time the ENTIRE season. Eren was annoying as hell this season and felt like more of a side character than a main character. The only relatively shocking thing was a big reveal that happened suddenly and unexpectedly. If this was a 24 episode season, then it would’ve been fine to have such prolonged character development. However, since it was 12 episodes, it was bit of a let down for me. Going to have to give this category a six.
Characters: 8/10
The characters all seemed to have real depth and personalities. Personally, I do not like Eren Jaeger much anymore because he was pretty damn annoying the entire season. However, despite disliking him he still comes across as a realistic character with real flaws. One of this show’s strong points is that all of the characters have a good amount of depth to them. However, it seemed like this season didn’t really make full use of the personalities of more prominent characters like Levi, Hange, Mikasa, Armin and Eren.
Art: 9/10
The art seems to be about the same as the first season’s art. There are some times when the titans are noticeably CG. For example, you would probably easily be able spot the difference between the CG and the hand drawn art, and that difference was pretty awkward at times. Other than that the art is still the great art that you remember from season one. The lighting is top quality, the angles are super impressive, action leaves you sitting on the edge of your chair, etc. 
Sound: 9/10
The in-anime soundtracks are pretty much the same as season one. Sawano Hiroyuki composed the soundtracks so you can expect them to be cinematic, powerful, and punchy. The voice actors/actresses all did a fantastic job this season as well as the first. You really feel the emotions of each character come through in their voices. Sound effects were all top quality as well. 
Enjoyment: 7/10
I don’t really like how slow it was this season. It ended much too soon, and was kind of a let down in my opinion. All of that fast-paced story buildup in season one, followed by the most epic fight scene at the end… followed abnormally slow character development season two and has an ending buildup that kind of felt like it should’ve been a normal episode, not the climax? I just can’t give this any higher than a 7 for enjoyment.
Overall: 8/10
Despite that show having some serious pacing issues and focusing too much on character development, the show was actually pretty good overall, as you would expect from one of the most famous anime series.",8
"
                Attack on Titan has an unfortunate truth surrounding it. Critics and fanboys surmise their opinions, incessantly hurling them at each other in hopes of smothering people into submission. One thing not present enough with this anime is a middle ground. In Season 2 we saw a surprising 12 episodes, a missing producer and a far different plot direction. The question is, did these things work for or against the franchise, and is it still the same old AoT that millions of viewers addictively engulfed several years ago? I feel it’s time to address the elephant in the room and provide a brutally honest review of
                  the anime, and stop populating MAL with reviews embellished with buzzworthy absolutes like “the show is shit” or “arguably the best written series of all time”.
DISCLAIMER- This is a very honest review. You’ve been warned.
Right off the bat, the viewers are thrown into the second season with one of the worst transitions I can remember. I actually went back and watched the final episode of Season 1 followed by the first of Season 2 and was blown away by how disjointed it flows. So many unanswered questions (the walls, what exactly happened to Annie, how Eren feels about the whole thing) filled the air that I honestly couldn’t keep up with them all. It was a complete trainwreck. Possibly part of the issue is due to some changes in staffing regarding the anime, but it’s evident something went wrong. In this season, the viewers experience some short, but detailed backstory on Connie, Sasha, Ymir and others. Unfortunately, with the evident time pressure, it detracted largely from the story. The pacing is lethargic, often focusing on key battle scenes in order to create the facade that the plot is moving forward. It’s extremely hard to tell how much time is elapsing between various events, and as the final episode concluded, to have waited 4 years for what we got is embarrassing. 
Possibly the most glaring inadequacy is the truncated 12 episodes this season. In an anime with such a large cast as this, it really isn't enough time to get the job done. For the sake of metaphoric comparisons I could equate Attack on Titan’s short run time to my own high school reunion. In essence you have two hours to talk to about 50 people, and before you know it you've relinquished a bulk of your time catching up with one or two people. This results in a speedy greeting for the remainder, or you possibly not talking to them at all. This is precisely what the writers were forced to do with much of the anime’s cast. Characters like Levi and Armin make mere cameos, and the season spends most of its time progressing a short amount of actual story. The plot also suffers, as events can’t be properly explained within the amount of time 12 episodes allots. 
WARNING- SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH
The one aspect I can’t forgive from a writing perspective is how sloppy the Bertolt and Reiner reveal was. Similar to some complaints I had about Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, it seemed to come so far out of left field that it felt reactionary. I understand the manga already contained this part of the story, but the appearance in the anime seemed sporadic and unexplained. It’s one thing to leave your audience questioning and on suspense, but another to come off as contrived or “simply doing things because the manga had it here in the timeline”. I felt much more surprised at Ymir’s titan introduction since I completely forgot she even existed. She was made to be a one-off character in my eyes, but as she transformed, her relationship with Krista and ghostly appearances all started to click. Bertolt and Reiner just doesn’t make sense to me. Hopefully, this gets cleaned up in Season 3 but it would’ve been a lot more cohesive without as much perceived randomness.
OKAY, NO MORE SPOILERS! YOU’RE SAFE NOW!
The more Attack on Titan progresses, the bigger issues I develop for Eren. In the anime’s infancy I thought Eren could become more than the trope he seems to currently be fitting. Ah, the revenge-blinded hero that will do anything to stop his foes… I can’t say I’ve ever heard of this before! He’s transforming into an angstier version of Kirito. Instead of just being the best at everything he does, Eren often gets beat, whines about it, recovers and then Leroy Jenkins’ his way back into combat again. There’s no internal dilemmas, no monologues about how he’s feeling (sans one instance in this seasons when everyone’s getting attacked at the end), just a vanilla-scripted MC. At least Mikasa maintains some enigmatic qualities by not continuously shooting her mouth off with an angry case of tourettes.
If there is one thing the producer got right, it’s the action. Attack on Titan features some of the best choreographed fight scenes in anime, and Season 2 dials up the gore to 11. The emotions of the characters in battle are raw and realistic, with each spurt of adrenaline properly conveyed to the viewer. However, by saying this I also acknowledge how much the series is lacking in almost every other facet. It’s becoming that flashy toy kids play with for 5 minutes until they realize it only does about one thing. There’s no thinking involved, the foreshadowing is haphazard or non-existent, and it’s really unfortunate to see. With the budget this franchise has, it could easily hold the same uniform public praise as a show like Game of Thrones. The animation, story and characters COULD ALL BE EXCELLENT. But alas, we are left with luke-warm excitement and thoughts of how it could be better.
I hope I’m not the only one that noticed the cringeworthy CGI involving the colossal titan during the 5th or 6th episode. Certainly an example of CG done wrong. However, while omitting this error, the anime’s art style seems relatively intact. The color palette still consists of opaque shades of brown, gray and green, with special attention given to character expressions and action scenes. The shots of a parade of Survey Corps members stampeding on horseback, or the ominous backdrop of roaming titans still launches AoT into a league of its own in the art direction category. Action scenes are fluid and suspenseful, and the gore is still as ubiquitous as the first season. I can only hope that as the series continues and media technology advances, the art directors stay true to their roots in this series, because a style that so accurately emulates its subject matter can be hard to come by.
The music is epic once again. Linked Horizon returns to delight us with their fanfarish ballad to open the anime. “Sasageyo, sasageyo!” The remaining OST is fitting and seeks to emphasize the emotion present within its corresponding scene. Though, I will admit that I didn’t get the same sense of urgency or fear the background music portrayed during some of the more chaotic instances in Season 1. Nothing extremely offputting, but noticeable nonetheless. AoT’s seiyuus continue to impress with their grit and raw, emotional talent. Yuki Kaji’s resounding screams as Eren are evidence of his talent, and Hiroshi Kamiya is always smug and serious as Levi. I can only imagine how much fun the actors had when making this series, in terms of being able to use their full abilities. 
With any anime, my level of enjoyment is the most important factor when determining whether or not I’d recommend something. For the bulk of AoT fans, the second season will “partially” fill the void that the last 4 years since the anime’s debut has left. For some of you, possibly the more analytical types, the flaws begin to pile up. An extremely short runtime, half-assed character development and transition issues from the first season all work against AoT in this installment. Personally I enjoy the series, the world it exists in and the action, but Studio Wit is going to have to give the next season a much better effort if it wants to ensure its fans stay hungry for more, and have a more consistent adaptation schedule. Delaying one of the most popular anime in history for the trainwreck (pun intended) Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress in 2016 isn’t a good place to start. AoT always gets my blood pumping with its suspense and enthralling fight scenes, but can it keep the consistency? Hopefully Season 2 is not a precursor for things to come...

"
                So I've just watched the seventh episode, and decided I absolutely had to write a review of this masterpiece... so far. 
Story(10): This is the part that shines I believe, the use of mystery in the plot so that the characters know things the audience doesn't, and it is revealed after an event is amazing. The amount of jaw dropping twists that have happened so far just makes the show so much more enjoyable, as it builds up the drama and then pours everything out at once. The pacing this season is perfect. Nothing is too drawn out but just long enough to show its
                  relevance to the series overall, and to keep it enjoyable at the same time. Finally the fight scenes, wow. Most won't realize that all of the stances and grappling that goes on, are actual fighting stances mixed martial artist use. They could have just put monsters fighting like they always do in anime, but to go that extra step and show the different positions shows some serious commitment to go the extra mile, and personally the fights seem must better because of it. 
Art(10): Sublime art, I'd say even better than the first season. The detail in the eyes and facial expressions is in a category of its own as far as I'm concerned. And just from a directing standpoint the angles and shots that are drawn are perfect, exacerbating the intensity of each situation.
Sound(10): The music is amazing, just the the first season. The use of choirs creates a feeling of euphoria and excitement, which just adds to the overall enjoyment of the anime. 
Characters(9): Another category in which the character development is a step above. The focus has been taken off of Eren and spread around to the secondary characters which thickens the plot because of their mysterious connection, which wasn't even hinted at in the first season. Getting into the characters heads trying to understand what their thinking, and looking back at their behaviour before and how it relates to their current position makes the viewer think harder and mentally stimulates you more than basically every shonen anime out there. Also The real moral dilemmas that develop are superb. The only reason this category is a 9 is because of the lesser focus, and therefore, not as much development on the main characters. Though this is only do to time constraints of developing the other characters, and is only the 7th episode so it could pick up before the end.    
Enjoyment(10): If you have gotten this far you probably can tell how much I've enjoyed AoT season 2.  
Overal(10): Outstanding series, outstanding season, just please watch it and try and enjoy it rather than search for every little error, just because you don't like how much everyone else loves this series.",10
"
                I'll definitely make a full review once the show has finished airing but Shingeki No Kyojin is a type of anime that expects you to be hyped, too much hype based ,after reading the Manga which is more interesting then the anime itself, i barely saw any of these scenes in the Manga for season 2 , Shingeki No Kyojin was a let down for me and had a significant impact on the way I'd enjoy the anime, hence the reason I'm not excited for the anime but will end up completing it.
The first season was off edged on the performance of each episode ,
                  did not show it's potential and flaws it could of had , with only showing that Humanity had Humans who could transform into titans which was a good flaw.
The Second season however is still in continuity of following season one , but has progressed through the current episodes which show new encounters of particular scenes and chasing towards a more loss of hope for Humanity in Shingeki No Kyojin.
The Story is slowly getting more disappointing each episode , there is no plot twist yet after 29 episodes including the first season , just the same of titans eating people ,i dislike this because nothing is getting more interesting besides character (Eren Yeagar) doing nothing but seeking attention and screaming half of the time during the anime.
In Shingeki no Kyojin it's basically a maze not just a picture of maze and think someone is lost in the maze , but Character wise and their choices , they're lost they dont even know who built their castle walls , they look at the world as in a kid version still knowing nothing but killing titans and hiding from them.
SnK is one of those animes that seem like there is no hope in that world and they know it yet continue to fight but only to be eaten by titans.
Characters: 5
Eren Yeagar hasn't developed as much as i'd expected from being a wuss , he's still being dependent, has the ability still to help his friends , can be stubborn and continuity of change 
throughout his story.
Armin Arlert still reluctant from season 1 but improving with his skills to help Eren , he has potential to become a good character in time of Shingeki no Kyojin.
Mikasa Ackerman is a continuation of becoming boring each episode from not showing her potential but to follow Eren and Scout corps, besides in season one was quite interesting to look at , i do not find her any worth this season so far.
Overall:
There are quite some good genre moments from what I've seen my enjoyment is in the average category, i hope this anime will improve one day, for attack on titans (Shingeki) i lack the past of what has happened as i didn't enjoy Shingeki no Kyojin as much as i thought i would.",6
"
                A review of Shingeki no Kyojin S2: We talk too much edition
Some spoilers ahead - either cherish the memory of SnK and remember it as a good anime or watch S2 and be dissatisfied (disappointment levels may wary)
SnK2 is like the anime version of last year's game No Man's Sky, but not in the sense that the game didn't deliver the promises, but in that it was such a huge letdown. Both products were dragged and produced for a long time, both of them were hyped to the next level and both of them disappointed. 1st season of SnK was great - it had a
                  very good balance of story, character development and action. SnK2, on the other hand, has failed in all of these aspects. It's a huge mess and it doesn't deliver.
Every story has main points, where it's already decided, what's going to happen at those very points. Everything in-between is filler, not the Naruto type of filler, but the one that expands and branches out the story, further developing it. SnK main points were obvious - Titans suddenly attack, Erin's and Mikasa's mother is killed, they join the army, and so on. Filler tells us about their backgrounds, stories, feelings, adding extra spice to the story (Erin's hate for the Titans, Mikasa's overprotectiveness, etc.). SnK2 has barely any main points, therefore getting these huge gaps, which have to be filled, and boy does the filling stink. We keep all these new facts and information randomly being thrown at us, without the show expanding on them. Oh, there are Titans IN THE DAMN WALL?! No, have this sudden Titan attack, the wall will never get mentioned again. There might be another hole in the wall? Na, we will mention it once it's irrelevant, have this unnecessarily long background story of Sasha which you will forget anyway. This keeps going on for the rest of show, barely any answers are given to various questions from the first season and another 100 is thrown at us in the second. The pacing and random story cuts add even more salt to this, making the narrative very unenjoyable.
So the story is a mess, maybe characters can compensate for this? Nope, everyone just talks a lot. Multiple episodes has everyone talking endlessly until finally we're woken up by a potential action sequence, which then cuts into credits, leaving us confused. And since everyone talks so much, you'd think it's about something important, but trust me, you'll catch yourself skipping through their dialogues because they don't say anything. At first you'll care about what everyone's saying, but later on you'll realize you heard this many times already. Unlike in SnK, SnK2 character development is horrid, filled with tons of unnecessary dialogue and very random background information, which instead of evolving personalities, ruins them.
Appreciate those few action sequences you'll get, because they get replaced by sputter real fast.
So is there anything good about this show? Yes, the art is same as it was in SnK, which is liked by many. Can't say I enjoyed the ""Sound"" aspect of this show, because it was all just talking.
In conclusion, SnK2 is a huge disappointment, failing to continue the story and further character developement of the first season miserably. If SnK was a well balanced sandwich, SnK2 is a rotten delivery from the start.",3

                [5.0/10]
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
For a series that's all about a plethora of characters yelling loudly,  Attack on Titan definitely finds itself whining a lot this season. Even with the aptly titled final episode, ""Scream"", AoT rarely finds breathing room to develop its scenario or characters past bluntly exposited backstory or nauseatingly boring dialogue. For everything it lacks in subtlety, it thankfully makes up for in bravado, as this season, even in its shorter length, is louder, dumber, and more abrasive than the last. 
Don't get me wrong, I actually prefer shorter seasons in anime and I was happy to see that we won't be sitting through twenty
                  four episodes of Attack on Titan. Especially if Season 1 is any example, there would most likely be a very tedious air about it all. With a shorter, more compact season, AoT had the opportunity to tell a more impactful story with better animation, presentation, and a tighter narrative. 
Unfortunately, I can't say that it succeeded. Much like the first season, Attack on Titan feels incredibly inconsistent in presentation and narrative. One episode feels like it is totally inconsequential while another feels like everything is moving by at lightning pace. I rather have the pacing be fast, rather than crawling to the finish line like some abnormal titan, but this constant rubber-banding can become tedious. Season 2's shortened length definitely proves beneficial to the short narrative being told. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
[Story, character, and resolution]
There is a distant focus on our protagonist as the writers adapt a more wide scope of characters onto the screen, trying their best to create sympathetic and morally intriguing humans that pepper this sprawling landscape. I very much enjoyed this change, since our protagonists, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin aren't very interesting or charismatic. There's a squeaky blond kid who shouts a lot, the main protagonist Eren, fueled by revenge, who shouts a lot, and Mikasa, who's soft spoken but also totally insipid as a character. They're a complete bore. 
Although the first half of the season really struggled to maintain my interest, I still appreciated them trying to develop a vast array of characters. I will unfortunately say that they don't do this too well. A lot of the episodes focused on certain characters, especially our favorite potato-lover, Sasha, feel totally redundant and misplaced. Her conflict or specific idiosyncrasies don't come off as clear or well-thought out and she gets completely sidelined as the season continues. 
On the other hand, Reiner and Bernholdt get a lot more attention and end up providing much of the shows fast-paced narrative, which is welcome. Although their characters and motivations are left so vague that it often feels stilted, as in, I don't find the way they speak to be realistic of the situation they are in. They purposefully keep things vague which makes it sound like they are hiding from the viewer, rather than the characters. 
The last group of characters that gets the most focus is Christa and Ymir, who are responsible for probably the most compelling, albeit cheesy story of the season. Spurned lovers and the like. Some of their choices made them seem stupider than what the writers may have wanted, however, in the end, at least there was some emotion there. Comparing that to our protagonist and their motivations, that is a major positive. 
...
As the season progresses, there is an obvious escalation happening, and Erin is unfortunately at the center of it. While I will say that the latter half of the season is more entertaining from a popcorn fun perspective, it is also where the show becomes completely off the rails as a story. More on that in later sections. 
There are constant monologues during the fights, which create for tension-less encounters that are often back-ended by meaningless cliffhangers that lead to nothing. Each episode ends on a cliffhanger and each cliffhanger rings less and less true or interesting. It's a crutch that most Shounen action series have. 
Erin is often praised by the characters, however, I never felt as though he should be. He is painted as completely bullheaded, yet that is a positive. In one scene one character monologues to another about how Erin would charge into a fight against five people all stronger than him and risk his life, but that's a good thing, apparently. To me, it just comes off as stupid. It doesn't make me like this already shallow, revenge-driven character more. 
Mikasa is virtually just the girl who's a badass during the inconsequential action scenes and then is reserved to just yelling ""Erin"" really loudly during the parts that yield narrative results. Of course during the climax she gets sidelined because god forbid these characters ever work together. The entire climax felt cheap. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
[Presentation]
I'm getting the boring parts out of the way before I talk about some of the more interesting elements of the series and what comparisons I can draw from it. The presentation here is fine. Much like the rest of the series it is horribly uneven, drifting from impressive animation to some really hokey and pathetic CG filler scenes that pepper most of the series. Every episode we got one or two filler cuts where a bunch of characters ride their horses along a texture wrap, and they're horses look really stiff and lifeless. The entire thing gives me flashbacks to Berserk(2016). It looks awful. 
On the other hand, when WIT decides to put in some time there are some pretty engaging and fun action scenes, albeit poorly choreographed, as most of the time I really didn't understand the distance between objects. Coming off the heels of Kabaneri, I really was hoping for more in terms of animated fidelity here. Kabaneri, the last, and probably equally mediocre series that WIT worked on had significantly more impressive animation, character design, and set pieces, which made Attack on Titan feel like a pale imitation, which is all the more strange since Kabaneri was the actual imitation. 
It was really clear that most of the effort was put into the first episode and the last few, since those are the episodes with the most consistent level of animation. As I said, when WIT decides to put that work in, it looks great. There are plenty of spectacularly designed and perhaps unintentionally hilarious Titans that waddle about on screen, and I maintain the notion that the titans are perhaps one of the coolest baddies I've seen. There are some genuinely fun designs here and those are often backed up by funny animation cycles which makes some of these abnormal creatures more memorable than many of the human characters. 
...
The music is about as solid as ever. The OP is a shadow of season 1's initial opening, but it is still fine. The ED is better, and I appreciate that these openings and ending credits are actually attempting to be relevant, rather than just a super-cut of the characters flying through the air and posing. 
The musical cues are amazing. From the electric guitar riffs to the awesome distorted violins, each one is memorable and never fails to bring your attention back to what is happening on screen. The shift into the orchestral themes of the series are alright, although I can't say they are as engaging.

[Character death and you] 
Oh man, I remember having an argument with someone on reddit about the character deaths in the series. They, for some absurd reason were set on the notion that Attack on Titan was successful due to its characters being in constant threat of dying. He compared it to the likes of Game of Thrones, which I found preposterous since I don't believe Attack on Titan's characters are under any threat whatsoever. 
Game of Thrones has revolutionary narrative structure, visuals, and compelling character motivations, dialogue, and so on. Attack on Titan doesn't really have any of that, but more important, GoT truly excels with keeping you on the edge of your seat with character deaths solely because it lacks a protagonist. There is no ""plot armor"" here because there is no main character. Attack on Titan obviously has main characters which are obviously in no real danger, so that fear is coming from nowhere but from the viewers mind. 
So with this in mind, none of that concept ends up ringing true. Characters in Attack on Titan do die, and I appreciate the length of which the director and animators go to show that death in this show is brutal. But it really doesn't feel as though everyone is at risk. With that being said, the violence here is actually pretty entertaining. I say that with the idea that violence in television and film is inherently entertaining and anime really kind of sucks at violence.
Attack on Titan is far from what I'd call a ""gory"" series, however, it is definitely a few nice steps above what I'd say is a ""regularly bloody anime"". The censorship rules in Japanese television, which are unfortunately in affect for most anime, are really disheartening, since nothing really feels spectacularly gory. All the blood here looks like ketchup and there are no guts or bones or anything like that. All the humans can get dismembered with a spurt of ketchup and that's that. This is surprising to me since Japan is definitely a body-horror oriented audience, with the ""horror"" genre being huge in Manga and some of the greatest horror films in Japan having these elements. 
But that's a problem for another day. Attack on Titan at least tries to shock its audience with the horrors transpiring, and while they aren't really that effective when compared to the likes of, once again Game of Thrones, or even a significantly inferior and somewhat awful series like The Walking Dead. Even through all these unfortunate restrictions I still found myself enjoying some of the more horrific elements in the series, which is definitely a positive since not many anime really impress me in that aspect. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
[Shounen action cliches] 
Inevitably, we have to touch on Shounen action shows and the cliches that come with them. Attack on Titan is undoubtedly a Shounen action series with the target demographic of boys ages thirteen through seventeen. Which is expected, as by definition Shounen is a teenage-oriented show. With that said, Attack on Titan is far from a mature series, despite it's 17+ rating. Sure there is blood and a hint of moral gray, but it really never strays any further than that.
The themes are blunt, the story is clear, and there isn't much depth beyond man-eating titans and the crazy plot-twists that end up coming with that. Which leads me to my next point, and a trope of Shounen action that I call ""escalation"". Where the show starts at one point in terms of situation and narrative, and then as the story progresses it escalates the drama and action to the point of absurdity.
When Attack on Titan started it was a series oriented around survival. Man versus beast, and that was the show at its best. For the first five episodes of the series, I really loved it. However, as it progressed and that escalation started occurring it shifted from survival to flat-out action and became more of a flesh-mecha. That unfortunately cheapened a lot of elements from the show, and I personally just don't find that concept all too interesting. It continued like this and as the season 2 finale shows, it really isn't stopping this escalation. I'm convinced that in a few seasons we'll have the moon reveal itself to be a titan and crash down into the earth as Eren becomes an amalgamation of all the titans to fight it. Or something like that. 
It really could go anywhere, and that escalation unfortunately ruined a lot of potentially good shows. For example, Full Metal Alchemist:Brotherhood became absurd towards the end, breaking any and all verisimilitude and left me disappointed. As the series progresses, AoT feels as though it will begin to do the same. The plot developments are all either really obvious or so hilarious ridiculous that you can't help but laugh at them. Which isn't a big positive for a show that is incredibly devoid of humor through much of its run-time. 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
[Conclusion]
I have a natural bias against superhero programming. I'm going to be honest here. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy some or fully avoid others, it just means that by concept, superhero shows rarely interest me in concept. The idea that some random kid gets insane powers without even trying is lame to me. I much rather see people work to get where they are. Attack on Titan became a superhero show the second Erin got this ridiculous power out of nowhere and now is, as plenty of characters made it clear, the ""last hope of humanity."" It really plays as generic and uninteresting. Even the moral conflicts are all just cliches at this point. 
So with Erin inhabiting this role, I find myself with a blase ideology when watching this series. I have absolutely no interest in this escalation specifically because I know it will escalate. However, Attack on Titan still manages to keep things fresh by throwing some decently engaging fight scenes and some characters that I find myself a little more interested in than our protagonists. Christa and Ymir's story this season was definitely cheesy, but it was a nice kind of cheese, like a fine a ricotta, rather than the stale american that this show often forces down my throat. 
Attack on Titan is a shounen through and through, and that occasionally prevents me from really just enjoying it for its action. It is the little things, here. For example, when a character is in a scary situation with Titans piling on top of them and then another character tries to speak to them, all the titans just kind of stop moving to let them finish talking. These blatant over-sites aren't as innocuous as you may think, since each moment that rips you out of the scene adds up to you not treating this show with any respect or care, making for a fake experience. 
The finale continues to elevate the series' stakes without managing to create a world in which those stakes feel feasible. The twist was obvious, however, the implications of it are yet to be explained and I'm sure they'll need another thirteen episodes of the already announced third season to do so. A lot was supposedly happening this season, and some of it was pretty fun, however, the plethora of honestly disorienting flashbacks and blunt, repetitive dialogue created a lack of interest that continued through the season. This made the entire experience feel grand, yet completely mediocre at the same time. 
Unless it really fumbles, I feel like this is the kind of attitude Attack on Titan will have for its run-time. It is undoubtedly carried by its genuinely creative premise and spectacular monsters, however, it falls short in the narrative and dialogue, making the entire experience palatable, but not something you'd want to eat every day.",5
"
                THE GOOD:
Art--
The art style of the second season is of course the same as the first, however this season delivers a little bit clearer, fresher look. The first season featured heavier lines outlining the characters. However, in this season, each character, as well as the Titans, have much thinner and precise lines. Eren Jaeger's eyes are as beautiful as always.
Music--
While there are no completely new themes that I have heard of, (except for the opening and ending), this season features remixed version of the first season's OST. Many of these remixes are even better than the original versions. 
Characters--
This season takes a deeper look into
                  some of the supporting cast, such as Sasha, Connie, Reiner, Ymir ETC., while still keeping a good focus on the Shiganshina Trio. All of the characters are getting much more screen time and development than in the first season.
Story--
The story is following very close to the Manga so far, (as of Episode 7), which is delivering new mysteries, fight scenes, and of course, death. There are major plot twists coming up. The very first episode leaves you wanting more, and every episode thereafter. 
THE BAD: 
Pacing-- 
The first season had an issue with pacing, making the story go longer than it should have and thus unable to cover as much content as it potentially could have. Unfortunately, the second season delivers similar pacing. Almost every episode features a flashback, some longer than others. Some of these flashbacks occur, like the first season, in the middle of a fight. 
THE UGLY:
The only thing ugly about this season is the fact that there will only be 12 episodes.",10
"
                ~Watched up to episode 10, opinions haven't changed for the most part~
So far season 2 of Attack on Titan has been a very mixed bag.
On the one hand the animation and visual style of the show is very appealing to look at (its been that way since season 1). It manages to diversify the generic anime style just enough to stand out, but not too much that it may look jarring/too stylised, which could turn some people off. 
The world building is very impressive too. Season 1 did a good job of establishing the environment the series takes place in, as well as the way
                  the society within the walls functions. There were also plenty of interesting secrets left unanswered like the basement and the origins of the titans, as well as the purpose of the titan shifters.
Music is another strong point of Attack on Titan. The soundtrack does a very good job of driving in a feeling about what's happening. There could be something epic and grand, sombre and foreboding, or fast-paced and intense. Whatever the situation, the music accompanying it is incredible.
The characters unfortunately are fairly hit and miss. Disappointingly enough the main protagonist Eren is still very one note and predictable. His dead parent backstory is very mundane and generic by anime standards and season 2 isn't much different. While his attitude does a good job of pushing the action forward when it needs to, theres been such little focus on the main survey corps group, who were the main focus of the first season. The constant switching back and forth of the focus between different people means it feels like nothing is ever able to settle on what the current topic is. One second there's heart stopping tension and action keeping you on the edge of your seat and the next you have people spouting exposition from a carriage while everyone else in attendance listens silently.
~Not going to talk about plot details, but I will be mentioning a general opinions of certain episodes/the type of episode (e.g. this episode had lots of action/was slow/was boring). If you want to experience that for yourself then watch them and come back~
The biggest problem from my own and other people's view is the general pacing of the show and how it has been split up into the various episodes. For the most part of episodes 1 and 2, nothing happens. I honestly don't know how else to describe it. There's some development/backstory for side characters which is nice and all, as well as the introduction of something very ominous and mysterious, but no real action is taken. To be fair I have read the manga up to a certain point so I was already aware of some of the twists/reveals, but it should at least be decently entertaining. Even by the time episode 3 rolls around, it waits until the VERY end to ramp up the tension with a threat, only to instantly kill all of that momentum by ending the episode. Put it this way. If you watch this series completely blind, don't get excited when something happens. It's going to get cut off by the end of the episode and you'll have to wait another week to see how it plays out.
Binge watching the entire season once it's finished may fix this issue of pacing but even still I feel the way each episode is divided up based on the content of the manga could have been handled a lot better. It's a cheap and easy way to try and drum up excitement by cutting every intense scene in half between episodes. After a while it becomes more frustrating than anything.
I want to praise this more, I really do. Season 1 showed off a really cool concept with a fleshed out world and kept up the tension very well. At the moment however, I just can't say anything too wild.
I'll probably be coming back to this later on, depending on how the later episodes go. As of episode 6 it seems like things are finally happening and a central antagonist/conflict has been introduced. Hopefully this keeps going full steam until the end.",6
"
                Am gonna keep this short.. 
It has improved on the First season. The story is progressing unpredictably. All characters have a purpose and are given more time on screen. Loving the Music, they outdid themselves. From the OP, the in-show music to the ED very beautiful. Love the way it's consistent with the first season but still has a life of its own. Several epic moments in such a short anime. Cheers to the staff involved. Bring us more quality like this.. Thank you. 
And now I'm forced to continue cause they saying this is a short review. I can continue. 
From Episode 1, the
                  awesomeness just goes on. 
I don't read the manga, am an anime guy. Will have to read it just to see what the source looks like. 
After the 1st season, I was mind-blown. I anticipated such a great 2nd part, but this has exceeded my expectations. 
Hands down best anime of 2017 so far. 
In future people will look back and praise this season for it's use of music.",10
"
                ***Spoiler-free review (as of Episode 6)***
Season1 is by far my favorite anime of all time; as a result, expectations were set extremely high. Second season focuses more on general story and character development, which is why it has slower pacing at least for now. If you can, I would advise to wait until the whole season is out and binge-watch (I can't wait myself). I was hoping there would be a fresh soundtrack, but the remakes of OST from Season1 fit well. Overall, I'd rank this a notch below Season1, but still above almost any other show out there.  Can't wait for next Saturday!

"
                I dont write reviews but this has to be said.
AOT s1 was okay... some mystery a lot of heroism and quite a lot of drama. it was fine. but this season is unbearably bad. the story is shallow and pretty easy to figure out. and whats the anwser to that when the show tries to be ""complex""? A LOT OF RANDOM JUMPS AND CUT. I mean whats the deal here? why cant the story be like this happened first->then this->then this? its like 12 hrs earlier and then after like 5 mins... 12 hrs earlier.. and memories and random mumbo jumbo... please stop.
*Edit*
After watching the
                  rest of the season i gotta say they really made HUGE improvements and honestly imo set up the AoT title to become one of the best anime of all time. Let's see what s3 has in store for us.",7
"
                When Attack on Titan originally aired, the anime community was thrust into disarray as we experienced something that rarely happens: Everyone was watching. The show had managed to permeate the mainstream, and the hype was nearly immeasurable. Four years later, it's safe to say its sequel isn't garnering nearly as much attention. Thus it may come as a surprise to hear that AoT season 2 addresses nearly all of the flaws of the first season, and in only half the length of its predecessor, managed to entirely outdo itself. 
The season starts out with a fundamental shift in tone from what we had become accustomed
                  to. Instead of the high octane, action packed nature of the show which had become its primary driving force, season 2 sets the stage by introducing a mysterious new threat into the fray. In addition, it reinstates the primal threat of the titans that the first season started to lose sight of. Titans are terrifying creatures, beasts that indiscriminately dismember and devour humans; it's important that the viewer fears them as well, or else what we're watching is oddly deformed giant humanoids flailing about the walls. Thankfully, It accomplishes this through its delivery of one of the most gruesomely horrific opening scenes I've seen in Attack on Titan's history. And after that, it doesn't shy away from that instilled fear, or back off to give us a break. 
As I alluded to, this season slows down a lot. But, it's better off for it. AoT S2 explores and expands upon its more mysterious and somewhat overlooked cast of characters, unraveling their underlying motivations, vulnerabilities, desires, conflicts, and secrets in intimate detail. In half the length, S2 manages to develop its cast much more impressively than its prequel. The first season had some issues with balancing high-paced action with substance. These problems have been rectified. Moreover, it capitalizes on this fine writing by granting the characters the opportunity to make significant decisions that affect the plot. Needless to say, the various revelations and developments that occur within this season would not have had nearly the same weight had the characters remained underdeveloped. 
As far as the story goes, I was pleasantly surprised by its compactness. In my less optimistic moments, I expected the short 12 episode season to be marred by a rushed, incoherent, plot-hole filled mess of a plot. However, the slower-paced and  more grounded approach of this season played to the advantages of its single cour run. It is unrealistic to expect real ""closure"" as there is too much left in the story to be told, so the key takeaway for me was seeing how season 2 could wrap all the ideas it presented into 12 episodes in a satisfactory way. I have to commend the studio for this point. You don't get this level of refinement without a hell of a lot of prep work.
One of the most impressive aspects of AoT, for me, is how well crafted the scenes typically are. Sometimes a specific anime, for whatever reason, brings out the absolute best a studio can deliver. We saw it happen with Shaft and the Monogatari series. The same thing seems to be happening here. And season 2 somehow manages to raise the bar on this point as well. As a frame of reference, one scene in particular simply has a group of people riding on the backs of slowly moving horses at night. Initial interpretations of this synopsis would probably read as follows: ""Boring."" Yet my hands were sweating as I watched. The show seems to be able to craft scenes that hit all of the right notes in all of the right spots, and I believe this largely comes down to the studio's intense passion for this series and a keen attention to detail. Even the most subtle of cues, such as the precise moment of when to play a specific track in the background, or none at all, is not overlooked. As such, it comes as no surprise that AoT S2 presents one of the most beautifully sculpted fight scenes I've had the pleasure of watching (upon viewing I trust you'll be able to tell which scene this is).
Attack on Titan was special. It amassed a level of popularity that transcended it atop all other competition in its medium. After four years, I had forgotten much about it. Attack on Titan season 2 reminded me of its quality, and taught me that it is indeed more special than I originally surmised.",10
"
                Contains spoilers from Season 1 and Season 2
Pls send feedback if you have any
So after four years of waiting, we finally get our Season 2 for Attack on Titan. Whoopee Yahoo, we've been waiting for so long for this. Now was it worth the wait? ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
We start the season right after Annie Leonhart is captured and frozen in her Titan crystal, and we see all the rookie scouts sitting in a base away from the cities and towns. After that things get pretty nuts. New Beast Titan, another wall supposedly broken, and people dying left and right. Classic AoT, bringing back everything we loved about
                  it. Now, this is where it start to go downhill, as we soon get hit with various plot twists and drama. Here's the issue. Overexaggeration of situations. It's hard to be invested in anything when it just starts to get too ridiculous. Throwing whatever you can into your anime worked for Keijo, but for something that's supposed to be serious and dark, it just doesn't fit in. All the plot twists are obvious but they still try to make it a massive revealment, and the drama's impact is lessened with annoying dialogue that makes it more amusing the more it tries to be intense.
The action and deaths are still great though. Scouts flying around ripping apart Titan napes, Titan flailing about munching on scouts, and a bunch of new Titan shifters going ham on each other. Each and every scene of this bloodfest is such a joy to watch, as the animation is superb when it comes to depicting the ferocity of the whole ordeal. Although every once in a while we get some annoying dialogue or flashback interrupting the action and ruining the flow of the scenes, and the CGI Colossal Titan does need a little getting used to, it's all well and good as AoT does what AoT does best.
Some of the supporting cast get some limelight as well, but it still neglects a lot of the rest and leaves them in the background. We get a few new titan shifters, some characters get some backstory of them, and a few meet their family and some other people from their hometown. (Although I don't think Conny was too happy about it) It's all nice and all to see the supporting cast pushed forward, but then we get others that are pushed back to make room. It's just so unbalanced with the way it wants to portray their cast, swapping them back and forth frantically trying to keep them all relevant as we start to lose more and more interest.
Now, the thing that irks me the most is the unanswered questions. Annie? Still in the Titan crystal. Secrets of the walls? Barely touched on. Basement? What's that? In fact, instead of answering all our various thoughts on AoT, it provides us with even more questions to ponder. Who or what is the Beast Titan? What's the dark past of Historia? What are the goals of the new Titan shifters? What happened to that one village? Sure it answers some stuff, but we're left with so many untouched plot points that it gets frustrating to continuously catch up to each ep.
Attack on Titan was a slight disappointment. I was hoping to get what I wanted from the series, but the 12 eps decided I should wait for next year cause fuck me. If you're a massive fan of AoT, go ahead, watch it to your heart's content. For anyone else, I would proceed with caution as this show is just a mix of exciting action and lacklustre story and characters.",6

- Reiner
-Seeing the Death of comrades leads them to astray as making himself fall as soldier or neither as a warrior. Reiner is actually one of the most interesting characters to me due to the way he involuntarily switches between soldier and warrior when he can't bear the weight of his sins… But with his arm, the steam itself might've given it up, but maybe he could've hidden it.

"
                A lot of times when people try to persuade someone to watch/read series the first thing we tend to do is cover up or separate our bias towards the series. Obviously if you're a fanboy or a hater, your opinion towards a series will lose some credibility. With that being said I will not hide the fact that I love Attack on Titan and consider myself a big fan of the series, so whether your take my review on the show serious or not is absolutely your choice, as I attempt to convince you that the second season of Shingeki no Kyojin is phenomenal. 
I'm
                  a manga reader of this series, and if you haven't read the manga, minor spoiler alert; the art is at times very average. There were times in the manga where it was hard to tell what character was being drawn, which Isayama has gotten better with as of late, so when I seethe anime counterpart I'm astonished as to how great the anime looks compared to the manga. Even compared to other top notch animated series Attack on Titan is one of the best, and I have to say Wit Studio is doing a hell of a job.
On to the sound, I'm usually never paying attention to the background music when it come to short running shows, but this time the music captured me/ A beautiful soundtrack would be paired with an epic moment, and make that moment even more memorable. The opening is also one of the favorites and every time I hear it I find myself screaming SASAGEYO!!!!!
Now as for the characters, I will admit that this was a weak point in this season since he didn't get much character development for our main cast of characters. The focus of characterization went to other characters that were not at all focused on in the first season, so the people might say ""uh who the hell are these guys"" when the see them being the topic of the episode.
Another aspect of this show that made season 1 great was the mystery, and in season 2 we get answers to some question we might have had, while it still builds on even more mystery. The show does a great job of giving you clues and answers without giving you all the puzzle pieces to keep you guessing.
All in all, regardless if I considered a fanboy you giving this show a 10, I care very little for. It truly was a fantastic sophomore season and I'll be awaiting another great season, so I hope I can convince some people to start watching, it's worth your time.",10
"
                ""Sasageyo! Sasageyo! Shinzou wo sasageyo!""
(""Dedicate, oh, dedicate! For this cause, your heart you must dedicate!"")
You are in a world where Titans, giant humanlike creatures that prey upon humans continue to exist, driving humanity to the brink of extinction. You only have one choice: to fight. You now already have some kind of advantage: A Titan enraged against other Titans, a soldier whom Titans have no chance winning against, hope of territory reclaiming and a very beautiful woman named Krista (the latter seems to be a joke). Will you still be satisfied and keep on living life like caged animals? Or you continue to fight? Fighting
                  for your freedom you long hope? (Even though there's a large chance you got killed by the Female Titan.)
And thus continues the events in Shingeki no Kyojin (Again, I won't be using Attack on Titan because Shingeki no Kyojin doesn't translate to this) in its second season.
Again, I wonder: Is the story any good? Or is it better than the first season? Maybe even worse? Maybe so horrible you wouldn't want to watch it? I wouldn't know.
In order to fully enjoy Shingeki no Kyojin, I waited for the second season to be completed and watched it along the first season. I completed it in six days because it was so good.
The story still centers around Eren Jaeger, a kid who've joined the Survey Corps with his best friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert, along with the remaining Top 10 members of the 104th Cadet Training Squad: Jean, Ymir, Krista, Connie, Reiner, Bertolt, etc.. He also has the ability to turn into a Titan with the capacity of intelligence and immense strength, shown when he plugged up the wall in Trost District.
As usual, being a second season, new characters and new revelations surround it. Many shocking things happened while at the the same time, unforgettable and awesome. Many of the battle scenes were well-played by the characters along with the deaths I didn't want to happen. Why!? Why should the characters who are supposed to be omega-strong died? Maybe because it's natural for they have a race far superior to them, preying them? That oppresion must not prevail! At least that's my opinion.
Again, the art was so great that I can't get over it. The battle scenes that portray humans defending against Titans with their lives was again so spectacular that, again, I can't get over it. Especially the Levi scenes on the first season, which were very well-drawn. A mere 24-minute episode got extended to about 35 minutes because of constant rewinding. After all, who wouldn't like someone killing monstrous giants with blades shaped like cutter blades while simultaneously balancing on two detractable ropes with gas fuel? I want it too.
The character designs was to die for, even more highlighting than the first season. The character designs for Eren and the other seems to have remained as it is, but in my perspective...is it me or Mikasa and Krista's designs were far too improved I finally lost my wits? Am I too biased? I hope not. MIKASA AND KRISTA FOR LIFE! AGAIN!
The OSTs and music was also beautiful. What really piqued my attention was the opening, which didn't have German lyrics, but really bedazzled me on its bridge. Care to read some?

I really can't get over it. Once again, I commend the ways and styles of Nippon's music industry in making music to be used in anime. Too great to be hated. At least to me.
Characters.
The human poulation is in decline because of the Titans. More than two hundred thousand died trying to recapture Wall Maria, even though I think that that plan was kind of a cover up, for the government is trying to suppress human population due to depleting resources. Such unfairness. Nevertheless, I really liked the characters, main, side and the members of the Survey Corps. Need I say more?
The overall enjoyment I experienced watching Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2 is a bit low compared to the first season, but still high, even though it has a cliffhanger at the end and raised many to ask many questions. Why is that? I don't know.
Overall, this anime is to be commended for its complex storyline, great art, music, battle scenes and characters, but not forgetting the meaning it holds within. At least there's one. Kudos.
Watch the second season. It'll be worth your time.
Now I'll be waiting for the third season.",9

                The series continues to be colossal. Bummer of whom the critic in a disorderly way. Even with the ""budget down,"" it's still way above average. The quality, the fluency, the action scenes, especially ... They are still very good.
The concept of the anime follows well, and the execution, which was criticized last season, saw a slight improvement over its predecessor.
My only caveat, continues to be the personal development of some characters. I think it would very willingly have an emotional load well embedded in characters like the protagonist himself, so that we can follow him, step by step, the unfolding.

                I noticed that most people who don't like this series are shounen fanboys that typically want a two-dimensional badass like Goku in constant battle with someone. And the ones who underestimate is had the attention span of a 3-year-old. 
Like I said in my review of Season 1: Eren Jeager is a phenomenal character. For once the main character in anime is not an annoying Gary Stu! Flawed, emotional, passionate, driven, brave and with bouts of madness that stem from his PTSD (something rarely shown in anime after a character goes through something horrific), he is far more complex and human than anything I've seen
                  from Japan so far. I'm impressed.
Season 1 had a great complex storytelling but it was the outer layer of the onion which amounted to mostly introducing the plot. The soldier who has an enemy and joins the military to destroy them yet underneath all that Season 1 had foreshadowing and subtle hints (that many didn't get, unfortunately) that told the viewer, there is more than what appears.
Season 2 did a wonderful job, starting with the smooth, fluid peeling of that first layer at a balanced paced. Well focused on its subject. Thoughtfully placed foreshadowing and little hints of revelations - such as a glimpse of a past society within the walls and the sort of politics that played within them that have clear repercussions in the present. It sheds some light on some of the side stories as well, particularly Ymir's. (I highly recommend watching those)
The world building is done fluidly. The killings always had a purpose and anyone with half a brain would have seen that and even realized a few answers to some questions posed in Season 1 had they the ability to recognize the hints and foreshadowing. Season 2 has revealed something I've realized since Season 1. There seems to be an unseen war fought between the governments inside the walls and whoever orchestrated the attack on Wall Maria. I even have my own suspicions as who it is and why.
I cannot wait to see more.",10

                WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAIN SPOILERS
Well, following my previous review, it's time to make the analysis of the plot holes and other retarded aspects that this season had. So let's go:
1. Kidnapping: At this point, more titan users are revealed. Why didn't these users show their powers or some anticipation about that in the previous season? No fucking idea. The funniest part is that they revealed this detail by themselves, so what was the point of hide this fact? The writer justified this with a double personality of the traitors. This was a fucking nonsense. Also, it seemed that the kidnapped group had super sharpened sense.
                  In other words, it is as if they have read the script in advance and know what is going on in the surroundings. How is this possible? Mystery. In addition, the titans had the ability to regenerate, and wait, this concept gonna get worse with certain character that I'm gonna mention later.
2.Flashbacks: Why did the writer put this flashbacks, most of the times, in the middle of the fights? I don't know. It's too anticlimatic. The worst part is that this show, or at least I think, that it had the objective of shock the audience and making things like that is really contradictory. Why they put flashbacks inside the flashbacks? No fucking idea. But it was really fun.
3. Erwin's horse: How it's possible that this little horse was more fast that the titans? I don't know. This challenges the physical laws and logic established in the previous season.
4. Eren being a titan: By far, the worst plot hole of this season. This one alone created several additional plot holes. In my previous review, I've mentioned that were innecesaries deaths during the Levi's Squad appearance. If Eren would have turned into a Titan in that moment, no one would have died, so why didn't do that? I don't know, because according to the established rules of the transformation into a titan, the user needs to be fully regenerated in order to do the transformation and Eren was at his 100% all this time, even in the moment that he made the transformation the first time in the show, it wasn't like some part of his body appeared magically and with that he was just able to make the transformation since that moment. Many people can justify this by saying that Eren was a rookie in the transformation, however the tension and context with the squad was similar, so why here and not in the previous season? Additionally, in the next season, there will be another plot hole that 100% confirmes this one. Also, Eren had the ability to control other titans. Despite that the reason of this was explained in the next season, what prevented them from explaining it in this one? Mystery. It's like the author invented this power up outta nowhere and, later, he had the idea of how justify this when the hype about it have already ended. Talking to the transformation scene, how is it possible that the titan's drastic juices didn't do the least damage to Eren? No fucking idea. How it's possible that Eren, in his human form, was able to open a titan's mouth? I don't know. Another funny aspect was the training before this moment. What was the point to create these strategies if, at the end, the power ups would make the job? Mystery. The writer was able to skip that training and go through the transformation of Eren. 
5. Main characters forces: Like the case of Eren, why only him, Mikasa and Levi can defeat other titans without problems? What make them more special than the other characters? Mystery. This trope is classic in other shonen, however, in this one, the author does not even try to justify this and, if he does, it is when this fact no longer has any importance in the plot.
6. The ending: Why didn't the Colossal and/or the Armored appear to stop Eren to put the rock in the wall? I don't know. What a coincidence that the stone was right there so that they can put it on the wall and it is also pure concidience that the stone is just the appropriate size to be able to close the wall. It's crazy how convenient this whole part was.
And that's it for this season. And it's going to get better with more retarded plot holes, more revelations, and more anticlimactic moments. See you in the next season.",4

                Attack On Titan Season 2 deserves an outstanding score of 10/10 and many other people believe so as well.

"
                Other than the male x male shipping, I am not finding many reasons to like this show anymore.
Half of the season is practically a collection of cliche action scenes. People teleport from the sky to save the day, others swing in the sky with spider-man gears, evil people sit on the face of someone just to prove that they indeed evil, Levi declares he is an insane badass by committing an act that distantly resembles the twisting of an arm. So fucked up! I am scared, literally how can man be this insane. Please, no, not the arm.
The other half is practically a parody of
                  politics except the narrative itself doesn't recognize this lameness as a parody. People with might and power declare a thing, but another thing happens -- much like with the teleporting nakama in the action side -- other big guys teleport whenever important decisions are supposed to be made. Essentially every part of the politics is so one-dimensional it hurts and serves as an excuse to create more bullshit to fill the story with. These vary from random kidnapping incidents to people thinking one of their nakama dies if they don't hurry up. I am not sure how exactly am I supposed to be fooled by this when it is clear plot-armors in the series are thicker than the walls itself.
The best part of this show are the supposedly evil people and ""our"" enemies. Whenever our main squad gets called subhumen or pseudo-soldiers by them, I agree whole-heartedly. The opposing party did nothing wrong when looking down on our plebeian children at arms. Which this show really is all about. Some kids acting like they matter, fighting against titans or being titans or hiding from titans behind walls made of titans. At least the first season was fun to watch because it was a complete disaster and so overboard idiotic. This isn't even ironically fun anymore. More meaningless events one after another.
This season doesn't achieve anything. It's just Eren being chained half the time + farming, characters pondering over some action for half an episode each episode just to see the thing itself never happening. It's all false tension, all words no reward, no payout. Boring substance that is repetition of the same over and over while the fallacy that something might actually happen being there to fool those who are still buying this. Oh no, titan appears for the 700th millionth time, what a shock, I wonder which one of the two things that ever happen when a titan appear, happens this time around. Literally can't wait for the next cour.",2
"
                The attack on Titans is probably the one of the most famous anime in the history of Anime, the popularity of it cannot be underestimated and just like the Shonen of the old days, attack on Titans provided multiple people a get way into anime, it is a go to anime for many newbies. And with the end of the second season, it is time to reevaluate this anime.
Note: This post may have some spoilers, reader’s discretion is advised.
As a typical Shonen, attack on Titans follows the path of a hero trying to save the whole world with his friends. And unlike a typical Shonen
                  attack on Titans uses a reality-based approach to its storytelling, at least until plot demands some Miracle. However, this approach to storytelling is not new to Shonen anime, but it is more refined and mature in the attack on titans than any other shounen anime, well except for hunter x hunter. The Attack on Titan uses the gore and its environment as a tension building equipment, giving the viewer both excitement and suspense at the same time. However, this storytelling method has some shortcomings, it is mainly due to Eren surviving a deadly situation with some stupid super powers and did I tell you that he can now also control Titans, It is so OP that it would put even Madara to shame. This not only breaks the belief of an unforgiving world but also reduces the tension which was build up to this point in the series, with any sense of danger for our heroes gone. This was truly a turning point for the series, as it transitioned from a unique shounen anime to a typical shounen anime where main characters have the power of plot armor and they cannot die. By my view, the story could have continued where Eren’s friends could have continued the fight and rather than using the muscle of Titans they could have used the muscle of their brains at least for once, but no matter it is what it is. This part did not reduce the enjoyment of the series as much as it reduced its uniqueness in my eyes.
Characters in Attack on Titans are quite supportive and rigid, they are there to support the hero, in this case, Eren. It is like that they do not have any personalities but their personalities are lines of supporting Eren in every circumstance. Most of the time it is understandable, but seeing as every character has these characteristics, make those characters bland and boring. It seems like the whole world revolves around Eren which is normally not a bad thing but seeing people supporting him without any consideration of his nature makes me question the logicality of nearly every character in Attack on Titans. As for Eren, he is very typical Shonen Hero, dedicated to his friends, comrades, and to the cause, which he thinks is just but as usual unable to see the bigger picture. After watching so many Shonen anime, at least for me these characteristics of the Hero has become annoying and Eren is no exception to that. Nearly every character well except for potato girl seems bland and nonunique, no characters are genre breaking and lovable at least for me, maybe it is because I watched too much Shonen anime in past which makes me sick of these stereotypes. But for anyone who is new to anime, these characters might be gold. However as Attack on Titans is not a character-centric show these flaws doesn’t affect it as much as it will any other anime.
Well choreographed action and thrill are what makes Attack on Titan good. It is very hard to find a well-choreographed Shonen show as Attack on Titans and mixing it with unique concepts or at least art style and Titan(kind of like Zombies) will put most of the thriller anime to Shame. Fluid actions and unique art style make Attack on Titan very enjoyable show to watch, Attack on Titans may be lackluster in other departments but it is very strong where it should be and that what makes it special. The attack on Titans stays constantly active, moving like a river never giving you chance to be bored, it is attention grabbing and it is very powerful in its visual aspects.
Now let’s talk about the second season a bit, every problem in the first season was transferred to the second season and every strength in the first season was removed from the second season. The first season fails to explain many things and it ended in mystery, the second season tries to alleviate that problem but it fails to do so. The second season is nothing but a massive badly done plot dump and nothing more. The second season also tries to invest in its empty characters, however, there is literally no connection between viewers and characters, there is no reason for you to feel emphatic towards them. I can understand why Mikasa is so obsessed with Eren because of flashback which was given to us, but I can’t understand why in the hell Ymir is so obsessed with Krista. Their character motivation is a just mess, without understanding the past I can’t connect and can’t feel sympathy for either of them. Problems with the second season don’t stop there, while whole season feels like a huge plot dump and boring one at that, they had given 12 episode for explaining the world of Attack on Titan and they couldn’t even manage to do that. It is ridiculous that they had 12 episodes to explain everything and at the end of the series you only manage to answer one question that humans are Titans and which was quite obvious from the start of the series, because what would they be? if not glorified Zombies. Which takes me to the next point.
The concept of Attack on Titans may that be the world, the Titans, 3d maneuver gear, unique art style, fluid fights and detail that they put into every scene is incredible at least in the first season, there is so much potential to be had in the concept of Attack on Titans and not to mention its high budget and truly all these things outmaneuver all these flaws exceptionally, yet I feel that so much potential has been lost in this series and especially in the second season where both action and visuals feel bland. There is not a good amount of thrill like the first season, nither there is incredible detail in the second season and there are no memorable character movements like the in the first season. The attack on Titans just like Sword Art Online took off based on its visuals, action, and concept and this just further proves again how powerful a concept can be to make a anime feel good even when its execution was rubbish.
In the end, Attack on Titans is an average Shonen anime. However, Attack on Titans was able to distinguish itself from your run of the mill Shonen anime with its great visuals, concept, art styles, an unending thrill. In my opinion, it could have been much better if it was able to address these issues which I stated in this post. For me, Attack on Titans is nothing but a Titan in the chain.",4
"
                I am writing this for the people who are thinking about watching the anime, but aren't sure. I will not include spoilers in my review.
Attack on Titan Season 2 is a fast-paced, action-packed, plot-twist-filled 12 episodes. It became incredibly popular the instant season 1 started airing, and the fanbase managed to remain active during its hiatus. And the fandom revived during this season, and for a good reason.
The story takes a step up from last season. It's much more unpredictable. It's much more mysterious. Hell, it can even be scary at times. There's always something going on in this anime, and always another mindblowing plot
                  twist to keep you interested. The reveals are insane. The fights are glorious. And the last two episodes are damn near perfect after being built up to during the other 10 episodes. 
The mystery is the main point of the first half, and the second half focuses on action and reveals. My only complaints regarding the story is this season feels messy at times, as that's the downside of being unpredictable, and not enough answers are given to satisfy you with all of the mysteries that are given.
The art is almost as good as the first season. Still movie-worthy. It's just so pleasing to look at. There are the occasional hiccups, and the use of CGI brings it down a considerable amount, but it's for brief sequences so usually you don't notice it (except for a certain moment in episode 7...) Other than that, I love the art, it really brings the manga to life.
Sound gets a perfect 10. They somehow outdid the first season's OST with awesome tracks like Barricades, APETITAN, and ERENtheCOORDINATE. The sound effects are great as well; the ODM gear sound is simply so satisfying. The music complements every single moment, from heartbreaking, to intense, to HYPE. No complaints here.
The characters have a massive improvement this season. Is it the best? No. But it's a step in the right direction. See, they finally give the side character much-needed development, and you actually care about them, for once. Intriguing backstories are made. Character relationships form. The main trio get development, too, though in the later half. This is still the series' biggest flaw, but it's much better than how it was in season 1. Even a flat character like Mikasa becomes very interesting near the end.
Enjoyment is its best aspect. It's just so goddamn hype. The music, art, and amazing plot make for a hell of an experience. All of the intense moments are so masterfully done and it makes up for the character problems I spoke of above. You'll constantly be on the edge of your seat. You'll cry when a character you liked dies. You'll laugh when one of the side characters make a stupid joke with the other characters, despite their bad situation. And you'll be filled with excitement when a hype moment comes along. It's the entire package.
Overall, it's a popular anime with some visible flaws, but with much more pros than cons. People hate on this anime because it's overhyped. It may be overhyped but it's not bad at ALL. It's amazing. I give it a 9.",9
"
                the story is let's explore the side characters and their backstories. it feels like they felt that the fans are starting to forget about them and they want to get them talking again so they have us this. they do continue the story but the meat of it all is character development. I don't want to spoil anything so that's what I'm going to leave you with.
the art is as good as ever the titans are goofy but at the same time scary which it kinda hard to combine. fluid camera cuts and fast-paced action leaving you wanting more.
the opening theme isn't as good as
                  the first season and isn't as nearly has memeable. that's all you wanted to know right, but really its great and fits the scenes perfectly.
like I said earlier all this is is character development. they are adding to the side characters so if the characters weren't good someone didn't do their job right. learning about the characters isn't something you thought you wanted but you really do. where are they from, what happened to their families, how have they grown from where we left off, and etc. and we still have the continued story from where we left off but we haven't gotten to the basement.
Going in i wasn't expecting much because i hated season one and only finished and started watching season 2 because its popular but it really redeemed itself for me. they opened up the world more and added to the side characters they stop on fan theories and add more to others i love it.
so far i give in a 10/10 vs my 1 for the first season i really didn't care for the story and main characters (they're motivations outside of we want our freedom and revenge sucked ( i know that should be enough but it wasnt for me)) but they really fixed that this season.",10
"
                By seeing the rating I’ve gave this show with such praise beyond the anime community, I’m sure many must think I’m just another “mainstream anime hater”. I assure you that I have a good reason for giving this show the rating of 3.
First of all, I’m going to be talking about the series as a whole (from season 1-3 part 1(ep 1)) because though I’ve only seen one ep of this season, i still want to cover this anime. 
Let’s begin, I’ve seen so many people say that this anime is great and that it really has nothing wrong with it but I honestly hate
                  this anime. When watching it,  I couldn’t even bare to watch it, I was getting distracted because I found it extremely boring. Weird,huh? An anime with such heavy action and I find it boring? I honestly think that there’s way tooo much action, that when it come to the dialogue or just scenes where they’re not fighting titans or people aren’t dying, I get extremely bored and just get distracted. Which I completely hate since then I won’t be able to know what’s going on in the anime. Long story short, this anime has a horrible time trying to balance action and dialogue.
Also, the characters are nothing special. We have a guy who yells, a “badass”, another “badass female”, a shy dude.. you basically see my point by now, the characters are something you can see in every.single.anime. At this point it’s getting annoying. Especially since yet again, they’re so highly praised.
Alright, I’m gonna end my review here.. I understand if you love/like this anime, that’s completely fine. Just wanted to say my opinion, hopefully no ones butthurt but yeah- have a nice day
P.S. sorry if any of my spelling, grammar or anything else is horrible. I’m not used to writing reviews and I’m improving on that fact. Hopefully you understand
P.P.S. This review was initially going to be for season 3 part 1 but I was   critiquing it based on one episode, which I found wasn’t fair.
My review: 3/10",3
"
                It’s really damn hard to screw up a show like Shingeki no Kyojin. But its even harder to make it better. 
Season 1 was the legendary show that sent the industry (and fans) up in total surprise. It mastered the story - tying in slivers of hope into a sea of grim fear. It mastered the art - creating both fantastic action scenes and horrid massacres of innocent civilians. It mastered the characters - ingraining deep-seated philosophical in the hearts of fans eager to see what the heroes (and villains) would do next. And, despite all the horror, it bounded a sense of ‘enjoyment’ and
                  emotional struggle that is impactful. 
Season 2 was not meant to have the same effect - because no producer can replicate the sensation from Season 1. Instead, Season 2 simply builds off of the intense desire for more Shingeki no Kyojin. 
The more the story thickens, the more you realize you don’t have a fucking clue as to what’s going on. As Season 1 ended with plenty of unanswered questions, Season 2 begins to answer those questions with more damn questions. For example, one of the dominating questions is where do Titans come from. We think Conny’s revelation with seeing his mother as a titan and watching Ymir’s story helps us understand something … and then “BOOM” - we are lead on about the Church, a potential titan civilianization, more transforming titans, etc. 
Now, don’t get me wrong. This incredibly dynamic story isn’t a bad thing. In fact, it’s actually amazing. The only flaw (of sorts) that I would like to point out is that it will not have the same effect as Season 1 did for so many fans. Season 2 takes the existing story and just wreaks havoc in the best way possible. But that just makes it so incredible to watch. I will say this though - by the end of Season 3, I could tell where the story will probably be going next. And I just can’t wait. 
I do not want to critique this anime too much because that is not my intention. Just know that it still carries over many of the amazing aspects from Season 1.
If you enjoyed Season 1, then I'm sure you'll devour anything that comes out of the Shingeki no Kyojin franchise. Season 2 satisfies that itch.",8
"
                Depending on the context, season 2, can easily be a 10/10 anime. Instead I choose to give it 9.5 (or 9 for this review). Initially, I was not satisfied with this season, compared to the first one. And so I treated it as a 9/10, rather than a 10/10.
But if you watch this after having watched season 3, a lot of things make sense in this season and because of this, the story becomes so much more enjoyable, as you can find all of the clues that were laid for you to guess the twists and turns of the future seasons.
Story 9/10: The story changes
                  its focus quite drastically (for good reason, so don't worry). The main characters of the first season do not appear as much on screen. When watching for the first time, this is kind of a bummer. The story becomes 10/10 on a rewatch.
Art 10/10: Just as good (maybe even better) as last time.
Sound 10/10: Just as good (maybe even better) as last time.
Character 10/10: A LOT of character development for the secondary characters, this makes the entire cast of the show so much more interesting.
Enjoyment 9/10: It's a bit slow at the start, but then it becomes really enjoyable as the story progresses.
Overall 9/10: I give this a 9.5/10, I recommend the entire series to everyone.",9
"
                Much shorter and less epic than the first season, Attack on Titan Season 2 has the single best and most epic moment in the series up to this point but is otherwise worse than its predecessor in almost every way.
Art-
The production values, quality animation and effects present in the first season are still here. Nothing has changed or gotten worse in that regard. The problem lies elsewhere...
Sound-
The voice acting hasn't changed for any of the main characters and it didn't need to, as it was quite good to begin with. I absolutely hate the voice of an important new character introduced in the first episode
                  of this season. Otherwise, high production values etc etc and the overall quality is fine.
The soundtrack is a letdown. I don't feel there is a single track that truly stands out to me that is unique to this season. Even in the most epic moment of the show they merely remix and essentially reuse an already established song from the previous season. Perhaps the fact that there are only 12 episodes and therefore fewer opportunities for epic moments in need of epic songs contributes to this, but overall I can't help but feel disappointed by the soundtrack this time around.
Character-
The characters and story aren't the problem per say, but overall this anime feels very rushed out the door (even though it took years to come out, so it clearly was not...). Cutting down from 25 episodes to just 12 was absolutely a mistake. I understand the behind the scenes reasons why this decision was made, but it still really hurts the show overall.
There are hardly any truly exciting or standout moments of this season and for such a short season it has way too much filler. There is one episode, and I am not kidding or exaggerating, where the ENTIRE EPISODE is spent having a conversation in a tree. Likewise, they spent too much time dipping into the background of an only kinda sorta important character and during that sequence it felt like a whole lot of nothing occurred.
The one saving grace is that the single biggest reveal and most epic moment in the series occurs in this season, but it happens midway through as opposed to at the end, making what was supposed to be a tragic moment at the end feel like not a particularly big deal, and they even screwed up the animation in this epic reveal scene as a character has a forearm in one shot and does not have said forearm in the next. It's just sloppy and like I said it really feels rushed and understaffed.
Enjoyment-
It's Attack on Titan, and I'm a huge Attack on Titan fan, so I enjoyed it, but I definitely, without question enjoyed it less than the first season and I'm definitely disappointed that this is what I got after waiting for years for this to come out. I'm thinking, and hoping, this season will be the low point of the series when all is said and done.
Overall-
Meh...
+THE single most epic moment/reveal occurs, and it's awesome
+High production values
+Continues to develop the story and characters you cared about from Season 1
-Somehow, manages to feel super rushed in some sections and super slow/boring/too much filler in others
-Only 12 episodes as opposed to 25
-Less action/excitement/things you care about compared to Season 1
OBJECTIVE RATING- 7
PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 7",7

                So, here we are 4 years after the phenomenon that was Shingeki no Kyojin Season 1 with 12 episodes of Season 2 to boot. Now, many will complain about the fact that the second season only has 12 episodes; however with the shortage of animators in Japan and Season 3 being announced for 2018, I think it's fair to forgive WIT studio.
First, let me talk about my reaction to episode 1: It was honestly great to see the return of SnK and the first episode cut to the chase with a less than 2 minute recap of season 1 before continuing where season 1 left
                  off. In this episode, the mystery of the wall titan was acknowledged, we got a scene with the beast titan and were reminded of how threatening the titans really were with a brutal death scene.
I honestly love season 2's opening. Much like everyone, I went from thinking:
Episode 1: Eh, it's alright
Episode 2: It's growing on me
Episode 3: SASAGEYO! SASA-*ahem* (serious face)
I'd rank this op as my second favourite since it cannot truly beat JAEGER!!!
Now, without getting into spoilers, I really love how this season focused quite a lot on side characters such as Ymir, Christa, Reiner, Bertholdt etc. and didn't focus too much on Eren; even though I personally never hated Eren as a character that much.
The sound and art style was as great as the first season and many titans didn't look or animate as silly as in season 1 (with the exception of a certain big-faced titan accompanying the beast titan)
Overall, I enjoyed season 2 and look forward to season 3 in 2018. It's nowhere near as focused on action as Season 1 but I really enjoyed the mystery element behind Season 2, and we did get our fair share of action with one of the best fight scenes (without spoiling which one it is) that the franchise has offered thus far.
So, the answer is ""Yes, you should watch Season 2""",9
"
                Every time I watch an episode of this series I cant look away. I get to captivated by the show and loose myself in it. I basically block out any surrounding noise and focus on the one episode I'm watching. this is the reason I give this show a ten. It is just a great show with so many surprising twist and gets your blood boiling. If you love action packed captivating violence with raw power I recommend this show to you. Have a wonderful time sitting at your screen for the next six hours or so watching this masterpiece of a show.

                First of all, I want to apologize for my English.
The first season of attack on titans got me hooked. And I was thinking, they couldn't make it better then the first season, If got it wrong.
Season 2 is really and I mean really epic. The story about surviving and titans is well made. You will get a little bit closer to the titans world. And what the meaning is of the titans.
Story 8: its not the best story and got me confussed sometimes. But still a great story to follow. And to be honest, some parts could be get some more explanation. Like why the
                  guy of Bertold and Reiner got eaten.
Animation 9: One of the best animations in the anime world for me. How the titans are walking. How they pick up those poor people snd eat it in an gruwal way. Just great animation work.
Sound 9: If it is about the opening and ending. I like the opening song. Its really catchy and I listen it sometimes at youtube. The ending is fine not great just fine.
Characters 10: I like alot of the characters in this serie. They all have there charms and i dividual they are great in there own way. I didn't get anoyed by them. Even the beast titan is great.
Enjoyment 9: One of the best season for me now. (Need to watch season 3). There is so much action in this serie. And still one of the best series of anime to watch. Should I rewatch it with y friends? The answer is YES!!!",9
"
                4 years later, the juggernaut returns. The anomaly that is Attack on Titan premiered in anime form 2013 to worldwide acclaim. It saw a meteoric rise to the forefront of the anime world, and rightfully so. There was so much hype, whether for good or for bad, and no one could talk anime without bringing up AOT, and then it vanished, more or less, discounting recap movies, live action movies, spin-offs, and every character imaginable cosplayed at conventions. Still unsure whether it was because of budget issues, or timing and keeping in line with the manga, it exited the way it entered, until now that
                  is. In 2017, we received the highly anticipated and much awaited second season of Attack on Titan. This is a season many thought would come sooner, many thought would never come, and one we had been promised for so long. It’s safe to say that with season two of Attack on Titan, they delivered.
For those that are unfamiliar, you REALLY SHOULD go and watch the first season.LIKE GO RIGHT NOW. You really won't regret it to be completely honest.
Picking up more or less right where the first season left us, we are thrown right into the action yet again. The humans are faced with the realization that there are other humans with the capabilities to turn into titans and there seems to be a larger conspiracy at play.
Some of those fears come to fruition as we learn of 4 other humans capable of turning into titans, there may be a group of humans that wish to see the downfall of humanity, and new powers and histories of some of the human-titans also come to light.
This season takes us a little deeper into the characters that weren’t focused on in the first season, and we see many learning how to come to grips with this new reality. We also see several season 1 characters completely omitted or granted very little screen time in this season. The show’s producers and director learned from the first season and are showcasing success with brevity, in that, so much more is done with much less. This season is very focused and really only showcases 3 or so major events, which is an effective strategy. We are uncovering lots of little secrets and details and to allow those to unfold over 3 or 4 episodes each works well. It starts off trying to reassess the current status before diving head first into the action that drew us all to the anime in the first place. It’s half the length of the first season, but it cuts away monotony and pointless sequences a great deal.
It goes without saying that the art and animation is just as amazing as the first season, if not better? The dynamism is at an all time high, and some of the mechanics have been turned up a notch. It seems the 4 years they took to work on the anime was put to good use, in some respects at least. With regards to the manga, there is no comparison. The jump in the art between the manga and the anime is part of what propelled the anime to such heights. One gripe I have is with, like MANY other anime in recent seasons, is the use of CGI that sticks out like a sore thumb in one particular part of the show. I can understand why it was used, but man do I wish they’d lay off of it or just find a way to make it seamless. The scene I’m talking about is with regards to the colossal titan. We see it’s true power and get to experience it move in many directions seamlessly in ways the first season never was able to. It works for to heighten the suspense and thrill of the scene, but it is noticeable.
The music has remained the same for the most part. Hiroyuki Sawano is back with the classic tracks that were perfect the first time around, and he’s even thrown in a few new ones. Some of the old tracks, THE battle song (if you have seen the show, you know) for instance even gets a bit of a remix, for the better of course.
I can’t say it was worth the wait but I am definitely glad Attack on Titan has returned. It delivered and then some and even did a lot of what we loved in the first season even better. The feels are are deeper, action a little more dynamic, and the death is as gruesome and brutal as ever, maybe even a little excessive? It’s a great follow up and it has already been announced that season 3 will return in the spring of next year 2018.
Who knows if that date will be honored, but we will have to see. Either way, it’s a show that is its own enemy, but if it continues with the momentum that has resurfaced, it can really be one for the ages.",9
"
                Season 2 of Attack on Titan is a mess. I'm tempted to say, ""this is where the show jumps the shark"", but I have not yet experienced the later seasons. I guess, season 2 is about that point in the story where the creator decided that his story should have some more twists to it. Unfortunately, Attack on Titan seems to only be able to pull off two kinds of twists:
Type A) The twists that are painfully obvious.
Type B) The twists that end up deflating the weight of the story and almost ruin the wonderful setting of the show.
The writing in general seems awfully sloppy
                  here and very much gives off the feel of ""just making shit up as I go"". Lots of ""do you remember that one life defining moment we had? Here's a flashback sequence of it, because we haven't actually established it (aka the writer only just now came up with it)"". The lack of patience and proper buildup is astounding. If a thing is set up, it will either pay off immediately during the span of one episode or it will be brushed aside and left unresolved for the rest of the season.
I wonder why the story went out of it's way to prevent Annie from acting as the source of our exposition by having her encased in crystal. It basically made the victory at the end of season 1 feel hollow and bitter. But the exposition Annie could have organically delivered gets dumped on us very soon afterwards (in manga release timeframe anyways) by other characters, so her whole cocoon maneuver seems like a net negative for the flow of the story. At the time, I thought the Season 1 ending was bold. ""There are no real victories in war"" -kinda thing. Now, I think it's painfully obvious that it was just the writer stalling for some more time to scramble together some sort of plan.
I am almost certain that Rainer's split personality was an afterthought that had to be worked into the story in order for the character's actions to make any kind of sense in hindsight. Ymir turns her coat so many times in such a short period of time that the coat is basically just flickering on her. I suppose she is supposed to come off as volatile, to keep the audience on the edge of their seats, but it just comes across illogical and frustrating instead.
Attack on Titan still has a lot of great things going for it. The art style and animation is still gorgeous and the Hiroyuki Sawano soundtrack is still A+ quality. The setting, despite season 2's best efforts, is still excellent and the titans are still one of the most horrific monsters I've ever seen in any media. All of this the show still has. But what is actually happening on the screen, in the present, is so tremendously stupid at times that the positive qualities almost don't matter. That is what makes AOT season 2 so frustrating, it completely fumbles with handling the fantastic framework for an epic story that it built for itself during season 1.",5
"
                Attack on Titan is back, and it's back with a BANG!
This season was probably better than the first, and here's why.
Story: 10
Few questions answered, many more awoken; many may find this irritating, but it gets me absolutely hooked. The show is far from over, and more questions means there's far more surprises and twists to be thrown our way. Most of the season was plot oriented, again, this probably let some fans down, but ignoring the ingenious ways Isayama has dropped absolutely bombshells on us was absolutely mind-blowing. Kudo to him, because I honestly thought there was nothing more to this series than just flare
                  and action.
Characters: 9
The characters were far from perfect in season 1. Even the main trio left much to be desired. The only ones with some semblance of character development were Eren (cough) and Levi. 
But season 2 does something unexpected: it removes these two, and suddenly, the canvas opens, with the rest of the cast out in the open. I found myself growing actually attached to them (where in season 1, I really couldn't have cared less. It ran on shock factor alone), and characters like Reiner and freaking Bertholdt showed extreme depth. Hell, I even found myself warming up to Ymir and Christa, and I'd sworn not to get swept away.
But this by no means implies that they ignored the rest, and the season ends with some of the most moving scenes I've seen in the show.
Art: 9
This should have been a 10, honestly. But they threw in CGI where I'm sure it could have been avoided (the budget was clearly all used on Eren's eyes). That's my only complaint, tbh. I still stand strong that episode 6 (or was it 7...) will be rated most incredibly animated fight scene of the year. 
Sound: 10
Not ever one of the show's weak points. SnK is back with a gorgeous OST, an opening I grew to love, and voice actors *coughYukiKajicough* that blew me away just when I thought they couldn't get better.
Overall: 9
not flawless because of frustrating flashbacks and too much time spent with characters not really necessary. But I'm thinking that was to end it at this very specific point, in preparation for a season 3.
HYPE YOURSELVES, FOR IT IS COMING.
(If it gets delayed, I'm reading the manga, cuz I can't handle another 4 years)",9
"
                After years of waiting, the second season of Attack on Titan is finally out. It, like every other anime, has its flaws and strongpoints. 
Let's start with the good things. The character development is superb and I was very glad that it wasn't focused on Eren, Mikasa, and Armin. Instead, we got to learn more about other side characters, such as Ymir, that weren't featured heavily in the first season. Each of these characters have their moments to shine and none of them are boring. I especially loved Erwin in the last few episodes. He truly proved himself as a strong leader who will do
                  anything to find the truth. The animation in this season is noticeably better. The background looks a lot nicer and the opening looks far better than the first one. The art suits the atmosphere and is amazing for the action scenes. Next, the sound for this anime is also great. At first, I didn't really like the opening song as it sounded like a combination of the first and second Attack on Titan openings. However, it soon grew on me and got me very hyped for each episode. Lastly, the intensity and suspense is stronger in this season. The action scenes really get you and every episode leaves you hanging. It's impossible to look away and each episode ends with you going ""What? That was 20 minutes already?"" 
Now the biggest flaw of this anime is the storytelling. The plot gets complicated, which is expected given it's the second season. However, in the last few episodes, it gets quite confusing and viewers simply don't know what is going on. While you're watching though, it doesn't take away from the enjoyment because the intense feelings and action keep you from thinking. It's something you realize after finishing an episode and take the time to reflect on it. The season also heavily relies on flashbacks. These flashbacks aren't useless and are actually very interesting to watch. I just wish that there was more variety as it does seem excessive. 
In conclusion, if you're a fan of action or just want something to pass time with, you most definitely won't be disappointed. This anime, while flawed, is very enjoyable and lives up to the expectations.",9
"
                **CONTAINS SPOILERS**
It has been a year since I have re watched Attack on Titan season 1, and I knew I had to give the rest of the series a shot. I have been the longest fan of AoT (Honestly, it has probably been about 3 years since I first watched it.) and had my fair share of shipping and fangirling. I remember obsessing over it with a few of my friends in middle school, but my feelings have changed quite a bit in the past few years. AoT feels slightly overrated and old, but I guess it is just because I've grown a little detached
                  to the whole series. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a loving fan of AoT, but something just doesn't click with me like it used to.
Story (5/10):
This season went down hill in the story department. I was really hoping that Eren would of discovered his dad's basement and the whole anime wouldn't be dragged out anymore. I'm pretty sure every season 1 fan saw Reiner as the armored titan coming. It's what everyone used to talk about; Who might be a titan and who isn't? This season was really confusing to me. I'm a fan who needs everything to be said straight out loud someplace later on in the anime. I'm still clueless as to why Riener and Bertholdt needed Eren, and where in the world is this hometown? The story just fell short for me, and is still leaving me clueless.
Art (10/10):
The reason why I was so drawn to AoT in the first place is probably because of the art. It is truly unique, and I can't get enough of the environment. I have no issues with how anything is animated or drawn, and I hope the style remains the same throughout the whole series.
Sound (9/10):
The sound is great because it makes me feel like I'm right in the anime. When I first start watching an episode, it is already over before I realize it. I think that is all to do with how the music and background sounds keep me so intrigued into what is going on. The only complaint I have is the opening theme. As much as I love the original AoT openings and endings, I want to see some new music. I don't want to feel as if I'm watching a continuation of season 1. I want to feel as if I'm watching a better version of season 1. It took around 4 years after all.
Character (7/10):
I love learning the backgrounds of characters and what makes them who they are today, but I wish more than just the characters they built up on were portrayed. Especially Connie. He appeared more in this season than the last, and I want more of an explanation of his character. We are probably going to see that in season 3 since his town is being investigated, but I don't know why Connie has such a strong attachment to his village besides the one flashback of him being teased. I want more of a back story on Reiner and Bertholdt. The only thing we know exactly from this season is this hometown and how Ymir ate one of their comrades. I don't remember much of them from season 1 because they just weren't as interesting. 
Enjoyment (8/10):
There were many moments where I was yelling at the characters to just do something and stop being so idiotic, but that's what made me enjoy it so much. I loved looking forward to what was going to happen next. I just wished there were more heart felt moments that really made me feel for the characters. I couldn't sympathize with most of them, so I couldn't cry or feel happy for them. I was mostly just happy or sad for the situation and not for the character.
Overall (8/10):
It was a good experience and I'm looking forward to season 3. I just hope Eren will now get a hold of himself and start stepping up his game. Eren has only killed 1 titan in human form out of 37 episodes. He is the main character that everyone has their hopes on. I wish I could give him my hope too, but he is just so pathetic. The whole time I was just secretly rooting for Eren to turn onto Reiner and Bertholdt's side. I knew it was impossible, but I just want Eren to calm down and think for himself instead of letting his anger get the best of him all the time. The only reason a lot of the higher ups look to him is because he has the strength of a titan. If someone like Ymir let everyone know she was a titan from the start, they would be using her just like how they are using Eren and his titan powers. As for the ending, the person at the monkey titan really reminded me of Eren's dad because of the glasses. I think it was said once that the reason Eren is a titan is because of his dad, so perhaps Eren's dad is a titan as well. I just can't believe they waited 4 years between season 1 and season 2. Now they waited only a year between season 2 and 3. Overall, this is worth a watch and really gets your mind going. I'm glad I watched it.",8

                (This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)
I consider myself one of what I like to call the “Attack on Titan baby boomers.”
I had never hated or looked down on anime; I had just never cared enough about it to see what it could be. When fate put this gateway series in front of me during the Summer of 2013, however, I was kicking myself for not taking part in the medium at an earlier point in my life.
Technically speaking, it wouldn’t be until months later (in early-ish 2014) that I officially dove into anime and became hooked on all that it
                  offers. My initial experience with Shingeki no Kyojin left a positive impression on me that eventually contributed to my growing interest in this hobby and thus got me to where I am today.
Four years later, Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2 finally drops. And with it come rushing back the feelings and the memories that I fondly remember of that time from long ago.
STORY
The first season of Attack on Titan overwhelmed the anime community like a bunch of Titans crashing through Wall Maria. It captivated audiences with a unique premise and tons of interesting developments, but, more importantly, it ushered in a new wave of anime fans who grew the community at an exponential rate.
So, for many people who take part in the medium, Attack on Titan Season 2 represents a return to their origins. The sequel to the anime that pushed them into this crazy world filled with moe, tsunderes, and ahoges. Thus, this situation makes this season have a lot to live up to in terms of expectations and promises. But after these past four years, does the show deliver?
It first goes back to its roots. Grotesque deaths. Creepy, gigantic enemies. Killer Titan duels. Mikasa in full (and then some) yandere mode. Eren screaming and biting a whole bunch. The world-building information that pops up during the transition between the A and B parts of each episode. The ominous atmosphere. In short, the anime brings along much of what got it to this point, reacquainting and reminiscing with the audience like an old friend.
Following in its predecessor’s footsteps isn’t everything it has in store. Indeed, the show addresses a prominent problem from the previous season: pacing. Where once the plot ramped up, time skipped, reeled back, waited a bit, and then sped ahead again whenever it wanted, this season instead takes a more nominal approach. The events take place within a span of about twenty-four hours, doing away with the constant back-and-forth jerking of the progression in favor of spacing out each important scene in a natural manner.
In turn, these scenes space out their focus. To elaborate, the first season (understandably) had Eren stealing the show since, at the end of the day, he’s the main protagonist through and through. While not repetitive by any means, the anime did not leave a ton of time for everyone else (save for maybe Mikasa).
So, in an effort to improve diversity, Attack on Titan Season 2 puts more emphasis on other parts and parties of and within the cast. Sasha’s aside with the lone child and her own father. Connie and the loss of his family’s town. Reiner and Bertholdt with Ymir and Krista in the dilapidated tower.
Eren and Mikasa are (perhaps obviously) still around, playing out their vital roles all the same. But spreading out the focus, combined with the shorter episode count, makes the story here feel more like (appropriately enough) a human-wide battle on multiple fronts instead of just “Eren: The Titan: The Show.”
Thankfully not changing are the anime’s hype moments. Thinking back, the first season had several of its own: Eren’s “death”, the fact that he can literally transform into a Titan, Annie killing everyone in Levi’s crew.
Truth be told, this season’s moments are not as amazing since, unlike the ones that came before them, they do not set the original tone and direction of the anime itself. Nevertheless, they introduce hype of a different kind. Reiner’s confession that he and Bertholdt are the Armored and Colossal Titans (respectively) takes the audience off guard with its offhand delivery. Erwin losing his arm happens so suddenly and so out of nowhere that one cannot help but be taken aback. And Eren seemingly having the power to control multiple Titans simultaneously marks the first time a plausible solution emerges for how to defeat their ilk (besides Eren needing to take on every single one singlehandedly).
By far the biggest issue that this season grapples with, though, is introducing way too many more questions than it does answers. From posits in the past, the audience already has enough on their mind to wonder about and deal with. E.g., What the heck is in that basement? Yet, for this season, the anime is perfectly content with throwing in mystery after mystery that remains unsolved come the final episode.
Who do Reiner and Bertholdt report to? What role does the Coordinator serve? Where does the Beast Titan come from? When will details about the church and the Titan-filled walls come about? Why did the humans seemingly become Titans themselves? What about Annie? Where is Eren’s dad, anyway?
It totally makes sense that the anime does not wish to unveil the mystery of its plot quite yet. And the audience can, to some extent, extrapolate on the info presented. But, after thirty-seven episodes, the ratio between what is left up in the air and what has been explained so far is too large and too lopsided, requiring the viewer to accept and to believe almost everything too little knowledge.
However, if one were to ignore these questions and view Attack on Titan Season 2 as simply a project aiming for maximum entertainment, then there’s little cause for worry. Armin eats rations with stoic determination. Mikasa has a this-is-the-end, may-as-well-be romantic moment with Eren. Eren himself yells at Reiner for being a traitor and defeats him in a one-on-one brawl in epic fashion. Indeed, what made non-anime fans into anime fans after watching this series was not worrying about the stalled plot but rather welcoming the nonstop, downright cool events that go down.
So, yes, Hannes literally stopping the hand of the Titan that killed Eren’s mother with just his body doesn’t make any logical sense. And sure, none of the major characters still have yet to kick the bucket despite the harrowing predicaments they constantly find themselves in.
But it all remains exhilarating and fun no matter the case – and that’s all that really matters.
ART & ANIMATION
The first season of Attack on Titan had some impressive visuals. Eren in Titan form demolishing his foes or shots of the cadets as they zipped around the city they vied to protect made for an engrossing watch. However, due to the extended two-cour nature of the season or other similar reasons, it wasn’t without fault, sometimes avoiding animation altogether with nothing but a close-up of a face and a white background.
For this season, with all eyes on the project and more than enough revenue to justify spending extra on resources, it almost doesn’t disappoint.
First, the anime embraces much of the style from before. Thick outlines define the characters’ designs, giving them a powerful grit to their demeanor. Darker colors (browns, forest greens, greys) depress the mood. Titans maintain their weird gaits, expressions, and buffoonery that invite their undoubted creepiness.
Second, the anime ups the ante by showcasing awesome scenes that prove what it can do. Mikasa and Krista dance and twirl through the sky as they use their gear with utmost precision. Ymir swings through trees and jumps from Titan to Titan. Chaos consumes the battlefield as Erwin’s charge turns hopeless.
Yet, in fairness, Attack on Titan Season 2 makes a few questionable decisions. Fans of the series have been spoiled with the intimidating look of the Colossal Titan from the first season, so it comes off as a little bit of a letdown when its appearance in this season takes the form of some out-of-place CG. Humans riding on their horses can also fall prey to this issue. And, at times, there can be one too many static images (even if they are rather involved) when a ton of action starts to happen.
But the picturesque landscapes. The variance in lighting. The jostling of hair as the characters ride atop the Titans. The detailed eyes. The manic reactions. The shifting camerawork. The cool tricks like a shot of Ymir with half her human face and half her Titan face. These and other elements overpower the minor grievances in the art, keeping the visuals as engrossing and as interesting as possible.
CHARACTERS
The Attack on Titan series has never really been concerned with creating exceptional characters. To be fair, the first season explores the origins of Mikasa’s adoration for Eren, and Eren himself learns about and struggles with his newfound power. But, for the most part, the large cast of characters are there to add diversity in the personalities. Plus, the show in general focuses on presenting a thrilling, intense story first and foremost.
For Attack on Titan Season 2, that’s still the case, but the anime starts to lean more towards the characters and their nuances. A direction that makes a lot of sense since the first season established the setting and the major ideas and the premise, leaving any and all follow-ups with the burden of exploring the cast at a deeper level.
For example, Ymir, who was little more than the taller, tomboyish girl who overprotected Krista, receives extra attention. Her backstory comes to light – both the origins of her actual person and the relationship she created with Krista back during their cadet training – and the situation tests her mettle – both her physical (i.e., Titan) capabilities and her own conscious.
While Ymir (maybe oddly) has the most time spent on her, more so than mainstays Mikasa and Eren, many of the characters still get something here. Sasha proves that she can handle more than just a bunch of potatoes. Reiner’s sanity no longer seems to be intact. And speaking of Mikasa and Eren, Mikasa’s iron will fails her when she subconsciously restrains herself from outright killing her “friends,” and Eren finally maintains control over his Titan form and even gets his very first as-a-human kill.
Smaller connections also pop up between the cast. Hannes holds a conversation with Mikasa and Armin about Eren’s tenacity, inspiring them to push forward since he would do the same. Ymir apparently attacked Reiner and Bertholdt’s group in the past (unbeknownst to her), killing one of their friends in the process. And the show even implies that Bertholdt himself may have a thing for Annie, going off of Reiner’s prodding and Bertholdt’s own emotional reaction to Armin’s grim words.
That scene between those two also demonstrates Attack on Titan Season 2’s continued focus on what it takes to survive in such an impossible situation.
The idea goes way back to Eren’s Titan transformation from the first season. More than just a really cool plot element, it also highlights how humanity, to defeat their inhuman threat, must become inhuman themselves. This dichotomy makes for some nice writing since it challenges what is “right” and “wrong” when the stakes are so high.
To use the anime’s phrasing, the characters abandon something to gain something in return. In Eren’s case, he takes it to heart, literally turning into the very entity he despises. A very physical approach.
In this season, the characters make it more of a philosophical or psychological abandonment. For instance, Armin, known for his kindness and his honesty, abandons his morals, lying to Bertholdt about torturing Annie to get that rise out of him that they needed. Mikasa abandons her sense of kinship when she no longer cares about anyone who would seek to harm Eren. Reiner and Bertholdt abandon their own lives for (what they presumably see as) the greater good. Ymir and Krista abandon their selflessness in favor of selfishness as they choose to fight for nobody else but their own selves.
Again, none of the developments here stand out as anything complex let alone amazing. But, the anime clearly struck a better balance between the characters’ arcs and the story at large, inviting a stronger semblance of execution as a result.
MUSIC & SOUND
Inevitably, one must compare this season’s music with that of the first season. The opening track especially requires the most scrutiny. After all, the very first OP stands as one of the most memorable and iconic in the entire medium.
Unfortunately, “Shinzou wo Sasageyo!” cannot compete with the past juggernaut, but it still does what it can to elicit from the audience similar feelings of awesomeness and energy. Its tempo and composition hearkens back to those previous pieces. The chants of “Sasageyo!” – backed by a rousing choir no less – pumps up the audience. And the triumphant instrumental work follows the pride in humanity’s drive to win at all costs.
Perhaps surprisingly, the ending track, titled “Yuugure no Tori,” ends up as the better of the two songs if only because it strikes at a nuanced mood. Warped singing, acoustic guitar, faint piano keys, and a methodical beat combine to create something simultaneously unsettling, promising, and bittersweet. A creepy piece that chills the spines of the audience upon the conclusion of each episode.
While the OP and the ED aim for something new, Attack on Titan Season 2 does not deviate from the incredible original soundtrack that many would argue to be one of the show’s strongest aspects.
It was with this series that the now-famous Hiroyuki Sawano had his breakout musical performance, crafting grandiose pieces that quake in their power and resonate in their passion. The heaviness. The forceful instrumentals. The vocals. The emotional asides. The Germanic lyricism. This OST is awesome to listen to on its own even to this day, but hearing it once again alongside the anime itself reaffirms its domination within the medium.
The rest of the audio work maintains its worth as well. Thundering stomps from the Titans and the whizzing of the 3D Maneuver Gear make for fitting sound effects, and the voice acting performances – especially Yuki Kaji as Eren and Yui Ishikawa as Mikasa – harbor range and skill as they scream, cry, and confess with ferocity, anger, and thoughtfulness.
ENJOYMENT
I have a few reasons as to why I love this season and this series as much as I do.
One of the bigger reasons is Mikasa. In general, she kicks butt, she pines after Eren, and she cutes it up with personable moments on rare occasions. For this season, her yandere reactions were awesome, and she had those wicked moments, too. Ever since I first saw her flying around way back in the first season, I instantly became a fan, and she will always hold a nostalgic place somewhere in my heart.
Another big reason is the intensity. As some of my readers know, I’m not usually taken in by a lot of the action that many shows showcase. But, here in this anime, it goes outside the box per se with its unique 3D Maneuver Gear segments and Eren’s Titan-versus-Titan brawls. I get pumped up so much that I start to punch the air and even attempt to imitate Eren’s Titan battle cry.
The biggest reason, however, is something a lot more personal.
In my opening anecdote, I talked about how this series is my very first anime. What I didn’t mention was that it was my little brother who convinced me to give it a shot. He was already half way through the season at the time, but he rewatched it from the beginning with me so that we could have fun together.
We would turn off the lights and hook up the speakers to give it more of a movie-theater feel. He saw my incredulity and shock at Eren’s death and subsequent Titan takeover. And we argued about whether the Armored Titan (my vote) or the Colossal Titan (his vote) was the cooler enemy.
For this second season, we have grown up and reached different parts of our lives. However, when the circumstances allowed, we met up and watched the episodes together once again. Hyping at the music. Discussing what the heck just happened. Pointing out small details. Wondering where it will go from here. It had been years since the last time we did so, but it felt just like old times.
Strangely enough, I’m the one who went further into the crazy world of anime, having it become an integral part of my life when I never imagined that it would. Thus, I’ve since expanded my tastes quite a bit. I suggest anime to him here and there, and he of course has his own favorites, but he doesn’t take it to the same extent that I do.
Still, this anime is the only one my brother and I have ever bonded over let alone the only anime I have ever watched with another person. And that fact means a lot to me. The memories associated with it, the laughs we have shared, the fun of everything. I like Mikasa’s character, and I like the intensity of the show. But, for me, it’s getting to share something special with my one and only little brother that I cherish most about this series.
It was the same back then. It’s the same now. And it’ll remain that way for me forevermore.
Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2 is a welcome sequel for this beloved franchise. Improved art and a revival of previous music may support the whole package quite heavily, but the exciting story beats, the new variety of characters focused on, and the sheer amount of entertainment throughout argue that the magic therein is still booming.
SUMMARY
Story: Fine, while bogged down by too many unanswered questions, the narrative holds its own with familiar elements, hype moments, and better displacement of focus
Art & Animation: Great, out-of-place CG aside, the high level of detail in the artistry and the penchant for slick animated segments present a set of engrossing visuals that make for a clear step up from its predecessor
Characters: Fine, despite the thrilling plot receiving the most attention, Eren and the others earn small details as they continue to explore survival through abandonment of their more philosophical or psychological traits
Music & Sound: Great, the series’ incredible OST returns, carrying with it a rousing OP, an unsettling ED, nice VA performances, and lots of interesting audio design choices
Enjoyment: Great, Mikasa rocks, the intensity cannot be denied, and brotherly bonding
Final Score: 8/10",8
"
                So it's finally done and after waiting 4 years for only 12 episodes, was it worth it? Well that depends on if you're reading the manga and how much you enjoyed season 1. This season wasn't disappointing, besides it only being 12 episodes that it. For the most part this was a really solid second season and with the conformation of season 3 coming next year I can't wait to see what happens next. Also I won't be comparing this to the manga and will try not to spoil anything. 
Story: 7
One thing you will notice at the very beginning of the first episode is
                  that after the 2 minute recap this continues immediately after where season 1 left off. They even titled these episodes as 26-37 which I really appreciated. Anyway the first episode started off fantastic. They knew actually how to start of this season by showing off the beast titan, the survey corps destroying titans and even killing someone off. This hype however dies down right after the first episode. The next couple episodes focus on the side characters and give some information of the titans and the wall. This is probably the seasons's biggest problem and it also happens after episode 7 where they focus on the characters instead of the titans and all of the unanswered questions. That's not to say these episodes are bad, it's just not what I wanted and considering the first season's characters were pretty meh, it's not something I wanted to see much of. But when we do get details on the titans and see the story progress it's awesome. One thing season 2 did do better than the previous season was it's pacing. The second half of season 1's pacing was not as good as the first half and felt slow at times. For the most part these pacing issues are fixed, again for the most part. This season's story was better but hopefully now that we know more about the characters season 3 will focus more on providing information on it's mysterious story.
Art: 10
Just like season 1, Attack on Titan continues to look breath taking and one of the most impressive looking animes out there. The action scenes are fantastic and when there's not any action going on you can enjoy the beautiful backgrounds and see just how much work and detail they put into everything. Thank god there's no CG in this. No problems here.
Sound: Again, just like with its animation this season continues to provide a great and memorable soundtrack. The background music can range from peaceful to downright epic battle music. This is definitely something I look forward to listening to again and again. My only complaint is that the OP isn't as good as season 1's famous first OP. But then again that's not easy to accomplish. 
Characters: 6.5
Season 1's characters were by far it's biggest problem. Eren is just average, Mikasa is okay, Armin is just there. That pretty much sums up the characters: ""They're just there."" There's nothing special or memorable about them. Sasha (""Potato Girl"") was the only one that stood out, but then again that was only one scene. Season 2 fixes some of these problems. The side characters that were mostly forgotten in the first season are actually relevant and important now. I actually remember some of their names now. Still characters like Eren and Armin are still meh. You don't even see Levi in action which was one of the better characters before. Season 2 does show development on forgotten and useless characters and gives us a backstory on them as well. My problem is that this should have been done in season 1, not 26 episodes in. 
Enjoyment: 8
For the most part I enjoyed season 1 of AOT and did end up enjoying this season a bit more. If you liked season 1 you'll really enjoy this, if you thought season 1 was average then you might think this is just okay. But the point is it's Attack on Titan, and this season is just better in almost every way. 
Overall: 8
Attack on Titan Season 2 is an improvement over it's predecessor and hopefully season 3 will follow this trend and be even better. This season continued to include the same quality of animation and music, had an overall good story with some problems and improvements on the characters. This was overall very good.",8
"
                After the first season of Attack on Titan I had thought the show was very good but it had a lot of problems. I would not have been able to name you any characters aside from Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Levi, and Annie because three of them are the main characters and the other two had stand out memorable moments. Also with the way the story was being developed after the first season it made it incredibly hard to get any sense of horror from it. Shocking moments happened sure but nothing that made me quiver.
Well surprise surprise this season fixed these problems for me. After
                  this season I can now tell you almost every major side character in the show (Ymir, Reiner, Bert, Conny, Sasha, Christa, ect apologize if I misspell ) because they were actually given the time to show us what they were all about and develop and even Eren himself was given a chance to breath and not shoved in our faces the whole time. Quite a few deaths especially in the first half were brutal and haunting. Wit Studio went the extra mile to give us some psychological horror instead of just physical horror.
In conclusion Wit Studio kept what was great about the first season and fixed what wasn't good for this second season. If you liked the first season I see no reason why you wouldn't love this one and if you didn't like the first season then there is a chance this season might be a big improvement for you. As for me this was a lot better than I expected and I am happy for that.",9
"
                Brief review as an anime-only watcher, no spoilers:
As commander Erwin would put it, if you haven't watched this season yet - SUSUME! What are you waiting for?
While season 1 of Shingeki no Kyojin (aka Attack on Titan or AoT) was quite prone to melodrama, and was a little too punctuated by the MC trying to push his vocal cords to the limit while simultaneously trying to pop his eyes out, S2 feels like a much more mature show - with heavy elements of mystery and world-building taking the forefront. The action from the first season is still there, better than ever before. Wit Studio delivers
                  on every front.
Story (9/10): There are no brakes on this crazy train. As mentioned before, this season gives a major emphasis on the mystery surrounding this bizarre Titan infested world. Where did they come from? Why do they kill humans? With this season, we finally get to step a little bit closer to the truth. The story is gripping, even depressing at times, almost reminiscent of the hopelessness in parts of A Song of Ice and Fire.
Art (10/10): Wit Studio did a fantastic job bringing the manga to life. Some CGI has been used, but it does not look out of place at all. Be prepared for some outstanding action sakuga as well as outright gorgeous-looking scenes.
Sound (9/10): The background music isn't outstanding, but nor is it bad - it's unassuming, and lets the plot take the forefront. The OP and ED are excellent, and the visuals are quite memorable - the ED especially, with a bizarre representation of the history of the AoT world.
Character (8/10): A lot of 'minor' characters from S1 get a lot of limelight here, to great effect - Eren isn't a very likable MC, and getting some time off from his antics allows the show to flourish. 
Enjoyment (10/10): It's a wild ride from start to finish. There's mystery, horror, depression, death, crazy twists - even unintentional humour packed into this season. 
Overall (9/10): Significantly better than the first season - to the point where it pulls the entire franchise up in my eyes. I'm eagerly looking forward to S3 to see more of the world of AoT being revealed. If you even mildly like season 1, watch this!",9

                ""People, who can’t throw something important away, can never hope to change anything."" - Armin Arlet
Attack on Titan season 2 is very distinctly different from season 1, in which the tone shifted from a epic action series to a thriller mystery. And although I do appreciate the increased sense of maturity, I feel like I got slightly cheated. I was drawn into AOT for the scenes of them using their 3D maneuver gear(lol), so it was quite disappointing when there were barely any scenes of that. However, I commend the series for paralysing me with their amazing usage of suspense in the first few episodes,
                  but sadly it was not continued in the later ones. Season 2 has answered many questions, but at the same time many more questions were being raised and I really do see the potential of the plot, and I really do wish for a spectacular ending that can tie up all loose ends and wrap up the entire story nicely. 
Another great aspect of season 2 was the development of side characters, something that was completely overlooked in the first season. Because now I actually give a shit about the extended cast(and finally remember their names too) and not just the main 3. Every character was given decent development and their personalities were explored on a deeper level. Season 1 brushed them off as insignificant, merely labeling them with a certain trait, making them appear flat and boring. But season 2 has completely reversed that probably so that if they ever die more tears will be shed :( All the characters have now matured a fair bit, and although the mains appear way lesser this time around, the scenes of them had far more impact. 
However, back on why I still prefer season 1, is on the pace of the show. As the episodes went on, there were times where I felt the story wasn't moving anywhere but trapped at a juncture in between all the exposition and flashbacks. And with only 12 episodes that only covered a single arc, it was needless to say quite boring at times. I'm not sure if its just me, but the art this time around seems to be better than season 1's and despite lacking action sequences, there were many picturesque shots that were framed really well. The animation was smooth as usual and overall it was a feast for my eyes. The soundtrack was also really amazing, being extremely fitting to the nature of the different scenes, adding onto the suspense and allowing myself to immerse more into the scene. 
Attack on titan, just like the first, is definitely worth the watch, but at times the story goes around in circles a little that it loses my interest.",8
"
                TL;DR - The second season is full of awesome battles and plot advancement, as well as character development, and is definitely worth watching for those who are interested and have seen the first season.
STORY: 10/10
While the first season of Shingeki no Kyojin was more of a head scratcher than a nail biter, the second season is extremely satisfying to those who want to see more of the plot unfold, and get a few answers to questions that were raised in the very first episode. That being said, it also poses a lot of new questions, and as is the hallmark of any great story, it
                  leaves you dying for more at the end of every episode. Throw in a batch of character development for some of the hitherto unimportant characters from the first season, and of course plenty of gory action scenes, and you've got a story that really starts to feel like it knows what it's talking about.
ART: 8/10
I gave the first season quite a scathing review of the art style. Having since read the manga, I now realize that most of the perceived flaws are because of the original manga artist's style, or lack thereof (too bad you can't go back and edit old reviews!). Once you take that into consideration, there is little to complain about, especially if you're a gore fan who just wants to see it rain blood and guts all the time. The characters are easy to identify on sight nowadays, and as far as censorship... is there any? There's never a moment where it's just a big black blotch covering a bloody mess, and if they zoom out a bit on the most gruesome moments, it's usually to show the chaos reflected in the eyes of whoever is witnessing it at the moment. 
SOUND: 7/10
This show could do with a better score. I only say that because, even at times of high tension, which is almost always, I found myself drifting away sometimes and having to snap my attention back to what's happening. The score is generally what is supposed to keep your subconscious aware of what is about to happen, or how you should be feeling about what is happening, and sometimes there's just none of that. Outside of that, there's not much to complain about. Every time a titan eats someone, there's a pretty satisfying crunch. The opening and the ending are both pretty great IMO, but that's not really what I'm reviewing here, is it? 
CHARACTER: 8/10
As I said in the beginning, we get a decent bit of character development in this season. You could even say a surprising amount considering everything else that happens in only 12 episodes. Some of the characters still feel a bit bland, a bit one dimensional, or a bit too cliche (looking at you Eren). However, the characters feel pretty realistic compared to a lot of shows these days, not often breaking character for no reason. This consistency lends a lot to a show that defines itself by inflicting inhuman terror on all-too-human characters. 
ENJOYMENT: 10/10
I also mentioned before that I'm up to date on the manga, so very few secrets were revealed to me during this season, if any. That being said, I looked forward to the new episode every week, and when I wasn't home at the time of its release (insert shameless Crunchyroll plug here) I found myself anxious to get home and watch it. Trust me when I say that the manga NEEDS this adaptation, and I eagerly await the coming seasons. Reading the manga just isn't as satisfying as watching every action scene unfold in real time, and hearing the screams of terror and the enraged battle-cries of the characters. Hell, even while watching a couple random episodes to refresh my memory for this review, I could feel myself getting sucked in again. 
OVERALL: 9/10
I rounded up just a bit, but this show deserves a 9. It's no masterpiece, but for the middle child of an acclaimed first season, and a promised third season (confirmed for 2018 from what I've heard), it delivers in ways that are so satisfying that you wonder why every anime, or every show in general, can't be like this one. It truly shines in terms of setting a good pace, keeping you interested, and providing a great balance between horrific battles and sober reminders that there IS indeed a plot unfolding behind everything that's happening. This is not the show that many feared it would be, and it really does intend to answer (almost) all of your questions, but will keep you guessing until the very end. Have faith my friends, this show is living up to the hype, and then some.",9
"
                First hearing that this would be only 12-parter after so many years was disappointment and still is but this season was every bit as good in what it offered as the first one. Delivering the on par with the first season Opening theme and art. Story of course only focused heavily on this certain event so they had more than enough time to develop all the motives and story behind everything solidly. Slight disappointment still shows on score so it gets 8.4/10, 8/10. It is difficult to keep with high expectations from the first season but the studio managed to piece up a good continuation
                  to that even though it was a bit short.",8
"
                After 4 long, hard years of waiting and yet to only find out there's gonna be an only 12 episode season, Attack on Titan is back! Overall, was it worth the wait?
Hell 
Yeah
The previous season of AOT had many things going for it. A well developed plot, sick animation and art, Hiroyuki Sawano producing the soundtrack and all. But in the end, season 1 was great, but it always felt like it was lacking something.
Depth.
But this season? This season is exactly what I wanted from AOT and I waited for so long for this but I'm glad I did. So much went down this season, its crazy how they fit it all into just 12 episodes. But they did it, and did it flawlessly. 
The characters are mainly the reason why season 2 is such a huge improvement. Back in season 1, the characters mostly felt dull and bland, and died before they could get any proper depth or at least information about them. But after this season, I love so many more of the characters. They actually give them development, and depth. Reiner, Berthdolt, Christa, and Ymir in particular stood out this season.
The art style did experience a noticeable slight change, most likely due to the fact that Wit Studio was kinda on their own here, whereas last season Production I.G. and Wit doubled up on the animation. But Wit Studio did an amazing job with the animation. The art is just gorgeous. Almost every frame from this season could be hung up in a frame and sold to make millions. The titan transformation sequences were epic, the action was STUNNING, and the CGI they used for the colossal titan wasn't that bad either.
Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. I searched for and downloaded almost every track from season 2 I could find. It's great. End of story.
But overall, I was absolutely thrilled by AOT season 2. Sure, its only 12 episodes, but we're getting another season next year, and since Wit Studio is wrapping up Kabaneri and Ancient Magus Bride, there's a chance that the next season will be a full 25 episode season.
But yes, Attack on Titan season 2 is absolutely worth watching, and is exactly what Attack on Titan season 1 should've been, except even better. 
No doubt,

                I'll keep this short because my keyboard has become wank.
Story -
Eren is still has a big mouth and weak swing while Blonde Jesus is all inspirational and shouty and sh*t.
The story in this season went nowhere. We learned one or two things about the Titans but that's about it. But wait... what actually consumes the 12 episodes in this series? By the time you reach the end of it, nothing is what you'll come to realize. The 12 episodes are literally a cat and mouse chase between goodies and baddies, Tom and Jerry style, where the first few episodes piggyback off of everything that happened
                  in the first season and the second half beg you to ""bare with us until season 3"".
The end of season 2 puts us exactly in the same place that it started except now everybody is scared that they might secretly be a titan and we have King Kong prowling about the place like some kind of 80's TV presenter.
The only thing that keeps it from being worse than mediocre is the fact that the major plot points in this series are pretty f*cking major and do warrant an ""oooooh shiieeettt"" reaction. As much as I talk shit, you can't skip this season under and circumstances simply because there are a few sentences of significance.
Art and Sound -
This shit is pretty polished, colorful and well animated. I can see why it took half an eon to create but in all honesty, you could always have expected more.
There was this one moment towards the end of the series that was executed extremely well thanks to the art and design. Big ol' thumbs up in this department.
The sound is pretty much the same as season one except the intro doesn't sound like communist propaganda this time around.
Character - 
In season one, which I just realized I haven't reviewed, there were plenty of reasons to like the characters. They had spirit, they were bad ass and they shined in certain lights. Take Erin, who has a constant drive to surpass expectations and express his determination to succeed in his life goal of killing all of the Je...Titans. That kind of carries over to this season but in a way that you will eventually get VERY sick of.
If you haven't guessed already or simply haven't watched it yet. I'm talking about monologues. EVERY F*CKING EPISODE Eren has a 5-minute long speech about how he ""has to win"" or ""must prevail"" or how ""X is a traitor"" and ""Y must die"". I sh*t you not, it happens so often that our beloved voice actor (for the dub) must have made his throat bleed by constantly doing his cringy fake anime shouty voice.
This, of course, wouldn't be such a problem if it weren't the ONLY thing that he (or many others) do. Speaking of other characters, they kind of just feel like shadows to Eren. Everybody loves sucking Eren's c*ck because ""Eren is the savior"". While its true that he is important the show treats everyone else like limbless pieces of flesh with no tactical significance and completely ignores the fact that Eren has practically been extra baggage for the entire fucking story up until now.
Enjoyment and Conclusion -
The constant monologues and the destination-less plot made it quite a bore for me but while I was watching it I must admit there were a few moments where I thought ""Oh fuck yeah"" and lost myself in the badassery of the moment. It was purely the conclusion that let me down so much.
I won't tell you not to watch it. You lonely bastards have been waiting almost 4 years for this shit. Might as well take it because you'll probably be dead by the time this thing finishes.",6
"
                Story: 10 I LOVE the pacing! This season is much more entertaining in my opinion because of the pacing! I already knew what was going to happen and still, I was gasping whenever the plot was revealed. I was sitting on the edge of my seat at every twist and turn the plot took! 
Art: 10 Gorgeous as always 
Sound: 10 Wonderful 
Character: 9 They cut a lot of character development out. But every anime does that to some extent so that is not an issue. 
Enjoyment: 10/10! It was like being on a rollercoaster. A rollercoaster that you can watch? Not a very good
                  execution of an analogy I know, but I can not stress anymore how wonderful the pacing of this story is!",10
"
                The best anime of the year is over and I am indeed impressed. After a long wait, we get a Season 2 adaption of Attack on Titan. In this season we carry on from right after Season 1. 
Story-10
The story is brilliant. Once again depicting the lives of Eren, Armim, Mikasa and the other humans from within the wall. This is all about the humans fighting the titans for vengeance and slowly understanding the world of the titans. We see the struggles of almost every character and ways in which they develop too. The pacing is great and follows the manga extremely well. The animation
                  is also good for what it is and extremely well done for a 12 episode season. 
Art-10
The art is amazing and shows the experiences of each character rather well.
Soundtrack-10
Having that amazing soundtrack present are one of the factors that keeps me engaged in the story. It literally makes you want to jump out of your seat and fight some titans.
Voice Actors-10
The voice actors are amazing. Especially, the voice of Eren, Christa, Ymir, Bertolt, Mikasa and so on, you can feel some realism through those voice actors.
Character-10
Lets just say that if you want to see more of the characters that you know and love, then Season 2 is the answer for you. You would have the cast from Season 1 of Attack on Titan growing even further in development and skills. With of course a few more new characters to add to the roster. 
Enjoyment-10
So far so good. This anime is clearly the best of the season. Each episode gets you wanting more and more. After waiting 4 or so years after Season 1, then you can realize how much of an amazing feel this is. This contains the cast from Season 1 and more, the hinting of events to come and a masterful story with complex characters. 
Overall-10
I am thoroughly enjoying this series, the characters, the animation, the story and the culmination of all the things that I have waited for. However, I would recommend that you would not jump into this season straight away. Watch from Season 1 to Season 2, mainly because this helps you understand and refresh your mind for future episodes.",10
"
                In my opinion, this was the weakest of the three seasons for Attack on Titan. To articulate why this is, I’m going to start by saying that season 3 has a fairly different focus and feel than season 1. Season 1 is a striking shounen that is all about the “protagonist against the world” focus. Season 3 feels much more like a political drama that Eren is just a part of. Both seasons 1 and 3 (so far) have a very polished and succinct feeling to them, but season 2 lacks this because it is trying to make the transition, and for a while, the
                  direction and focus of the anime becomes hazy which is frustrating after such a fast paced and driven first season. 
I also took issue with this season’s use of cliff-hangers. Many episodes felt like no monumental action was happening during the bulk of the episode, and then bam, excitement, but no wait, we’re just going to end the episode here. The fact that this was done in almost every episode was off putting and made the season as a whole feel choppy because it seemed like climactic moments that should be allowed to flow were cut in half just to facilitate edgy cliff-hangers in an attempt to simulate the momentum the first season had. 
While I enjoyed the character developments of Ymir, Christa, and others who were less prominent in the first season, I was pretty disappointed in how Mikasa was reduced to Eren’s fangirl babysitter. I know she’s always been Eren’s babysitter, but being such a badass, it seems like this Eren obessesion character development was the lamest and dullest direction she could be taken in.
Despite my complaints, season 2 is a necessary part of Attack on Titan as a whole (which I still hold in very high regard in terms of enjoyment and entertainment value) and is not by any means difficult to watch. The struggle of humanity and the examination of society in this dystopia are still poignant and the stories told in this season are still gripping. It’s just not as good as what came before or what comes after.",6
"
                I watched the first season about 3 months ago (succumbed to the hype) and I was very impressed. When i found out season 2 was coming out this year, I was really excited for SNK2. Luckily it didn't disappoint. 
Story: 9 Continuing where the first season left off, we now know of three of titans and their identities. No complaints about the progression of the story and I liked how they incorporated the flashbacks in the episodes too although it was slightly confusing during the first few minutes as I had to click to prior episodes to make sure I didn't miss anything.

                  change in art style from the last season. The animation has upped in quality and scenes are very fluid.
Sound: 9 We have Hiroyuki Sawano again. Music is epic. That is all. I like the OP and ED more this season. 
Character: 9  The other scouts got some screentime and background stories and I'm not hating it. In fact, I'm glad they cut out a lot of Eren's screentime as I found him somewhat naive and annoying in the first season. 
Enjoyment: 9 This is one of the animes I look forward to watching every week. Episode 7 ended on a cliffhanger and I'm dying to see what happens next. 
Overall: 9 I really enjoyed this season and I'm pretty disappointed that this is only getting 12 episodes. Definitely would recommend if you enjoyed the first season and I will be rewatching after all the episodes are out.",9

                Contains spoilers.
Shingeki no Kyojin's first season wasn't spectacular.  It had horrid pacing issues, and everything felt so drawn out and slow that I found myself bored half to death for most of the episodes.  During the first season's airing, I would watch the episodes only to come back to reality twenty minutes later feeling like I had just awoken from a horrific fever dream with awful characters, tortoise-like pacing and mediocre writing with long, drawn-out action scenes.  Only on subsequent rewatches of the series did I realize that there were more glaring issues than I cared to deal with, and I found
                  myself dropping the show several times out of either boredom or not caring about the characters or the plot enough to continue.  The series was losing its gritty, high-stakes flavor at a rapid pace and the rush I felt whenever a character killed a Titan was fading as well.  It was a good show to watch if you wanted to turn your brain off, but I couldn't.  I didn't expect much of the second season because of this.
But, to my surprise, I found myself actually enjoying the second season far more than I did the first.  A lot of the things I didn't like about the first season were remedied in the second.
The story begins after the battle between Titan Eren and Annie in one of the districts of Wall Sina whose name I can't be bothered to remember.  The other details of the first episode escape me, and I vaguely recall being bored as I watched that episode.  The next few focus on the appearance of Titans within Wall Rose and the mysterious Beast Titan.  I can remember Sasha going off on a tangent at some point to visit her village by herself, which also bored me and I'm pretty sure I stopped paying attention.  Then a few of the kids from the 104th head out with some veterans to search for the hole in the wall, and they stop at the ruins of some castle.  They get attacked by a bunch of Titans, including the Beast Titan.  Ymir shifts for the first time onscreen there and then the action really kicks off.
In the next few episodes, Christa reveals her true name to Ymir and the audience, and Eren gets kidnapped by Bertolt and Reiner.  It's at this point where the story really gets going, and its pacing also picks up.  This fixes one of the issues I had with the first season.  In the first season, the 25-episode format covered three arcs.  Because of how long the first season was, the plot was stretched out beyond belief.  The anime didn't have to make the Battle of Trost arc and the Female Titan arc as long as it did, but that's what happened.  It left me bored and I felt like I wasn't even watching an anime at that point.  The second season only lasted for twelve episodes and only told one arc to completion, and because of that the second season didn't feel so bloated and stretched.
If you ask me, the most interesting part about Shingeki no Kyojin is its world.  All of the setpieces were there from the beginning to build an interesting setting, and I think Hajime Isayama did a great job at doing so.  He provides the audience with small bits information about the gritty, bleak landscape of Shingeki no Kyojin at calculated points in the series that leave the watcher wanting more so they keep coming back.
As always, the art and music were amazing.  There was a noticeable dip in the quality of the animation in some places, but the animators made up for it in other scenes.  There were a few scenes that were incredibly visually appealing and I don't think I'm going to forget about them for a while.  The visuals in this season's OP were great in many places.  The soundtrack was equally excellent, but there were a few issues.  The OP was okay, but I don't really understand Wit Studio's obsession with using Linked Horizon songs for all of the OPs.  Sure, the first two (Guren no Yumiya and Jiyuu no Tsubasa) were great, but the second season's OP (Shinzou wo Sasageyo!) failed to live up to its predecessors.  The EP was terrible and left a sour taste in my mouth when I listened to it.  It sounded like a blend of annoying vocals with a disgusting mishmash of all kinds of instruments that just didn't flow together well.
The characters were definitely the show's weak point.  Our protagonist, Eren, is annoying as always and still acts like a bumbling, shouting idiot.  All he seems to do is complain and scream incoherently before preaching to the characters about courage.  It's honestly rather annoying and I let out an audible groan every time he showed up onscreen.  The people of Shingeki no Kyojin act as if he's the most important person of all time, and while he certainly is important as an asset, he's not the most important thing in the world and I'm tired of the series acting like he is.  The season certainly suffered from this ever-present character, and so when the second season made the choice to not focus on him as much I was rather grateful.
But who does the attention fall to, if not to Eren?  None other than Eren's two best friends Mikasa and Armin.  Unfortunately, there isn't really much to say about these characters that isn't already present at face value.  Mikasa wants to protect Eren, and Armin is really smart.  Neither of these things are particularly interesting, but during the course of this season they grew on me for some reason that's unknown to me.  Other attention was placed on the other characters of the 104th, particularly Ymir, Christa/Historia, Reiner, and Bertolt, all of whom happen to be my favorite characters in the series.  Reiner and Bertolt were antagonists that I didn't really see coming.  There were signs before that would point to their true intentions, but I didn't really put much thought behind them until after their big reveal.  I could say the same thing about Ymir and Christa.  Ymir wasn't someone who I cared about at all until her big reveal, and Christa was being built up as an incredibly important character to the story's future narrative about halfway through the season.  Other characters, like Sasha, were entirely defined by a single character trait.  Sasha is constantly hungry, Connie is seemingly always angry (just like Eren), and I could keep going on and on if I wanted to.  The series doesn't do a very good job at developing its characters and it really likes to kill off random people.  Sometimes I really think that the characters are just straight up stupid, especially the random characters that are eaten by Titans that somehow snuck up on them.  Every time some Randy would get munched on by a Titan, the most of a reaction I could muster was a simple ""darn.""  All in all, I just don't really enjoy the presence or personality of most characters and the series could definitely do a better job at developing its wide cast.
I'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy this anime.  The action was nice to watch and a refreshing reprieve from the ugly and poorly done action that most other shows feature.  It's not as good as a lot of people say it is, and I'd say that it doesn't really deserve all the critical success it's receiving when there are shows that need it more, but its incredible success is understandable.  I'd say this is a six or seven out of ten, and it's definitely a notable step up from the bloated mess that the first season was.  I'll more than likely be watching the next season if only to further analyze the series.",7

                Am I still in time to jump on the sequel complain train to Titanville? Or do I have to take the next one to Owari Town?
Story:
Last time we ended right as we were watching Annie having a mental breakdown and retreating into her chrystal pokeball as well as the revelation that there are titans within the walls. Both these cliffhangers are abandoned very early on. Instead, season 2 decides to reveal more secrets to us in a way that is reminiscent of a horror mystery more than an action shounen. I enjoyed this change in direction, but some people did not and I can totally
                  understand that. This isn’t what you expected from Attack on Titan. The action picks up again in the latter half of the season though. It is not necessarily a bad thing for a show to keep its secrets for a while, but keeping them too long will make people lose interest and stop believing in an eventual reveal. As an ongoing manga, Attack on Titan doesn’t have that problem. But as an anime adaption, it certainly does. Before the third season was announced for next year, many people already decided to abandon the anime in favor of the manga or just abandon AoT in general. The sequel to one of the hottest shows ever took four years and delivered nothing to its hardcore fans but more open questions and less action. That shouldn’t have happened. But enough about what went wrong, let’s see what went right. As I mentioned before, the different approach at the whole story was much to my liking, as these titans are pretty terrifying creatures (as we learned already by now) and there are many secrets still hidden by and surrounding them. The big reveals were handled quite good as well, I especially loved the one case were possibly the biggest plot twist we had up to this point was casually revealed within some small talk. This may not sound like a good idea, but the way it was executed was hilariously clever. Provided we will finally get some answers in season 3, the second did a fine job of building up the suspense, but as I said, it may all be pointless if there is nothing at the end of the rainbow. In total, it was well done, but not in a way many expected it to, which may or may not be a bad idea.

Art.
Season 2 relied a lot more on CGI than the first one. At times, that looked pretty good, at other times, it didn’t. I don’t know why anime studios continuously fail to utilize CGI in an appealing way. I mean, they surely have the technical capabilities to do so, so why don’t they? There are positive examples of course, which only makes this stick out more. Other than that, the animation quality hasn’t changed much. Character and titan design still looks good, the titans might even look better than those of last season.
7/10
Sound:
When I heard the new opening, I immediately called it “lame”. Now that I heard it about two dozen times, I can safely say that I was a moron calling it that. It still has this epic feeling to it, but the buildup is slower. I still prefer the first two, but this is still up there with them. What I really liked a lot was the ending. While the others were solid choices for a shounen series, this one totally hits the tone and atmosphere of Attack on Titan. It’s a creepy, disturbing song, highlighted by the similarly eerie pictures of…well, I don’t know, it’s probably the history of creation of the titans or something. The soundtrack had the misfortune of not having many epic fights or scenes of destruction to underlay, but it was still very good. That one song they used in the final episode didn’t connect with me, but that was more because of other reasons I will shortly come to speak of.
9/10
Characters:
First of all, the amount of characters was much better to handle than in the previous season, as the cannon fodder has been dealt with already. Which brings me to a different point of criticism. At this point in time we know which characters have plot armor and who doesn’t. This was a big strength of the first season, as anybody could die at any time. To produce more victims for the titans we get a bunch of no-names introduced who are obviously walking death flags. Not that I didn’t like them, it just misses the impact of them getting brutally mutilated and eaten. Later on, they didn’t even try anymore and just had people getting killed the moment they appeared on screen. Not only that, they also died in pure slapstick, like that one guy who was eaten off his horse while talking. I can somewhat understand that you can’t keep killing of main (or bigger side) characters, but I’m not sure that this is the way to go. I disliked the fact that both Eren and Mikasa had absolutely no character development, in fact, they might even have regressed a little. At least, they felt like caricatures of themselves throughout this season, which was somewhat annoying. Thankfully however, the focus wasn’t on them most of the time. This was the season for the side characters to shine and they grabbed that brass ring wholeheartedly. Reiner, Ymir and Krista had the most focus, but Bertolt, Sasha and Connie also got their chances. It appears to me that Attack on Titan is still looking for a solid middle ground between all these extremities, but hasn’t yet found it.
7/10
Enjoyment:
Season 2 started out strong but kept stumbling along the way. I liked the approach, but it failed to leave an impact like the first season did. The danger of alienating its viewers is real, but it is yet to cross that line. Well, if you watched the first season you don’t need me to tell you whether or not this one is worth it, you will watch it anyway. Let me just warn you about having too high expectations before doing so. Despite all its flaws, it was still a good and enjoyable show, but I expect more out of it in season three.

"
Just before we begin i'd like to warn people that mature language WILL be used extensively throughout the review so brace yourselves.
Took me a while to watch this and for a very good reason.I want the hype dust to settle down and i also want some days off to see if my initial thoughts still hold up...And boy am i gonna get some shit for this review.
First off i think i have spotted a problem with anime in general in recent years and one that plagues this one as well.With such a huge number of animes every season you must ensure your creation will get
                  as much attention as possible and very quickly.That's more or less the reason you don't see animes 20 eps and over.Almost every anime has to do with 12 eps at best and in that space and time information,plot,characters have to be interesting and grab your full attention.
Now this wasn't the case with AoT.It had 25 eps to do the fucking job at hand.And you know what?As first seasons go it faired pretty well.But i think everyone,including the writers,forgot that a season 2 might be coming or they weren't even sure about a 2nd installment and tried their best only in the 1st one.The 1st one had many issues but as an overall experience it was bloody good.
Which brings me to this one.And i'm not gonna beat around the bush guys and gals.It's stupidly horrid.I think my ratings were very generous here.For starters while the 1st did a good job introducing us to this world and its' characters and all,focused too much on some characters and this was its' downfall.Cause come season 2 was time to focus on other characters......And oh boy..Oh boy indeed..The anime shifts focus faster than fucking electricity and onto characters i didn't even remember where in the anime and honestly couldn't give a shit about since in season 1 they were almost non existent.I wonder if they have ever heard of something called continuity..Guess not by the looks of things.
I honestly can't tell what was their endgame here.4 fucking years for 12 eps in total and that's the best they could come up with?Or maybe they were so blinded by the success of the 1st one,they thought they could afford a bad job this time and because they had 3rd one in the pocket they couldn't be bothered.
Look i get these characters play a huge role in the bigger scheme of things but bringing them in the spotlight out of the blue or in some cases for no apparent reason other than...Fuck off and give us your money you suckers..If only they spent some time in season 1 to pave the way for these characters,this season would make so much more sense.Or even better if they ACTUALLY made fucking use of this 4 long years to make it a 25 eps one...But they didn't...And that was the final nail in its' coffin.Too much time spent on characters that are crucial but you have no idea why,except if you read the manga.But i don't want to read the manga,i want to watch the anime that's why i'm here.
Also when you have established some characters as the main core don't push them aside for half the season.And what was with these fucking flashback moments every now and then?I swear i haven't seen so many flashbacks since the Bold and the Beautiful was airing in the 90's.
Yeah i like backstory too,who doesn't?But not in that way.Almost the entirety of this season was full of ""oh they're gonna eat me now,i'm gonna die"" and ""oh i'm gonna die here's some flashback to show you some scene which is supposed to be important but is or isn't at all""..That's fucking lazy.And lazy is the perfect word to summarise the writing in this season.
Apart from that we got to see the new Yeti-like titan whose intelligence is far above the rest of them.You could sit down and talk about existentialism with this guy.
But bad news keep on coming and this time it was the animation that got the treatment.No it wasn't all bad but it was those moments(and trust me there were many of them)where the use of some primitive CG was used.For example when they rode their horses they looked like fucking legos.I get CG saves time but come on,you made so much money off the 1st season you could afford to spend some more on 2d rather than this hideous thing that looked like a child's painting.And worst of all all those brilliant spidermanish moments now are almost gone and when we do get to see some action it feels so underwhelming it beggars belief.
Which brings me sadly to talk about the overall feel of the thing.The whole the world is about to end sense is nowhere to be found.Even with the new ape titan things just don't roll.Where's that sense of fear the first one had?
VA's did their part,not that they had much to do anyways since most of the anime was either searching a hole in the wall.As for songs....Not good,not good at all.
Now to end this,if you're a fanboy or fangirl this will be heaven on earth and you won't give a single fuck about anything i talked about.If you're not though you'll be very dissapointed.",5

                This was a great and well made second season of SnK! Only 12 episodes, Of course we want more!
But it was 12 episodes of build up: build up mysteries, build up questions, build up tension!! Now that I am reading the manga I totally understand why they only did 12 episodes, it makes total sense! 
Story: 10
A lot of things change, it's not just Eren and the rest of the soldiers fighting the titans and trying to restore the land they lost to them; now there's questions, doubts - what the hell are we actually fighting? - revelations, that are key to the plot and
                  take a while to digest, specially Ymir, Bertholt, Reiner (seriously, Oscar of best actors EVER!) and Christa!
There is a lot of tension while building up these plots and the deaths on the first episodes are just terrifying and gruesome. 
Art: 10
We all know how the Snk  art works - I have to say that my favourite part was [SPOILER ALERT]
when A**** turned to B******* and told them that A**** was being tortured in the inner walls, and that they were running away, abandoning a friend a companion. It was all bluffing ofc, but dude, that face... that face while saying it!!!
One thing I've noticed, now that I am reading the manga, is that, that from the manga to the anime, the art is even more intense; specially because in the manga you can see about 4 panels on a page so the transition is fast - in the anime there is those micro seconds before THE THING! and that's brilliant & amazing! 
Sound: 8 
Before the anime was released I was like ""please make a good opening; don't do it like they did with Tokyo Ghoul..."" SASAGEYO, SASAGEYO, SHINZOU WO SASAGEYO! duuuuuuude that was good! I know it's kinda recycled music or just the continuation of Jyuu no Tsubasa, but it fits perfectly, I don't feel betrayed like I felt on Tokyo Ghoul (seriously that second season op was really shitty!).
The ending - so many questions, such beautiful song!
Characters: 9
So much development - this was the season where we get some truths, but all those beg questions and bring doubts. 
We get to know a little more about side characters like Sasha and Connie, and my particular favourite was Ymir!
Enjoyment: 9
Just an advice: watching this week by week is so much better!! 
Overall: 9
It's really good!",9
"
                All before watching SNK 2 I was wondering if Wit Studio could pull off an upheaval after the disastrous Koutetsu no Kabaneri (just the thought of mentioning it gives me a shudder). Given the general hype the anime left people almost four years ago, the first season of Shingeki no Kyojin delivered a widespread following that it spurred a lot of assorted media-- novelty items (like an oppai mousepad of mikasa XD), doujinshi (most of them are BL anyway), cosplay, posts, forums, movies, spinoffs, a tribute game, a cult following, a subreddit and even memes, and whatnot. It was one anime I very much anticipated
                  to the point of being a nutjob about it. 
Shingeki no Kyojin starts where it ends in season 1, where yes, for those who haven't read the manga, what you've seen in the last part of the episode is true (although there was no build-up of surprise here). We are again thrown into this miserable world of titans, whose raison d'être is unclear aside from making humans unhappy by treating them as fish sticks or whatever. The first four episodes is investing in the mystery, and we are shown some of the side characters' side stories (there is no joke there). And with most of the characters not yet subjected into heavy action, they remain cardboard cutouts which demands very little of my attention, and I was wondering if there would even be an avenue for decent character build-up for them not to look like expandable, dull-edged characters. 
But other than that, seeing through the first four episodes of this anime, I felt something alien pervaded the atmosphere. The first season was gruesome, gritty and somewhat spine-chilling that I have to hunch over my shoulder just so to assure myself that there isn't a titan there with me in the room. The brutality of the atmosphere made this world in SNK real, and it was grueling sympathizing with the characters as they try to salvage humanity from the hands of these giant man-eaters. But this season it felt like they are trying to be intentional with that atmosphere. Considering that the first parts of this season is a lull (ironically) to the series as if they were just stocking up before a big storm. But I cannot shake off the feeling that something is not right with the delivery. The horror here is starting to... ""neutralize"" that I could even watch this straight without feeling anything. There is also unwanted drama that I did not sign for, like a tawdry addition to make it seem like Wit is even trying. I can forgive when an anime delivers a low impact, but not when it gives me less than expected.
And I just wasn't into it. Actually after watching episode 2, I felt as if I wasn't interested on watching episode 3 and went on watching another anime on the Spring 2017 lineup. If this keeps up I might lose interest entirely, shame for all the anticipation I had in this. Or maybe it was just me, since on season 1 I piled the episodes so I would have a continuous feel-trip whereas I was watching this per week, but I hope they would try to keep up a decent pace since they will only be giving 12 episodes; and I really pray they don't level down to the ranks of Shokugeki no Souma Ni no Sara where everything became flat and rushed.
You might feel I was giving a lot of negatives, but this anime surely is still good enough to watch. I mean, there is a lot more to say for the next episodes, and with Wit Studio's foray to make this anime as more of a hit like the first season, I could still very much keep my butt glued to my seat for the incoming episodes.",7
"
                Although some problems - not of production, because technically the anime was above the average - of choices, like, for example, the use of CG in some occasions and, especially, the use of him in the Colossal Titan, the anime itself It went well. Taking away these little bad choices. The director throughout this season has been to me moderately well. His direction was to let the work follow its natural linearity, as in the manga. Some emotional strengths could have been more explored, if in case the chief executive wanted to, but even so, the voice actors did a perfect job for themselves. Apart
                  from some poor technical choices, I would say that this season followed without major problems, and ended decently.",10
"
                I highly enjoyed the first season of AoT -- I felt it started stronger than it finished but it was still quite good.
I was looking forward to the second season, but it felt lacking most of the time. Some plot twists were interesting, but could've been executed better. I didn't remember half the characters from the first season (to my own fault), so some of their interactions left me feel a bit out of the loop. There were a few engaging scenes, particularly the fight sequences, and I'm a fan of the art style as ever. Hype intro song.
Overall the main issue is that I
                  just felt very little attachment to anything going on in the story; characters had iffy motives that I couldn't really sympathize with. It wasn't quite the ""pageturner"" that the first season was. Wasn't worth the wait. :P Though I'm still invested enough to watch the eventual Season 3, you could say I wasn't a GIANT fan of season 2. :P",4

                Shingeki no Kyojin (Season 2) 
Directors: Tetsurou Araki, Masashi Koizuka 
Written by: Yasuko Kobayashi 
Music by: Hiroyuki Sawano 
Based on: Manga (Volumes 9-12) 
Creator: Hajime Isayama 
Story (8/10): I talked a lot about the story for my review of season 1 of Attack on Titan. My thoughts for the second season are exactly the same. Shingeki no Kyojin uses a cliche plot concept and makes it anything but cliche. 
Art (9/10): The art is fantastic and is one of the main reasons why I prefer the anime of Attack on Titan over its original manga. WIT Studio did a fantastic job. 
Sound (10/10): The music is outstanding. Hiroyuki Sawano is back with a mesmorizing OST that you'll be sure to remember for years to come. 
Characters (9/10): The characters are fantastic. from Eren Yeager's determination, Mikasa's loyalty, Armin's intelligence, Jean's stubbornness, and Levi's sarcasm. However, what definitely makes the characters amazing is what happens to Ymir, Reiner, Berthholdt, Marco, and Miche Zacharius. 
(I won't spoil what happens to those who haven't watched this series yet.) 
Enjoyment (9/10): I love Attack on Titan; one of the best newer anime that I have watched. 
Overall (9/10): While having some minor flaws, Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2 (Attack on Titan Season 2) is a fantastic classic anime series with excellent music, visuals, characters, and of course, action and gore. One of the best anime of the decade. Highly recommended.",9

                While the attention to Levi is drawn away as a result of his injury, the second season puts much more emphasis on the other characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the this season compared to the first, despite initially hoping to see more Levi action. Unlike the first season which seemed like a repetitive cycle of character building then killing them off, the second focuses on tactics, and moments of suspense which are timed incredibly well. Each episode is left on a crucial cliffhanger which leaves viewers anticipating the next decision a character will take and these are often very unpredictable due to the nature of the
                  plot twists. Furthermore, there is much more development of many supporting characters - not the least Connie, Sasha, Ymir - and we get to see them interact in a different way. Additionally the quality of sound and animation is just as impressive as that of the first season if not better, making Season 2 of Attack on Titan one of my favorite series to date.",9
"
                Looking for a solid action anime to watch? Right here. Undeniable one of the best crafted action anime's to date. Carrying on from the first season AOT S2 had my fully fledged attention from beginning to end of every episode even some of the less action filled ones. The plot although as far as post apocalyptic story lines go isn't very intricate, there has yet to be another anime plotline that has filled me with so much wonder, intrigue, and awe. The second season in my opinion capitalized so well with it's OST and their actions scenes that they had me up and out of
                  my seat in excitement several times during this series. Although the second season doesn't seem to have as much 'meat' as the first, mainly due to it's 12 episode handicap, it is obvious to see where the writers were planning on bringing the audience if they had a 24 episode budget. I hope to see more from them in the near future!",9
"
                The review is mostly identical to season 1:
Art 10/10: Beautiful background, bad-ass actions and nice close-in shots to show characters' emotions. As good as you can get right now. 
Sound 10/10: Great voice acting and sound effect. Amazing sound track that compliment the story
Character 10/10: Diverse range of real characters. Even more character development in season 2 that make them deeper.
Story 9/10: Great story with a lot of twists while making sense. Climax in many episodes. -1 for being sloppy in the 2nd half of the season. Enjoyment 10/10: I couldn't stop watching. Enjoy the whole thing from start to finish.
 In my own rating system, a perfect show gets 9/10. If a show strikes me hard emotionally or teach me something that change my life, then it goes another +1. This is a perfect show, 9/10",9
"
                I'm just going to make this quick because so many other people have reviewed this but pretty much what I have to say is, Attack on Titan season 2 was good, but not waiting for 4 years good.
Even though I enjoyed Kabeneri of the Iron Fortress, I would have much rather have had that project canceled for a full 24-ep season of AOT.
There's some things it maintains really well like the art and animation, absolutely gorgeous and amazing. But others not so much, after soon finding out about the beast titan, you want to get right into it, but the anime kinda delays it and
                  sets aside for more character development which is ok, just in the wrong moment. Also some other things that are ""revealed"" and other such are not done well, (If you watch it you'll see what I mean)
But overall, still brilliant in many aspects and worth the watch.
Also I just wanted to talk about the ED of the anime, its....creepy.
It reminded me if a child that was mentally scarred by the titans wrote the song and drew the pictures, its..not pleasant.
Anyway, thanks for reading!

                I do think it is disappointing that the four year gap between seasons made Attack on Titan lose its initial hype, especially when this season is different, and at the same time, better than the first season. Attack on Titan is a series that continually improves with time, and Season 2 is a prime example of that.
The pacing of Season 2 is slower, and the more action-packed moments are replaced with quieter moments where we get to see more character development, especially in certain characters we did not have the pleasure to get to know as well in Season 1. I found that the season
                  initially started a bit slow, but once Episode 5 hit, and then the amazing Episode 6, the season only went upward from there. The second season builds off the mysteries of the first, creating a thrilling and suspenseful twelve episode season. Getting to look at new characters like Reiner, Bertholdt, Ymir, and Historia is another add-on to this season, as these were the characters we did not get to know as well in Season 1, yet they become of vital importance in this season.
I think the animation has definitely improved in this season (besides CGI Colossal Titan), and there are some shots in this season that are breathtaking. Sawano continues to deliver an amazing score, and the voice actors do a phenomenal job.
I suppose if there are any true downsides to this season, it is, as I said, that the pacing is slower and that there is less action and less of that horror element we witnessed in the first season. There is one episode near the end of the season where our characters are simply just talking, and while it was difficult to sit through that episode when watching week to week, that episode is still necessary in terms of laying out the framework of Attack on Titan's world and the mysteries behind it.
Though shorter than Season 1, Attack on Titan Season 2, aka ""The Clash of the Titans"" arc combines all the elements of what made the first season great and improves on the first season with more time for character development and worldbuilding. It is still one of my favorite arcs of the franchise. This was the season that encouraged me to read the manga because I was so desperate to learn more, and I think that is something to give the season credit for.",10
"
                Attack On Titan S2 was a tide breaker, and revealed some insane truth behind the titans origins.
It's hard not to write spoilers, and I'll try to be as vague as possible, but a LOT happens in this season for only twelve episodes. It follows what the first season left us as Eren and his friends try to find out what the truth really is, and this season really shows some major truth.
Sound and art were great, and possibly even better in the art department. The OP wasn't as good as the first season, but it was definitely hype! Also the dubbed version was again, amazing!
I
                  gotta admit, this show is just getting better and I can see season 3 being an insane ride already. The characters had more backstory to follow, and we didn't see many new characters, but we did see two characters that were very interesting, but didn't get too much screen time.
Overall this one is definitely worth the watch! Season one was great, but this one had me on my seat almost every minute. Highly recommend!",8
"
                What a season! Shingeki no Kyojin's first season is one of my favorite animes of all time, and i'm so glad this second season maintained its greatness, even surpassed in some parts.
Story (10)
In terms of story, it continued directly from where the 1st season ended. As a traddition of SnK, a lot of mysteries... But the truth about the titans and the walls is becoming more and more clear, finally! Yet, it's one of the more innovative stories i have ever seen. So, it's great!
Art (9)
Yes, i think most people won't agree with me in this. It's animation, God, it's perfect, it's all so fluid!
                  The action scenes are all so well'animated, turning it very fun to watch. My problem with the art is just its design, but, then, it comes from the original material (manga), and so, i don't like it very much. But the fluid animation kind of compensates it.
Sound (10)
This is maybe the best thing about SnK. The OST is so great! All the best scenes have an extra degree of greatness because of it. There's nothing else to say about it...
Character (9)
Some of my favorite characters of all time are Rivaille and Mikasa. All of the characters here have a background and a motivation for their acts, they are not just thrown at our faces, you know, and that's one of the best things in SnK, in my opinion. But still, i think some characters weren't used in their all potential. And that's not a fault of the season, it's just that in this arc it follows these characters don't appear enough. So, i understand, but it bothered me anyway.
Enjoyment (10)
Not many things to say here. Just that Shingeki no Kyojin is so fun to watch! Recommend it to everyone!!

                Real Score:8\10
Shingeki no Kyojin finally returns to our TV Screens after 4 years from the last episode, and it returns in spectacular fashion, improving in almost every way possible from the last season, from the tone to the Balance between Action and Dialogue\Story
Story 7.5
The Story is approached in a more serious way, becoming almost an horror mistery, with the mistery obviously being the Titans. It reaches a good balance between Action, Exposition and Character development;this balance isn't perfect though, due to a great number of flashbacks that kill the rhytm of the story sometimes. The continuing increase of the ""Titan's secret"" and the possibility that
                  a secret organization amongst humans could be the responsible for all of this sets the premise for a further evolution of what started as a really basic story of survival and fights. The Slower pace that upsetted a lot of fans was what the series needed, an insane rollercoaster of emotions and twists isn't bad, but if repeated could seriously hurt the entire series on the long run
Characters 7
Another step towards the good way that the season took is in how the characters were handled. They have a lot more time to develop and we have a lot more time to get attached to them, the flashbacks, though annoying at times, serve to reveal parts of the characters that we didn't know and that could make them interesting: A prime example of it is the Ymir and Christa situation, which had a really unexpected turn and actually made me care about both of the characters, which i never cared about
But it's not flawless, cheap dialogue, dumb moments and not-so-well written characters with almost no growth remain(I'm looking at you Armin), and the Main Trio continues to be uninteresting, there needs to be a turning point somewhere in the future, if not, having a Boring Main Trio could make everyone lose interest in the series
Sound 9
Aot(or SNK) continues to have one of the best, if not the best soundtrack, of recent years, every beat is spot on, it has a really good variety throughout the entire Show and the OST are amongst the most entertaining and catchy of recent years
The new opening is fantastic, as usual, it doesn't matter if it's better than the other 2, just enjoy the fact that we, in 37 episodes, had 3 amazing openings that we'll remember for a long time
Animation and Direction 8.75
Studio WIT really knows how to handle frames and animation constantly and in the best ways possible. Maybe the best part is not the improved frames, designs or looks, but the fact that there's no drastic change from the previous Season, it looks like a direct sequel to the first one.Some Drawings in some of the frames look a bit chunky and some ""moments"" are clearly with no substance whatsoever, but the direction stands out in almost every moment, every cut has  intense emotion, strong meaning and the Light\Dark contrast adds so much to every scene
Enjoyment 8.5
I enjoyed this far more than i expected, not because i like slow-paced shows, but because i simply enjoy character growth, development and a story well-told and well-written, shame that the characters annoyed me at times and some of the flashbacks really killed the mood sometimes.I didn't mind the fights either, i'm a big fan of well-thought action scenes, and some of them are almost perfect from a tecnical and practical standpoint. I enojoyed the growth of specific characters (Ymir and Christa in particular) and the thrilling mistery overflowing around the Titans was captivating and i can't wait to know more.Special mention to the Titans finally being finally terrifying again, and with the Beast Titan being the big bad Titan we all wanted
In the end, Attack on Titan Season 2 is an improvement in almost every aspect, and a good turning point for a franchise that was starting to become stale and repetitive, the horror\mistery route has really helped and there's a really good chance for further improvement, i believe that this may be a solid stard for an ulterior improvement in the Aot(or SNK) Franchise and i'm hopeful for any future work
Thanks for reading this review, May our Sweet and Merciful Madoka be with you and have a nice SASAGEYO day everyone",8
"
                First off, let me say, I'm not ripping on the second because it ""didn't live up"". The review is simply based on the overall, actual mechanics and execution which I felt was extremely poor; especially compared to the first season. I was a huge fan of the first season, mainly because the production was of such high quality. Regarding the second season, that quality simply isn't there. I will explain in detail in each subsection while keeping it spoiler free.
Story:
The first half of season 2 has no consistent sense of time; the narrative jumps all over the place leaving the viewer confused and agitated. Essentially,
                  I felt like the beginning half was just a series of subplots stitched together haphazardly. I have never felt more agitated and irritated watching an anime. The root cause of this agitation was simply because the narrative refuses to give you any relief of anticipation. It just keeps building tension and more tension without giving the viewer any release or even any expectation of a release. After about the halfway point, the plot finally starts unfolding but honestly, not even in an interesting way. Literally, the least interesting way possible (you'll know what I mean). As a result, it felt like the action sequences had no sense of purpose anymore. Also, any sense of character unity that was prevalent in the first season starts crumbling apart. In short, the second season has some serious pacing problems coupled with uninteresting plot development. It's like the writers were trying to make the plot interesting by artificially injecting a sense of anticipation and the result is just a viewer who gets let down.
Art:
Given the spectacular art in the first season, I did NOT think the second season would pull some of the s*!t it did. Excessive use 3D models with terrible motion on top of it. Dark, muddled environments gave it a medieval look... but honestly, RuneScape did it better.
Parts of the anime are gorgeous while other parts look worse than a video game from the late 1990s. The colossal titan was modeled and animated fully in 3D at one point and it looked terrible; my jaw dropped. This is not even close to the same quality of art as in the first season. The 2D art maintained its look but I could see that they did their best to cut corners. Less landscapes, less close ups, less color contrast and just less complex 2D animation overall. Towards the end of the season, that began to change but for 3/4ths of the season it's pretty obvious.
Sound:
This is the one area that kept up well and probably actually outperformed the first season in my honest opinion. The beautiful piano etudes during emotional (and action) scenes, the clever use of shepard tones to build tension and anticipation during down time, the music kicking in right at the perfect moment of action; the type that gives you goose bumps. Attack on Titan 2's music and sound team pulled off a great feat and honestly, it's one of the only reasons it kept this anime in the ""epic"" category for me.
Character:
As I mentioned in the story part above, the one of the biggest downfalls in the plot is the lack of character unity and character purpose. Only a few supporting characters really get developed while the rest are forgotten about and get barely any screen time. The whole aspect of a character using their ""cleverness"" or ""what makes them unique"" is thrown away for a titan brawling s%^t-show. It's the same trap that many shonen series find themselves in as their plots progress. It goes from being ""weak character(s) using clever, interesting solutions"" to ""ridiculous OP characters using raw power and all the useless, supporting characters watching in awe"".
Enjoyment:
I enjoyed watching it. I wasn't particularly upset with the overall plot. I just wasn't expecting the series to turn out the way it did and it didn't have the same animation and story telling quality I was expecting from the first season.
Overall:
Fun to watch and glad to get more of the story. It has it's disappointments being plagued with pacing problems, bad art direction, and lackluster character development. It it makes up for it with the epic nature of the plot and with some seriously fantastic sound and music design/execution. As such, i'll give it an overall rating of 4 (Decent).",4
"
                For LA, the first season of Shingeki no Kyojin was decent and yes LA fell into the hype train but easily fell out of it and after FOUR YEARS it's second season arrived and LA was ecstatic to finally see if this second season would answer the questions that the first season left unanswered for so long....so did it?.
LA will get right to point with this second season and LA will say it definitely improved in certain areas the first season lacked, such as looking at dismissed and overlooked characters giving them something of a thread to the plot of the Titans and the Walls,
                  certain characters like Connie, Sasha, Krista and Ymir are certain examples...especially Ymir and Krista with their massive character developments and motivations in the chaos that was to come in this second season. Another massive boost to this second season is that it allowed the world of Shingeki no Kyojin to blossom with new mysteries coming into play that have ties to the major plotline this season, the most obvious being the Beast Titan and his plans in all this and finally, the most obvious one of the bunch and LA's aforementioned question, this second season finally itched LA's 4 year mystery of who the Colossal and Armoured Titans are in one of the most explosive yet nonchalant open plot twists  to arrive for Spring 2017.
In terms of characters and to be more precise character growth, as LA already said that side characters that were glanced at in the first season are finally given more context and focus but what about Eren, Armin and Mikasa?...well yes they have a stake in the story, typical of a the three main characters that have a narrative stake in the plot and all but with them taking a backseat and giving the side characters a chance to shine AND THEY DO SHINE this season, it gives us both character growth from the cast as well as developing the world and lore of the Titans simultaneously. LA would like to mention that LA didn't really have a favourite character from Shingeki no Kyojin (yes not even fan favourite Mikasa or Levi) but with this second season quite honestly LA would pick Krista as LA's favourite all from her involvement in this second season and her mysterious importance of it all.
Shingeki no Kyojin's second season's atmosphere also seemed to have changed...slightly, not only is this obvious from the director change from Tetsuro Araki (as he likes to be bombastic and intense with his atmosphere) to Masashi Koizuka (associate director of Owari no Seraph) giving off a more grim dark and mysterious atmosphere to it all as well as having all the intensity and bombastic chaos to it all (yeah...Tetsuro Araki is still CHIEF Director so that explains that), from Titans being abominations to laughing stock crazy giant people to moodwhiplashing us to show that they are terrifying again (well some of them) to even more gruesome deaths at the hands of the Titans, this second season does run with this atmosphere for nearly the entirety of it run and then some.
For animation done once again by WIT Studio's, the animation is expected of WIT Studio's and it's biggest hit bringing in the expected detail and charm it had from it's previous season. The battles were again some of the highlights of the anime but another aspect of the animation comes from it's more grim dark deaths and it's uncensorship of it made it all the more great in saying that this second season IS serious in what it's showing us, another point is the beautiful and gorgeous background work done in this second season, what with this second season mostly taking place outside the walls (and the walls itself), the scenery is diverse and just beautiful. You know what LA is gonna say and it's expected animation from WIT Studio's and they pulled it off.
 Voice work for this second season was actually very well done and although the majority of the voice cast did excellent in this season LA does have a certain voice actor LA would praise throughout this season and that would go to Saki Fujita as Ymir, not only for her playing against the type character but for her simply giving much more range of emotions that the other voice actors just didn't go through (yes Hiro Shinono as Connie is one but his range is more in the terrified and paranoid sector, Saki on the other hand went through MUCH more).
So as much as LA is praising the hell out of this second season was there any faults that irked LA?, well nothing's perfect and LA would say that although the massive shift of character focus from Eren and his gang to the side characters is something LA wanted to see, the small problem with this is that due to the side characters getting more focus, certain focused side characters will become suspicious thus be predictable but LA will easily defend this complaint by saying that looking at different characters is a more of breath of fresh air away from the shouting vengeful main character (not to mention again...developing the lore of the world and it's Titans by shifting focus away from our main leads). The only other problem is that since this is only 12 episodes long not EVERY answer (new or old) won't be answered in this second season but that complaint is easily rectified (hopefully) by it's announced 3rd season in 2018.
 So with all this, is this LA's favourite anime of Spring 2017?...no but it's definitely in the Top 3 for LA and probably the second best in terms of sequels. The second season of Shingeki no Kyojin definitely rectified certain faults such as answering 4 year old mysteries, massive character growth and advancing the plot to new heights that the first season couldn't to the point of bringing back not only the hype train but LA's interest in this series again and even when this second season having faults of it's own, it still had lots of defense to it to make LA ignore it beyond a shadow of a doubt what with LA's own newfound interest in the series again (mainly the mysteries of course and certain interesting characters). Even if this second season is only 12 episodes long, this is how you do a second season and LA hopes that the third season does the same but even better!",9
"
                **This review contain mid-heavy spoilers**
this is easily the worst season and arc, welli guess i'm late to party. 
The 1st half plot is nonsensical, although we got a twist like jaw titan and more backstory, these characters arent developed yet, but they get a backstory instead and all of the ""twist"" Doesn't make sense whatsoever, itsall complete deus ex machina and plot armor, it feels like they recycle the s1 non existent plot and recycle it
The animation and sound? Check, no questions asked, wit studio is based and redpilled
The characters are the worst part, after the armored titan reveal,ymir make a stupid decision, why she
                  didn't join the survey corps instead? Atleast she can be useful for humanity, and don't forget eren, he become plot device after reveal of armored titan for over 2-3 episodes, why hannes just didn't aim for the neck instead? When fighting the smiling titan that kill eren mother? The potential is wasted, but maybe for makes it extra drama i g
Thanks for reading!",6
"
                I'll apologize in advance for any possible grammar, punctuation or wording mistakes, English is my third language and on top of that, this is my first review.
Probably not going to involve myself much in reviews but SnK is an exception (there are some other titles that I might have ""reviewed"" as well but I only started using MAL recently despite my account being almost 3 years old, so there is that as well)
Disclaimer: I ll be assuming that you know more or less what the story is about (reading the synopsis should be enough) and that you have watched S1 so there might be some
                  minor season 1 spoilers ahead.
**Story  10/10**
You can't talk about a second season without bringing the first one so beware, some minor season 1 (or maybe major) spoilers ahead but rest assured no spoilers on the second season here.
To be honest, when I first started SnK (season 1) I was skeptical, it was just another over-hyped shonen with giant naked human-eating beasts A.K.A. Titans as the antagonists and 3 generic main protagonists all together in a generic survival plot.
Nothing special, nothing unique, nothing original.
But the show proved me wrong soon enough, the story was much more complex than i thought it would be, it was deeper, darker, more interesting. Every time they answer a question, they raise 10 more unanswered questions. Every time you think you understood something, they prove you wrong with an unexpected twist. And thus the cycle remains each and every time, which is a good thing in SnK.
**Art 9/10**
I ll skip this part since I am not fit to talk about 'art'.
Nothing to complain about here, while not at the level of.... let's say Fate stay night:UBW or Shingeki no Bahamut, it is still a solid 9.
**Sound 10/10**
The composer is Sawano Hiroyuki, should suffice as an explanation
**character 9/10**
All the characters (most of them at least) have their own unique backstory, personality and such, and even if they don't reveal their story you will somehow get attached to them through their interactions with other characters and love them (Levi squad, I am looking at you, Petra particularly rest in peace).
The minus 1 though is because of Eren in almost 2 seasons he didn't mature at all, still the same guy we got introduced to in episode 1 of season 1 after his mother got eaten.
**overall enjoyment 10/10**
Outstanding story with an outstanding OST (op and ed are great as well, never skipped them) with great characters delivered through great animation. 
10/10 would watch again",10
"
                This anime is brilliant. It deserves all the praise it gets. The storytelling is sharp. The characters are just as complex, dynamic, and believable as they were before. The opening for this season is a lot better for me than the first. The art style remains distinct and a trademark for this anime. It seems like the quality of the show was kept intact. If Attack on Titian excels in anything, it's the ability to entertain you and probe deep inside your psyche to ask yourself; would you do what they're doing if you were in their situation? It tells you that things are never
                  black or white. Good or evil. It's simply just people with different motivations and reasons doing what they have to do, to survive, no matter what it takes. I like that. The finale was definitely the best episode and left off leaving me wanting more. Season 3, you're next!",9
"
                Attack on Titan season 2, whether you're a fan of the franchise or not, is a high quality piece of work. Not only was the music impactful and memorable, but the art was absolutely stunning, very beyond what I would've known anime to be capable of.If there is even one complaint I would have to make of it, it would be the use of CGI. Now, I understand that drawing titans would obviously take a lot of work, so I'll let that slide, but sometimes the use of CGI in the backgrounds was slightly off putting for me (though it did provide with better camera
                  rotations). I don't understand why people would avoid such a great show for mainstream reasons, I mean, theirs a reason for it being 'mainstream'. It is definitely the result of something that been worked on for 4 years, and a masterpiece in creation in my opinion.",9
"
                After so many years, the company releases the second season. Is it the classic case of focusing more on the income and not on the product leaving the anime to some monkey animators? Does it get even better than season 1 because they had all this time to work on it? I don't think it's either of these, but what I can say is that I think each episode was extremely enjoyable to watch.
There are a few questions from the previous season that were answered in S2, but many more new questions brought up which I like. Character development is a little cliché, but it
                  seems to be a tactic for animes that contain a lot of characters to make it easier to remember. That said, it still took away from the experience knowing that acting a certain way was unrealistic. 
The plot is anew from the previous season and it jumps straight into it. There was a lot of *great* action scenes, and the ""6 hours earlier"" stuff was a cool and unique approach that isn't done often with other pieces and often fails.
If you're an anime lover who only follows a couple of on-going series (like me), Attack on Titan would be a great addition to that list.",10
"
                This anime... The best that I could describe it is just that it's shocking. The fighting, the mystery of the titans and everything else. 
The visuals are gorgeous and stylized as well, I really like this kind of style. The animation was smooth in most cases and very well done. 
While I have seen better characters, the story, the whole mystery and the visuals are definitely the primary selling points of this show.
When it comes to sound and music, that is among the best if not the best that I've heard so far as of writing this review.
I can wholeheartedly recommend this anime to anyone
                  who can stomach the blood gore and certain shocking scenes that the anime throws at the viewer at times.
It is an amazing anime whose creators can be proud of. Can't wait for the 3rd season!!!",9
"
                Four years.  Four years ago at the time of this review, the anime community was graced with Shingeki no Kyojin, an anime that had so much hype and attention revolving around it that even those that weren’t in the anime community were caught in its momentum.  With its long-awaited season two now finally here and at an end, was the wait worth it?  If you ask me, yes…and no.
Story:  Continuing right after the rampage of the female titan had come to an end (spoiler btw, not like almost everyone hasn’t already watched season one), Attack on Titan season two continues the
                  story of humanity’s struggle against the giant, stupid, naked men that eat humans for shits and giggles called titans.  Shorthanded, that’s the rough idea of what this season two is.  In actuality though, that’s about as off as one could explain what season two is.  
Comparatively, season two has a drastic shift in tone and pacing that makes the series more than the parodied action scenes and shock value of cannon fodder dying by titans that season one bountifully gave us.  We’re given less action and less titan murdering, but all of that is sacrificed for what I would consider as better suspense, better pacing, and overall a better presentation of the story.  While yes the series was only given 12 episodes to fulfill the portion of the ongoing war against titans, the time that it was given was if you ask me, a lot better spent and actually made me give a crap by a majority of what we’re being shown.
The main attributer to this would be not only the story shying away from the action, but more on the focus on characterization.  The meme/side characters of the series are given their time in the spotlight while the main trio is pushed to the side.  As a result of this, the show dives more into the characters of each member of the trainees that the main characters grew to know before becoming soldiers.  While your mileage will vary on the time and effectiveness of each story, as the short run time and focus doesn’t give everyone equal time in the limelight, this change not only provides the audience with characterization for some of the characters that we never got to really know, but also allowed the world to expand ever so slightly from the two areas within the wall that the first couple arcs were so heavily centered upon.  (Seriously though.  Trost was what, nine episodes?)
If anything, the only problem that I can see is that the show is just too short, especially for those who have been waiting.  As good as it is, one cour after four years is far less than ideal for what have been literal years after the hype it had before had died down and into only a fraction of its former glory.  It’s a bit of a shame, especially when this section of the story really begins to pick up more on what the fantasy of Shingeki no Kyojin can create. 
The ending is more or less a reflection of the ending of season one.  Recollection of all of the events of the season before ending on a cliffhanger giving the audience chilling shots further of what is to come.  It's not the best way to end the season, but at the very least, there's a season 3 on the way, so the audience isn't going to be left in the wringer.  
Overall, season two was a solid anime that had done away with a majority of the flaws that season one had.  Not to say it didn’t have its own set of problems, as some of the intentionally vague storytelling ended up being really annoying and the runtime of the series is quite short.  Despite that, season two is a definite improvement over season one, and if season three is a possibility, I hope to see it continue onward from there.
Overview:
+ Much better storytelling
+ More focused characterization
+ Better Pacing
-  Characterization wasn’t spread evenly
-  Several, annoying vague details
Characters:  As mentioned before, the characters in season two have a huge shift in both relevancy and importance.  The main trio act more as background characters in this season, and it is quite honestly one of the biggest positives in the series, as we’re no longer subjected to hearing Eren scream ‘TITAN’ for twenty plus episodes straight.
First on the chopping block is Ymir, a background character that really didn’t get that much relevance or even screentime in the first season.  Showing up mostly only during the trainee arc in the first season, Ymir becomes a more fleshed out character as the show unveils more of who she is and gives us a different view to people affected by the titan outbreak and the like.  The only problem is how vague the series makes Ymir.  Her backstory is almost comprised of flashbacks, and this is the section of the storytelling that irks me.  The series presents her struggle and how she got to the point to where she is now in such vague detail that for those like me who’ve only watched the anime, the show might as well not put in the effort to try.   Sure you can connect several dots, but when the show actively tries to hide so much information from you like it’s a playground secret, then you know you’re doing something wrong.  As a result, Ymir’s potential faltered and a lot of her supposed conflict was muted from what it could be.
Then there’s Christa.  Presented as a cute, pretty girl in the first season who wanted to give herself a little more meaning to her life, Christa has the opposite treatment to Ymir.  Her problems are presented in more detail (though it is smaller in scale), and we get a better sense to what she wants and what she fights for.  But the main problem is how the series makes Ymir a crutch for her to stand up straight.  While Ymir can stand by herself as her own character, Christa on the other hand needs Ymir to give her a majority of her characterization, and it’s slightly disappointing seeing the direction that they went with on how to develop her character.
Similarly, the rest of the ‘side cast’ including Conny, Sasha, Reiner, and Bertholdt follow suit as each of them are given time to explain and express what their part is in the overall scope of the series.  Conny and Sasha are much smaller, but give us rounded conciseness with that works well in their devoted episodes while Reiner and Bertholdt gives us larger stories that build up the world even more.  Also Eren and the lot are still there.  They’re not there for very long, but they still play a healthier role in the series that even if it's smaller, it's something that I'm personally fine with.
Overall, with what can only be described as a role reversal to the series as the side characters take the MCs’ places in the spotlight, characters that we previously knew very little about are given the time of day, creating what I believe to be a very welcome change.  It’s nice seeing that Sasha is more than just a ‘potato girl’.   
Overall:
+ Given side cast devoted characterization
+ A healthy dose of MC’s rather than an overdose
-  Main ‘focused’ characters still have lacking qualities
Art: Reprised by Wit Studio, the art for season two is…pretty much the same as season one.  The big difference however is the lack of the thick outline that the characters had in a majority of the earlier episodes in season one.  As a result, the characters look more melded with the background and don’t stand out as something separate to the background.  
Another positive change is the fact that the show puts in many more gruesome, suspenseful, and truly fearful moments that we get in the first episode of the first season.  The titans comparatively don’t ALWAYS look like bumbling idiots, and the art direction for the series has made them not only scary again, but something that would make sense for humanity to be fighting against to preserve their existence.  
The only real downside to all of this is the lack of flashy, fluid animation for the fight scenes.  No more cool and edgy 3-D maneuver gear shots, no more spinning Levi, etc, etc.  Personally, I don’t really mind since inputting that into the series would’ve created a jarring tonal shift, but the fluidity and proficiency that the survey corps was able to execute with the dual bladed spiderman gear was something that stood out to me in season one.  
Overview:
+ Pretty much the same art (with some slight improvements)
+ More built around suspenseful art direction 
+/-  Lack of flashy fight scenes (which at the end of the day doesn’t matter THAT much)
Sound: It’s…pretty much the same thing.  Just like the art, the sound for the series is pretty much the same thing as what season one provided.  Background music is roughly the same, and the new OP, ‘Shinzou no Sasageyo’ is a patriotic homage to the first opening that barely anyone can sing sans the word ‘Jaeger’.  Hell, it even has what sounds like to be a remix of the first OP in it in the latter half of the song.  
On the flipside, we have its ED, ‘Yuugure no Tori’, an…unsettling song complete with bad Engrish sung in a woman dubbed over with malfunctioning autotune.  It’s certainly unique, and memorable, but is so grating on the ears that I can’t stand it and I’m forced to skip it every episode because I value what little of my hearing I have left.  
Overview:
+ Pretty much the same soundtrack (including OP in a way)
+/- Very…interesting ED.  (Apparently there’re some that really like it.  I’m not one of those people.)
Personal Enjoyment: I never really considered Attack on Titan to have much, if any, worth.  Due to the tempest of hype that swirled around season one that spawned hundreds upon thousands of memes and unsettling fan creations, it became something I hated simply because it was shoved in my face so often, which didn’t really help my opinion of the series since I already thought it wasn’t anything too special once I got past the initial episodes.  Why am I explaining this?  Well that’s because season two was something I actually enjoyed.  It was more on the characters more than the action, and it focused more on the scope of the world rather than making cool edgy shots of the 3-D gear.  As hesitant as I am to give praise to this series (as extremely hyped shows tend to make me lean towards giving them a bad rap), I genuinely liked it.
What did I like about this series?
In terms of specifics, I liked how the main characters became much more muted versions of themselves.  Armin wasn’t solving everyone’s problem, Mikasa wasn’t as Eren-crazy, and Eren was a hell of a lot less shouty than he’s been in the past.  If we get more of this, I would be happy to finally give them the time of day.
What didn’t I like about the series?
Vagueness.  I hate series’ that intentionally make things hard to understand for the audience, and Ymir’s story is a prime example of that.  The flashbacks used to explain who she was never gave a setting, an explanation to what was happening, or even much as to why she acts the way she does beyond ‘doing it for Christa’.  It’s infuriating, and it withdraws sympathy from me since I only have a small inkling of an idea as to who or what she was before the events of the series.  Also the ending for the last fight was a bit of a cop-out.  Not really a fan of that particular bit.
Would I recommend this series?  
If you watched Attack on Titan season 1, and liked it, then watch this.  I promise you won’t be disappointed.  If you haven’t, then I don’t really know why you’re considering watching the sequel series to something that’s existed for (at the time of this review) four years.  Let’s just hope this doesn’t become another NGNL 2 or S&W 3.  Cause lord knows we’re NEVER getting those.",7
"
                In contrast to the first season, Attack on Titan's second season turned down the dial on intensity giving more focus to developing some of it's side characters and bringing its mysterious elements into the spotlight. I argue that the mysterious elements can be just as intense as the action at times, and that you should keep up with the series despite the drop in action. 
Within the first couple episodes of the season I was on the fence, like I was with the first season, but for the opposite reason. I felt that, instead of the action, the character development was forced/overplayed ... specifically for
                  one of the side characters, Sasha. Why Sasha out of all the characters that could be developed? After re-watching the season and reflecting on my first experience, it seems that watching the episodes once a week as they were released exaggerated that feeling ... but that the feeling was still justified.
Side note: This could be very subjective depending upon what your expectations are and what you want from the series, but for me, I lost some confidence that the second season would be good because of this. It's worth mentioning for those who might share (or who have shared) the same perspective so that they'll push through their initial impression and continue watching.
If a viewer is unwilling to forgive that forced character development they might lose interest when hitting other long stretches of character development. Fortunately for me, my investment in the setting was more than strong enough to get over this initial feeling ... even if I had to wait a week to see something I was more interested in. And the character development that follows for other side characters is much more prevalent to the story and the mysteries carrying over from season 1. It was good to finally get to know some characters introduced at the beginning of the first season. Those newly developed characters: Reiner, Bertholdt, Ymir, Christa, and even Connie to an extent are varied in their personalities, backgrounds, and motivations. I like pretty much all of them (initially said I loved them, but I was probably trying to praise the show too much).
The mystery thriller side of the show was thrust to the forefront with some very shocking developments throughout the season. The season somehow kept up my appetite to know more about the setting even with everything it had revealed, which goes to show the amazing depth the world has in this series. Once one mystery is resolved another replaces it raising anticipation even further. I was really excited to discover the truth to this world after the end of this season.
And then there's the action, which is just as good as it was in the last season but with less quantity and more narrative weight. I can't really say anything about the action more without spoilers.
Overall, this season disrupts the expectations for lots of action set by the first season but is still great because of the ongoing mystery thriller and essential character development. Stick with it; you won't regret it.
ADDENDUMS
4/28/2020 - Looking back on it, I can't really say that Bertholdt is developed much in the second season. He's still kind of underdeveloped at this point (aside from his motivation) and more so serves to help develop Reiner's character. Also, Connie, while not an extra, doesn't really seem to have any defining traits other than his relationship with Ymir in which Ymir harasses and Connie shouts, which isn't much. This could be made up for with overall motivations, but the show never really delves in to Connie's. Although, I'm perfectly fine with this, and probably prefer it this way, considering everything else this season accomplishes. And it's not that I don't like Bertholdt or Connie; it's just my original review might be a bit misleading.
8/2/2020 - If you didn't have faith in the creator to develop the world with consistency at this point, then you might not like some of the reveals this season. To be honest, if you lost faith ... you might not even like the show from here on out because it's going to be one reveal after another that you couldn't possibly predict. And instead of gushing over it like me, you might instead be questioning it every which way you can to find a plot hole and assume that the creator is just covering his tracks to make it work. I understand why people may feel that way, but they're wrong. If you disagree feel free to hit me up and we can fight it out lol. Just so you know, this is my absolute favorite show of all time (as of right now) and I've picked it apart myself upon re-watching several times. There are parts of the plot that could have been explained better, but they don't seem to be the popular complaints people have about plotholes. In other words ... I'm ready for all the shade you can throw my way lmao.",9

                I enjoyed this season of SnK a great deal. It has some brilliant highs - and, to be fair, some frustrating lows as well.
The story is faster paced than season 1, and throws you in to the perilous action right from the start. Episodes 1 and 2 deliver some truly gruesome scenes to remind you of the terrible threat our heroes face, just in case you became complacent during the 4 year wait. The mystery from the close of season 1 is explored, but not resolved in any real way. About midway through Season 2, comes what I regard as the most shocking character revelation
                  throughout all 3 seasons so far; one of the best moments of the show! The resulting battle is also very exciting. The last big highlight of Season 2 is the battle of the final 2 episodes, which provide some brilliant moments for our characters (particularly Erwin and Eren), the revelation of a mysterious new power, and a very satisfying titan conflict.
The main drawback of this season is the time spent on a lot of 'exposition' that truly isn't exposition at all. There's a big focus on the roles of Ymir and Christa, but despite many conversations and flashbacks, their importance is not explained whatsoever during this Season. Related to this is the pursuit of the latter episodes, which provide many snippets of conversations that are understood only by the characters having them, but never by the viewer. And while yes, these mysteries are gradually unclouded in Season 3 which provides some context for their motivations, it makes for a frustrating watch for any first time viewer. I definitely think this part of the storytelling could have been done better; even silence from the would-be kidnappers would be less frustrating than what we got, in my opinion.
Where I think this season shines is in a lot of it's characters. Apart from most of the drama between Ymir and Christa (which is hard to care about), I found myself much more attached to the main cast this season. I really felt Eren's anger in episode 6, and his outburst of frustration in the final episode feels pretty gut-wrenching. Hange is fun to watch, and it's interesting to see some more background of Sasha and Conny. The biggest thing we're missing this season is many scenes with Levi; obviously I understand it makes sense in the story, but it's still kind of a shame!
The OST of Season 2 is mostly more of the same from Season 1 - that is, pretty average; neither bad nor really memorable. However, there is an addition to this score, 'Call of Silence', which I think is the most evocative and memorable track across all 3 seasons so far, and it elevates my overall opinion of the sound here.
The opening of Season 2 is also a highlight - I think second only to the very first opening of SnK. It fills you with determination.
I've continued to watch the Japanese audio, and I have no complaints.
The art just retains the consistent high quality from the first season. It remains one of the series' greatest assets. If you enjoyed the thrilling action sequences of the first season, you won't be disappointed by Season 2.
Overall I found Season 2 thrilling; it lands plenty of great punches. I think if it weren't for the problems concerning the withheld explanations in the story, it could have been the strongest season of SnK out of the 3 so far...but alas it does have that problem. After all, I don't think it's fair to judge the season only by rewatch value. It's a season that is ALMOST reaching perfection, but it's not quite there yet. It leaves you hungry for more answers.",9

                       *DO NOT READ IF YOU IF HAVEN'T WATCHED UP TO EPISODE:33*
                                           *SPOILERS AHEAD*
So....that ending of SNK Season 1 was pretty great right? Are you expecting Season 2 to be as awesome as Season 1? Well it's not. I'd have to agree with some of the other members on this site because this anime is starting to go down hill...fast.
After watching as much as I can while waiting for the new episodes to come out I'm starting to not really understand what's going on anymore first it starts talking about Ymir and Krista,two side characters who literally had almost nothing to do with the first season,then all of a sudden Ymir is a titan or some shit (albeit she's pretty fucking weak considering she's had it longer than Eren has.),Then all of a sudden we're introduced to a Beast? Titan? I don't know he can like boss around the other titans or some shit nothing really cool or new for that matter.But the worst part of this complete shit fest would probably have to be when they're on top of the wall and Reiner literally out of the blue confesses to Eren that he and Bertolt are the Armored Titan and Colossal Titan which just completely fucks up the pacing for the episode and asks Eren to come with them to their hometown while the rest of his comrades are walking away from them LIKE THEY CAN""T EVEN HEAR WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE SAYING,They don't even notice till after they transformed into their titan forms.The biggest thing that agitates me though is the fact that it's nothing but talking for most of the season which I can understand but Season 1 had a good balance of character development as well as really awesome fight scenes (and really depressing moments too....R.I.P Petra) but it was paced well enough to where it didn't feel rushed but I digress, I hope they salvage this season I really do however I'm not the biggest fan of the beast titan (I don't know....he's just not as scary as the other titans are,maybe it's because he doesn't have a creepy ass smile on his face like the rest of the titans do.) But anyways I'm going to keep watching with faith and update my review as the season goes on.

                So its done. Shingeki no Kyojin season 2 has reached its end and it was solid. I could never feel calm with any episode seeing that my favorite scenes from the manga are going to come to life and seeing the development from the cast, seeing the changes a few months can do to the mind of person. Shingeki no Kyojin didn't the same amount of hype it got from season 1 and even though we waited 4 years for 12 episodes, i personally enjoyed this season more and heres why:
the story shifts the tone and focus from the usual jam-packed action with blood all
                  over. instead of making the action elements stronger, the story decided to focus on this mystery, horror-drama with building supporting characters to make the story move. what this season did better is that it let the story thrive not out of shock, crazy explosion etc but with reintroduction of horror and tension, that titans are terrifying to the people. that they pose a serious threat. showing some gorey scenes, telling the viewers what death really is in this universe. though there is still action nonetheless, this season thrived because of its character building and its change in tone, even if levi didn't appear this much in the season, the show used other characters, fleshed them out so that this series isnt just the eren titan killing show. more information is given to us to contribute to mystery horror aspect and used that information to build of the previous seasons unanswered questions. even though more questions are raised this season, the readers can now understand what kind of world the cast are in, what pushes them to fight and even what the titan are doing and brings the question of who they are. its shows us that the story of snk isn't just bound in the surroundings of the wall, that there is something bigger out there.
then we get to my previously mentioned character building. the funny thing is that we practically removed eren from the first half of the season and replaced him with side characters. extraordinary. however, due to that we got to see other characters develop. we got the opportunity to see their motives, past, and their identities which was really a good surprise. because now, when isayama-san decides to kill them off, it'll hurt 10x more. its a double edged sword since in the world of snk, death is bound to happen, yet we still get attached to them, whether they may be side characters or not since we now know what they go through and why they are doing this. the gravity of death is now much much heavier since we now know who they actually are. even if it led to a half an episode worth of flashbacks but the again the change in direction is what made me enjoy this series and season more. its not just anymore shock or action, its now the attachments we have to certain characters and the inevitable pain we get to feel when a death flag raises up. 
the tension and suspense was always present even in obvious regards like the reveal but how it was orchestrated was indeed surprising. the setting, the place, the mood was not the time for a reveal but even so, the way they pulled of a reveal so obvious and still managed to catch the viewers off guard is really impressive. added to that the only titan fight scene in the season that was the anchor of action proved that it wasn't just the usual ""Anata no subete o korosu"" eren line with a couple of screams and punches then a dash of explosions, no. it was a slow paced technical fight, like something you'll see out of mma sparring match. every move is calculated and its reasonable enough for everyone to understand. this fight is well orchestrated enough that you could analyze this at sport science if you have the chance. its show the development of eren as a character, that a titan form is not anymore a get out of jail card. he now has to control himself since this season established that titans are no mere threat.
this season didn't receive the hype it got before and i believe thats a good thing. you can just sit back and appreciate the show in your own regard. you can survive a week with since not every titan in an episode is getting meme the f out and there are no overly analyzed situations. the less hype around this season let me enjoy snk for what a solid show it is. even though it was 4 years, the art is still amazing, the soundtrack hasn't changes, the changes were not the overboard and it almost feels like 4 years didn't pass at all. the things is what shingeki no kyojin needed was momentum, the hype train can only go so far and 4 years was stretching it. even though it felt like nothing changed 4 years ago, it was still 4 years ago. in that span we've seen countless shows and that hype train slowly came to a stop because no matter how good a show is, you can't expect to be not bored listening to the same details, jokes, opinions, praises about it. the hype train just moved on and looked to other shows with better continuity. also as i personally enjoyed these 12 episodes, it just feels like that 4 years for 12 eps was underwhelming. one of most hyped show getting 12 of its continuity really makes me question how this anime is going to move forward with season 3 if ever, do i have to wait another 4 years? its a shame really, the hype train is amazing and maybe the change of focus will not be of taste to others, i enjoyed aot definitely. though this show or any show in this regard that was so hot and solid,
we have to understand that father time is undefeated.",8

                F's REVIEW:
When I wrote my review on the first season, I pointed to the fact that Shingeki no Kyojin's diegetic universe is set in the future, effectively backing away from some genre's clichés that surround the futurist dystopian stories as well as inciting some doubts in the spectator's mind regarding the details of that unknown ambient. Well, after seeing the second season, I can easily affirm: this is still the show's highlight, even though here we keep getting closer to a very unusual and original sci-fi. 
I also had the impression that this time the choices taken in favor of the narrative's setting were more
                  daring than in the beginning. By this I mean that we are shown to the character's background stories which goes beyond the sealed cosmos in those walls we already know of, in addition of being a major relief the obvious conscious that these ""daily"" memories enrich the atmosphere better than that repetitive and exhaustive gore of the previous season -- even if that hasn't been completely abolished and the screenplay often resort to some easy ways out, namely the discarding of irrelevant characters, aiming at a melodramatic catharsis. 
If some of those flashbacks that break into the episodes usually lead us to cringy and overtly sentimental cues, it's still worth noting the effort in the try of distancing the characters off unilateral stereotypes that haunted them back in the time. This attempt in its own is enough to prove the sophisticated narrative this show is at least aiming for though it's not completely immune of some stumbles here and there, as such as in these mnemonic metaphysical spaces always showing up in the wrong time and places just to disturb the flux that otherwise would accomplish its goal so naturally.
I would also like to share as well my unassuming guess that the less we see of Eren Jaeger, the better the story gets. Sadly I can't help feeling this protagonist and all the ""baggage"" he carries along with him, being the nearly ubiquitous images of his traumas (really? are we going to see THAT memory again?) or his explosive personality which lacks depth, is the big and arduous rock holding the anime down in some genre conventions. But... like so many scenes where the heroes suddenly manifest their forces out of determination and manage to get away from a threat, the hope of seeing Shingeki no Kyojin head towards a refined and accurate storytelling was freshened by these 12 episodes that, if sometimes miss in its content, at least the shape can offer moments of sheer fun and stun, even more if we take into account the carefully well-crafted art and sound designs inhereted from season 1. 
~~~~~~~~
P's REVIEW:
Succintly sayin', the second season of Shingeki no  Kyojin keeps the same qualities and flaws from the previous season. I mean... this is not easy at all,  as amazingly as it seems, since keeping the quality of an anime throughout the time without letting the spectators get sick of the characters and the story is a real challenge.
That said, I'm absolutely lookin' forward for the next episodes and hopeful for the show to keep on this track, maintaning its high level.

"
                Before this season was about to air, Wit studio released a letter of apology, not for being 4 years late or for less episodes, but for making an anime so good that it'd drive you crazy, and to an extent, they did just that. 
The season quickly reintroduced the setting and what makes it so fun and scary. While season 1 took it's time building a world and setting up interesting reveals, season 2 capitalizes on it and delves deeper into the plot, exploring some interesting side characters and spontaneously teasing some future reveals which helps build the story for future arcs. 
I've praised this
                  a thousand times in my life but the animation and music are god tier and I could go on talking about it all day. Eren vs Armored Titan is one of the best things I've seen this year. They just know how to make a great scene and pull you into it. 
I do have some knocks on this anime tho, First and foremost, no Levi. He made like two or three small apps that's all. Levi is just the main miss though, With only 12 episodes it just wasn't enough. Characters like Jean didn't stay with us, hell even Eren, Mikasa and Armin didn't get much screentime tbh, this season was carried by Ymir, Christa and Reiner. Which isn't a bad thing, it's just that some of the moments I got from my favorite characters in season 1, I missed in this one, it isn't really a big knock tho, I just loved season 1 a lot more.
Overall this was still an entertaining season, it had some incredible standout scenes and a great story that made it truly worthwhile.
Rating:- 8.75/10",9
"
                When I first saw Shingeki No Kyojin's first season, I realized how mediocre and overrated this anime was. The bad animation when it has to be natural, the poor methods of showing feelings, the lack of development of the characters, and how clamsy it was to tell us hard situations and subjects. 
Nevertheless, this new season has improved almost all of these mistakes and is finally what I would expect from this kind of anime. I would like to put the example of ""Cowboy Bebop"": it's exactly the same kind of anime and is as good as this 2d season. It also treats these kind
                  of subjects and develops his characters by speaking. 
Now, the animation when there's no action is much better, and the characters finally talk a bit more and don't scream every single second. There are however still other mistakes that should be changed, like this technic of making eyes vibre every single second to show feelings like fear or rage. 
In general, this new season tries more the speaking and not the stunning, and I think that's why it works so well right now. I am looking forward to watch the third season more than ever.",7
"
                It's amazing how just a tiny bit of room to breathe can make such a huge difference.
Attack on Titan Season 2 really isn't all that different from Season 1. Eren still screams about murdering all the titans way too much, people still get eaten like it's going out of style, and the fights all look amazing, but the biggest thing that bugged me about Season 1, the overdramatization of minor events making major events feel less impactful, has been completely fixed, and it turns out that was all it took to lift this show up to being worthy of the hype.
I absolutely loved the added
                  variety in tone this season got. Quiet moments like Hannes, Mikasa, and Armin reminiscing about the good old days before riding off on a mission just adds so much to the series. Don't even get me started on how they chose to handle the big reveal, no fanfare, no dramatic music, if you were only half paying attention, you would've missed it, which made it have so much more impact when you did realize what they were talking about.
That's not to say the hype machine shut down. Eren vs the Armored Titan was better than any fight Season 1 had, and the scene where a titan skull crashes down straight at the camera, followed by a hard cut to black and ""to be continued"" made me jump out of my seat.
This season also did a lot for the series as far as plot and characters go. Events happen much more organically now, with one problem not politely waiting for the previous one to get wrapped up to start wreaking havok, which makes a lot of sense. Characters like Hannes, Reiner, and Commander Ervin got a lot of time to shine and came to really old their own. One complaint I had was Mikasa, who was my favorite character in Season 1, regressed quite a bit in this season, but considering they made even Eren's screaming feel important by the end, I'm willing to forgive that.
This is a weird review simply because they didn't do anything earth shattering, they just gave us a reason to care about the world and characters and that's all it took for the already amazing action to shine.",8
"
                Okay Let me say this series is of the highest production value. It had to be to justify the wait. That’s all well and good. I watched season two as though I hadn’t seen season one. And really enjoyed the first six episodes. Then I encountered the very issues I had with season one. I’m willing to forgive this series it’s sins save two. One Kamille Bidan, I mean Erin Yaeger. All he does is throw a tantrum. I enjoyed the series when he isn’t the central focus of the episode. Every other character is more interesting, fun to watch and has greater depth than
                  him. I kept waiting for someone to “correct” him. The second sin is it’s pacing. Not gonna spoil it here but despite all that happens so little actually happens. After that wait I expected more. At the end I’m left feeling “What, that’s it?” rather than, “I need more.” Bonus points for the ending theme ""Yuugure no Tori (夕暮れの鳥)"" by Shinsei Kamattechan.
 Originally I was gonna wait for season three to complete its run and watch both. That’s what I suggest to anyone reading this review to decide if they’re gonna watch it or not. Wait For Season Three.",7
"
                ""We don't know enough about the titans yet, but there might be some kind of highly valuable information in my basement down in Shiganshina. We should go there immediately...""
The line that Eren never said. Ever. Seriously, in episode 2 we learn that this basement is extremely important and not knowing what's in there was ridiculous after 25 episodes. Now it has been 37 whole episodes and I don't know what to think anymore. Who can look at Shingeki no Kyojins plot with a straight face after watching 37 episodes of this!?
The betrayal scene  was pretty cool though.
ATTACK ON TITAN, your sales were high, you
                  hit your stride
NOT A DRY EYE, when Hannes die-yied, yes we cried, but that aside
ATTACK ON TITAN, your plot has milewide gaping holes

ATTACK ON TITAN, you were ambitious, you had guts
MAYBE PIE-EYED, some parts were real kicks in the nuts
but you kicked butts",7
"
                Attack on titan season first was one of the more engrossing anime for westerners and introduced them to this media, i have a great deal of respect for the author trying something new. Its not particularly original but it made this sorta of manga hugely popular having much of spinoffs based on this idea of horror, story is nothing amazing u seen better stories out their but doesn't need to be it does so well for what it presents. incorporating 2D and 3D animation seamlessly together having the consumer a vivid experience and being one of the few new animes thats R 18 rated with
                  this types of production. I have been watching anime for years almost a decade now,  attack on titan doesn't need to be particularly original it knows what it is, a fun action anime with some horror elements. The pacing for this season is better handled than last season, while music in the show has an epic vibe and done really well but opening is not as strong (but thats not a complaint). The voice acting especially on a certain person (won't spoil) is exactly how interpreted it in the manga and well utilised. My biggest problem in particular is really the characters they don't really have much layers few do but sometimes scenes just drag lot with okay dialogue. But the art and enjoyable factor is really high and well manga is well realised. Just in ep 4 and atm is pretty Solid
Overall my score will actually be 7.5/10 its nothing amazing but its not trying to be, just a fun show i rating it in 8/10 in myanimelist because they are really bias and number system is not good like people interpreted it here 7 fun, 8 good,9 great and 10 outstanding but 6 below don't count as anything good.",8

                I was not really looking forward to Season 2 right after watching Season 1, but this season was not nearly as unpleasant to watch. It spends more time developing the story instead of being a gorefest, and I feel like the plot is going somewhere. But it also felt like a purely transitional part, so it can't stand on its own and it's hard to review it without knowing what will happen in later seasons.
I'll start with the good things. The good parts of Season 1 are still present here. Great animation and sound design, with well-composited 3D CGI. The plot still seems to have
                  a lot of thought behind it, though it's hard to know that for sure at this point in the story. 
In terms of improvement, I felt like the constant suspense/despair cycle of Season 1 was toned down greatly. There seems to be a clearer goal now, so I also don't feel nearly as lost.
But there were also some big problems. This season didn't really answer any of my questions from the first season. While we did learn that Reiner and Bertolt are the Armored and Colossal titans respectively, I had already suspected as much given their relationship and the similarity between Reiner and Armored. It also seems that there are multiple independent factions within the titan-shifters, in addition to the titans and titan-shifters being separate. Many of the characters were also unwilling to answer any questions, and offered no explanation as to why they couldn't explain anything.
In general, this season just positioned the story such that these questions can be better answered in the future, but created new questions in the meantime.
Eren's ability also changed with no explanation. I was expecting Eren to be some sort of fire titan, but now he's the ""Coordinate"" and can control titans. This sudden shift makes me much less confident in the overall integrity of the story.
This season also shows many of the characters as one-dimensional. Eren has his hatred of titans, Mikasa is fixated on Eren, Krista and Ymir have a strong codependent relationship, Erwin has his need to understand the titans... etc. While it makes the characters themselves dramatically less interesting, I expect all this to be addressed. It gives me some clues to the future direction of the series, and leads me to a theory:
I suspect that the ruling family found some way of turning people into titans. They used the power in the past to create their kingdom and eliminate their enemies, but they were so singly focused on their own success that they didn't foresee the issues with their plans. The world was pretty much destroyed, and when the people found out what happened they overthrew the king. Remnants of the ruling family like Krista still persist, and still have some significance in the titan situation.
While I don't think Attack on Titan is particularly good at this point, I am certainly intrigued. I'm looking forward to having a lot of questions answered in Season 3.",6
"
                I definitely enjoyed the second season of this anime more than the first. I don't know if it's because it had already picked up steam by this point or simply because the plot was better, but I was able to sit down and watch this season without getting sidetracked, which allowed me to finish it quicker. 
I think that there was more structure as far as future progression in this second season. The first season felt like it was mostly about backstory and setup to me. I think I'm more used to quick setup than I am a season-long setup. 
Anyway, this season's journey into
                  the minds of the Titans and the history behind them was great to learn about. This still isn't an absolute perfect anime for me, but this season stepped it up, for sure.",8
"
I feel reviewing this after seeing season 3 gives the most value. Mainly because without knowing where seasons 3 takes you, this seems on the face of it, a bit of a boring season when comparing with the first. However, following the first part of season 3 you realise how necessary it is.
Firstly it takes on a more political tone and although does it well, it just feels a little lacking compared to the first season. The story has a few interesting moments but still you find yourself, without meaning to, comparing to season 1. Let’s be fair though, that just proves how good Season
                  1 was.
The action scene you get have the same issue. Although they are great when comparing to most other anime’s of its kind, it still falls short when compared to season 1.  Animation however is somewhere it does not fall short. It is of the same exceptionally high standard and it one key part that helps pull you through the shorter season 2.
The other area is which it does not fall short are the reveals in the story. As with season 1, they are just as exciting and provide the perfect next step to expand the Attack on Titan world.
This season is the perfect bridge between the introduction of season 1 and the world expansion of season 3. It does exactly what it needs to but not what you hope it to.",8
"
                The plot doesn't progress very far in SNK season 2. It feels like even though I actually watched 12 episodes, I only watched 3 episodes or so.
The art is outstanding because most of the time everything is animated smoothly and drawn nicely. However, there were a few parts where they got lazy, and I wonder if they are gonna fix those parts for blu-ray versions.
The OP is done by the same musician of the previous OP songs: Linked Horizon. The OSTs and sound effects sound great and well timed (I think).
Are the characters relatable and realistic? I think it depends on what you consider is
                  relatable. For me at the moment, the characters are not as relatable as those from such anime like Ouran Koukou Host Club, K-on, and other slice-of-life anime. The character design for SNK is very well done in my opinion, but in SNK season 2, most of the screen time was focused on the action and progressing of the story rather than character development (excluding Reiner, Bertolt, and Ymir) so the character development did not have a big influence on the enjoyment of this season. Though Reiner, Bertolt, and Ymir had a huge character development, I wanted more development of the main characters because they were more important to the viewer. 
The reason SNK season 2 was so enjoyable is because of the action. Every episode ended with a cliffhanger and always had some kind of suspense that gave thrill. It was one of those anime you end up binge watching because of the thrill.
Overall I gave this anime a score of 10 because I am quite satisfied with the fact that they stuck to the manga plot, the art was very good, the music was nice, and it was very enjoyable. It always made me wait for next week to watch the next episode.",10
"
                Spoiler free: for both seasons and manga.
Loved it, the clever plot mechanics are carried over from the first season, and here the tension erupts in multiple aspects. The story continues with multiple twists and turns. Confirmation of theories and suspicions are shown, rending surprises galore ambush you. Everything's going on plot wise and is shown across multiple fronts, and yet with each new revelation it only commands more questions, though thankfully there is not an extended wait for the next episodes, and at any rate it is Attack on Titan which is well worth the wait. 
Goes without saying that the story is currently, and
                  can glue itself into animated history, as the most interesting premise, only Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood delivered a similar vibe. And like that, Attack on Titan continues to flesh out it's own unique concept with this season. It's not really something to describe or explain, go and experience it for yourselves.
The animation is excellent, there are some scenes that the overly critical may find suspect, but in all honesty the art could be appalling and yet you would still be focused solely on the characters, the plot and everything that's done right with this season, the amazing animation is just an extra cherry on the cake. 
The manga has it's own charms style wise, and that is where the anime can come in and add extra layers of awesome if you like. This works wonders with the 3D manoeuvre gear, and especially the titans, in all their weird and wonderful appearances and movements. 
The true achievement of the animation is that it adds a vibrant life to the black and white pages of the manga and presents the audience with a truly beautiful world described by the characters, which works even more effectively considering the, er, joyful tone of the titans, and the atmosphere of the world.
Sound, even minute details can make all the difference to more technical reviewers. Acknowledge that the sound is what ensures Attack on Titan is cutting edge objectively speaking. Background noises are very effective and the music exemplifies the tone of each respective scene.
Voice acting for both Subbed and Dubbed versions are on form, since it's such a great series, they can both be enjoyed, and repeatedly. Without giving the game away, always remember that practically speaking you can hear some of the best voice acting possible, no matter how you feel about Attack on Titan concept wise, one cannot refute the amazingness of the cast voices, their reactions and tones, again helps to hear for yourself.
After scoring an iconic, indeed possibly the best, certainly most well known opening song, the studio did play it safe with a similar one this time round. No need for that, as the second part of the first season showed, feel free to branch out and make more distinct opening songs, the studio certainly has a knack for making great ones.
The characters are given focus to bring the background of Attack on Titan to the forefront, and it was sensible to focus a twelve episode arc for the characters in question, and the issues they are involved with. Even those who are briefly introduced seem as human as anything in real life, even more so when they're in whatever situations they are in. To be able to make newly introduced people and be invested in them is no easy task for a series to pull off.
The greater praise goes to the main cast, there is a focus on what were secondary characters from the first season and this was the time to see more of who they were, and their reactions. Sasha is a key example of this, more significantly it is Ymir, who after this is one of the most intriguing and remarkable people ever seen. Certainly an out of this world unique background, and this is the season where there are even more who could have seen that coming revelations on top of everything else.
The characters are a great foil for the dark atmosphere Attack on Titan masterfully creates, the world, characters and their views and actions are why something with a premise so incredibly dark can work. For all the horror, indeed new horrors this time around, the tone succeeds because we have a cast that can be cared about to focus on. Anything can happen, no ones safe, so when said things happen it is wounding because we care, considering the stakes this even applies to people briefly seen.
Attack on Titan is classic case of if you want a tree to grow to heaven, it has to have roots that grow down to hell. It would be a mistake for people to be put off by the gore, for just as extreme and violent the show can be, it has everything that reaches the other extreme in terms of scenery, characters, mystery, plot, everything.
Like the best things you can praise it all you want, and yet critical appraisal is largely meaningless. This isn't something to poke at, or try and find flaws, you just enjoy everything about it. Attack on Titan earns it's status as one of the best series out there, the only reason this isn't awarded higher is because the scoring and review applies to just this twelve episode, one arc animation. An overall score of the entire series would be higher, and if WIT studio continues to excel in the development of the rest of the series then, considering what's coming in the manga, it can be higher still.",8

                THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST ANIME TO EVER STREAM ON KISSANIME AND WE CAN'T FORGET THE OP 2. THE PROTAGONIST HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS BUT HE EEND UP SOLVING IT THE STORYLINE WAS AMAZING AND MADE ME WANT TO WATCH MORE.  THE ARTWORK IS AMAZING AND  AND GOT A REALISTIC PLEASURE AND THE SOUND WORK IS PRETTY GOOD I WAS HAPPY THAT THE WAS NOT A LOT OF BOOM BANG IT WAS CLEAR THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT WAS SOMETHING TO BE PLEASED 
TO BE REAL WITH YOU THE IS A LOT TO EXPECT IN THIS ANIME FOR EXAMPLE PLOT TWIST CHRARATER DEVOLPOLMENT
                  AND MORE IF WE COULD HAVE A LITTLE MORE BACKGROUND STORY IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND MORE BUT OVERALL IT WAS GOOD",10
"
                Attack on Titan is a action filled anime that gets you from the start. It has a ton of gore but it's not without cause. From the very start you're introduced to three children, two of them follow around the main character around everywhere and do whatever he wants. He is a hot headed fool for the most part who tends to get into a lot of fights. Within the first ten minutes you get a feel of what the series is about and it only gets crazier from there. 
The animation is beautiful, I love the colors, the fluid movements, and how different each
                  character looks. You can tell a lot of love and time was put into it and it does not fail. Each character has their own traits none are the same and each one have their own path's to take. Though the main focus of course is on Eren. 
The first season was filled with Titans, learning, flash backs and making you want to know what was in that basement! It left me with more questions than answers and a thirst for more. The second season was relatively the same in that aspect. You learnt a lot from the second season and honestly it will shock you quite a lot if you haven't read the manga, or you don't pay attention to the subtle clues through out. 
Where the first season is all about Eren and learning his abilities the second one is more about his squad of people and finding out their lives as well. It has so much more character development that I absolutely loved. The first season felt like there was so much missing and the second season isn't much different. You are left feeling like so much more could have been done but it leaves you excited for season three. 
All in all this is an exciting anime with two meaty seasons that leave you wanting more. It's fast paced, action packed and full of development. It's honestly a greatly anime that if you don't mind gore and action then I suggest give it a try.",9

                - English Review (Translated version)
I can actually understand the impact of ""Shingeki no Kyojin"". It seems logical to me that it has caused a furor and is a benchmark in terms of popularity: it is vibrant, visually spectacular, has a moderately attractive story, fighting and charismatic characters (not all). It is a very correct anime, with elements that mixed are a good seed for popularity and also had that bit of luck to appear at the right time. Of course it is, but not a masterpiece. It is by far not among the best in the world in terms of quality.
I've already written my impressions
                  about ""Shingeki"" in the first season and this second one is a straightforward sequel, so broadly speaking the rating hasn't changed much. But I also think that this second set of episodes is one point above by a couple of details. So I'm going to focus on them for this review.
The argument thread despite having a slower pace has gained in quality, maturity. The plot is much more consistent, more serious. There is much more background in secondary stories and in flashbacks, there are more and better plot twists, in general the whole plot is much better compacted. And as I point out, the battles and fights are the right and necessary. For some people this may seem bad (I've had enough of reading the cursed word: filler), for me it is makes ""Shingeki no Kyojin"" more solid anime and less superfluous bullshit.
Another point to highlight that has improved somewhat is characters. All right, Eren is still the protagonist, but in this season he appears considerably less. It has also evolved in personality, becoming less unbearable than usual. Not a marvel either, but something is something. The fact that the weight of the argument throughout the episodes is focused by charismatic secondary characters such Sasha, Ymir, Reiner or Christa/Historia gives it a varied and interesting nuance. And that the overvalued Levy will barely appear on screen during the season is to be welcomed. A lot.
Visually, it's still a real bust. Truly spectacular both artistic style and performance. And they have given themselves the luxury of increasing the level of gore in terms of deaths, something that I am not enthusiastic about, but it will certainly be good news for some people. Music is still one of his strong points, with a BSO at an incredible level. On the negative side, the opening and ending are quite normal and not very original. They could have done better with them.
- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)
En realidad puedo entender el éxito de ""Shingeki no Kyojin"". Me parece lógico que haya causado furor y sea un referente en cuanto a popularidad: es vibrante, visualmente espectacular, tiene una historia medianamente atractiva, combates y personajes con carisma (no todos). Es un anime muy correcto, con elementos que mezclados son un buen germen para la popularidad y que además ha tenido ese puntito de suerte de aparecer en el momento adecuado. Eso está claro que lo es, pero una obra maestra no. Ni de lejos está entre lo mejor del mundillo en cuanto a calidad.
Ya escribí mis impresiones sobre ""Shingeki"" en la primera temporada y esta segunda es una continuación directa, así que a grandes rasgos no ha cambiado demasiado la valoración. Pero igualmente pienso que esta segunda tanda de capítulos está un punto por encima por un par de detalles. Así que me voy a centrar en ellos para esta reseña.
El hilo argumental a pesar de tener un ritmo más lento ha ganado en calidad, en madurez. La trama se nota mucho más consistente, más seria. Hay mucho más trasfondo en cuanto a historias secundarias y en cuanto al pasado, hay más y sobre todo mejores giros de guión, en general toda la trama está mucho mejor compactada. Y como apunte, los combates y batallas que hay son los justos y necesarios. A algunos esto le puede parecer mal (me he hartado de leer la dichosa palabrita: relleno), a mí lo que me parece es que esto hace a ""Shingeki no Kyojin"" más anime sólido y menos chorrada superflúa.
Otro a punto a destacar que ha mejorado algo es el apartado de personajes. De acuerdo, Eren sigue siendo el protagonista, pero en este tramo de forma mucho menos absoluta, aparece bastante menos. Además ha evolucionado en cuanto a personalidad, haciéndose menos insoportable que de costumbre. Tampoco una maravilla, pero algo es algo. Que el peso del argumento a lo largo de los capítulos lo lleven secundarios carismáticos como Sasha, Ymir, Reiner o Christa/Historia le da un matiz variado e interesante. Y que el sobrevalorado de Levy apenas aparezca en pantalla durante la temporada es de agradecer. Mucho.
Visualmente sigue siendo una auténtica pasada. Verdaderamente espectacular tanto el estilo artístico como la ejecución. Y se han dado el lujo de aumentar el nivel de gore en cuanto a las muertes, algo que a mí no me entusiasma, pero seguro que para algunos será buena noticia. La música sigue siendo uno de sus puntos fuertes, con una BSO con un nivel increíble. En el debe, el opening y el ending son bastante normaluchos y poco originales. Podrían haber hecho algo mejor con ellos.",7

                Much like the creatures depicted within its story, Titan is a strange beast.  Apparently, Japan decided to double their national debt to finance this series; you can guess from watching the opening sequence alone.  I'm not saying that it's wrong to eliminate your senior citizen's pensions to finance an anime, but i can't understand why you'd waste the money on this material and not something better.  
Cause don't be fooled, Titan isn't some masterpiece of storywriting.  This can often be well hidden under the massive production, but the mediocrity is there.  As an experiment, try this: watch Titan, and skip
                  all the action scenes.  You'll realize three things :
1. You're bored out of your mind
2. You don't know what the hell is going on
3. You still watched 90% of the show in spite of skipping those scenes
Indeed, in between the action scenes, you will be treated to a huge cast of unmemorable characters sitting around talking, for the most part.  And you will have no clue what they're talking about.  This is because Titan tries its hardest to be as ""mysterious"" as possible.  As a result, characters are tip-toeing around story elements constantly while they are conversing to avoid revealing anything.  It's alarming to realize nothing concrete ever gets said.  These conversations are a pure waste of time: they are not entertaining, they don't reveal anything, they don't clear anything up, and they sure as hell don't feel natural.  Look, I can understand that after using half of the 2018 Olympics budget on the action scenes, that there is no money left for the rest of the show (or for the ladies' javelin competition).  But that's not an excuse; just make a 2 hour movie and don't feed me all this obvious filler.  Titan ends up being a very frustrating watch most of the time (stop with the damn flashbacks, please god).  And after all these hinted-at plot points, you can just feel like it isn't really going anywhere, or that it'll take 20 years to get there.  
Fortunately, it doesn't matter that much that most of the show is filler.  The action scenes are usually such concentrated awesome, that the show delivers, over the course of its duration, more entertainment than a great number of animes.  The animation is unparalleled, the soundtrack is powerful and high-energy, and the characters are intense and emotional.  Sometimes i found myself cheering like a kid over a few great moments.  It really shows what you can achieve if you aren't afraid of selling half of your country's gold reserves to do it.  
Titan's a show that you can't NOT watch.  One because the animation is just that good, and two because tens of thousands of people have had their welfare cut off to produce this anime. Don't let their sacrifice be in vain.  Just don't expect a masterpiece.  10 for the action, 4 for the rest, so 7 on average.",7
"
                AoT/SnK, first and foremost, is a show/manga built on hype. That's what propels the series forward, sells manga volumes, and sells AoT figures. This season was full of 'hype' moments for sure, some of them monumental to the story. I'm not going to insert any spoilers here, but there's a few select moments where something dramatic happens and then Eren + crew proceed to scream said victim's name in pure agony, while their faces shake on screen, tears bounce off their eyes, and dark lines and shadows are added to convey the despair felt by said characters. This, combined with the opera-like music, makes you
                  ""feel the feels"". Anyway, I feel like I'm getting ahead of myself and my review is already super all over the place. So now I'm going to talk about each aspect of the show individually. And GO!
Story:
This is easily one of the most difficult aspects of the show to talk about without spoiling anything. To be frank, as the show progresses, the story proceeds to get more and more messy. Events happen quickly, and some side-plots feel rushed. Historia's arc is so boring I can't even begin to describe it. I know she's a vital piece to the plot, but characters constantly repeating how important she is gets irritating. Oh! And another thing. A lot of characters exist just for the sake of the plot progressing forward. Sometimes though, it doesn't feel like it's moving forward; that's due to the strange pacing the show has. At times, it seems like the show doesn't know where it's going or wants to go. So many side plots and character arcs are tossed in, which makes the main plot seem not as important or interesting. In the very last episodes of the season the story starts to pick up after a big reveal, but after finishing the show, I can't say that I remember what happened in the first few episodes, or even first half of this season. Some major plot points from season 1 are ignored, while others are brought in. Eren's basement? Eh, who cares. Let's get to that in another season. Ok, but now I've lost interest to what's in that basement. So there. Bascially, the story is not the strongest aspect of AoT season 2.
Art:
There's no denying that the artistic direction is a definite strong point of the show. It's dramatic, impactful, and at times, gorgeously grotesque. The facial expressions of the characters when something terrifying happens perfectly conveys the despair they are feeling in that moment of time. It kind of stays with you, in a weird way. Even the flat characters (hi Bertholdt) give really intense facial expressions, which adds so much to the show. The backgrounds are nice, movement of the horses and characters with the maneuver gear is awesome, and the camera angles are for the most part, perfect. 
Sound:
I love the music in AoT. In fact, it may be my favorite aspect of the show. It's intense when it needs to be, timed perfectly with the dialogue, and the musicianship of the instrumentalists and singers is impeccable. The opening song is noteworthy, for sure. The buildup to the chorus is strong, the singer and orchestral background with crashing symbols is magnificent. And dat SASAGEYO doe. The ending song is eery and creepy, with strange moving pictures and weird music. It just feels off. But it's unique and strangely endearing. You can form your own opinion of it, I guess. The OST is great too, with standout tracks being YouSeeBigGIRL TT, Call of Silence, and EREN The Coordinate. 
Character:
Character development was overall very weak in this season. A lot of characters that we grew to love in season one (such as Jean, Armin and Levi) are completely ignored for a majority of the season. Jean barely had any lines, and his character growth was nonexistent. Levi was in maybe 5 scenes. And Armin, who I actually grew to like more this season, was not featured enough to feel like he got sufficient development. Uninteresting characters like Historia and Connie got a lot of screen-time for the sake of discovering the identity of the titans. Annie? Who's that? Never heard of her. Honestly forgot that she existed until the tree episode where Reiner brings her up. Speaking of Reiner, I actually grew quite fond of him this season. He got A LOT of development, which added so much depth to his character. Bertholdt got more screen-time as well, and I'm interested to learn more about him and his backstory in the next season. Eren, the main protagonist... well... he sucks. He's just too predictable. He's hot-headed, impulsive, yada yada you get the point. ""i FiGhT fOr mY fRiEnDs!1!1!!1!"" I hate him. Honestly, why is Armin not the main protagonist. Sorry, I'm getting ranty. I'm going to move on to the next section before I erupt of rage.
Enjoyment:
Despite all of my qualms, AoT is an enjoyable show. While it was airing, I waited in anticipation every week for the next episode to be uploaded online. Though the show has many faults, it's ultimately how much you enjoy it that matters. And I really did enjoy it.
Overall:
Overall, I would recommend watching season two of AoT if you enjoyed season one. It's a worthy addition to the series, and I'm anxious to see if season three, which will is expected to be coming out in 2018, delivers.
Thanks for reading my review!:)",8

                I've seen enough anime now (52.2 days) that it doesn't give me that ineffable feeling of wonder I felt when watching it for the first time last year; as such, I watch less anime nowadays and am far more selective about what to watch at the moment.
One anime that I'm always eager to watch each week is no less than the almighty, the godly, the undeniably awesome, the Attack on Titan or Shingeki no Kyojin. Wit Studio continues to render me stunned speechless at the sheer quality of its animation. Hiroyuki Sawano continues to bless my ears with his soundtrack. Hajime Isayama continues to impress
                  me with the thunderous implications of the story, of the true nature of the Titans and what it could possibly mean for the future of mankind.
I can always read the manga and get ahead, but I can't. This anime is just too good to use as a second immersion into such a brilliant premise. I need to see the revelations for the first time on the screen and in color. It hurts, but I have to wait until 2018 for season 3.
In terms of production, Wit Studio and everybody involved in the creation of this masterwork deserves high kudos. Both seasons of Shingeki no Kyojin are filled with so many intense moments that reify the two-dimensional nature of the anime and give it a more lifelike, eerily real presence that can't go away. I don't care what critics say, this is what makes the anime medium so outstandingly different from any other medium. Attack on Titan is amazing.

                WARNING, THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
My biggest problem with the first season was some of the stupid plot points and the inconsistent tone, both of which were solved. This season didn't have as many jokes, and when it did, it didn't clash with the show's tone. The plot points I had with the first season was mostly because of Eren being able to turn into a titan. At the time, we didn't really know how they did it or how many, so it seemed like Eren was the chosen one, which isn't a good plot device. But in this season, we see more human titans
                  and we see more of how they turned into them. The way they choose to explain more about the titans also gives the series a new tone. The tone being mystery. Learning more about all the characters, the new characters and plot points all help the new mysterious tone. The only thing I can think of that doesn't go too well with the mystery tone is the ED. Though the ED was great, only ED I can think that has actually terrified me, it fits better with the first season, which has a more horror vibe. What was so great about the new tone was that it gave the writers a way to develop the side characters more, now that they wanted more people to be titans. This made the characters much better. Cause before, the side characters were not very interesting, especially compared to this.
But even though the mystery tone was great, some of the mysterious aspects were not handled great. Many interesting plot points didn't really have reason to be there. Like the ape titan who showed for a few episodes and disappeared to only reappear for a few seconds for no reason other than to show something I already knew. This is a shame, cause he was really interesting. His design, much like all other titans in the show, actually looked scary, and not stupid like in the first season, and it seemed like he had something to do with turning humans into titans which were really interesting. 
So those are my thoughts on Attack on Titan season 2. Overall I thought that the show was better than the first season, mostly because of the story. Have a good day",9
"
                Attack on Titan S2 was another good season. A new realization was gained for the protagonist where there are enemies other than titans. Two “allies” of the Survey Corps happened to be those enemies along with another character in S1. It was well done. Also, the main character has shown that he has no armor and he is taken captive by these enemies to show a new power. With this betrayal we see the main character go through a change of severe and anger and distaste. Now he has more enemies other than his enemy Titans. My problem with this season was showing characters that
                  we didn’t care about. Also, there were characters killed for the sake of being killed. Overall 8/10.",8

So after 4 years we finally got the 2nd season of AoT, but after watching it myself those 4 years (well for people who watched it 4 years ago) of waiting were definitely worth waiting for.
The story continues with Erens crusade to destroy every Titan in existence and immediately after defeating Annie a new revelation about the Titans is discovered and a random attack inside wall Rose provides more questions for the Survey Corps, but during their defence of Wall Rose the identity of the Armoured and Colossal Titan is finally unveiled.
Now for only 12 episodes the story in this season is insane
                  so many things are revealed to us and even things we probably didn't even know about are revealed too.
The biggest reveal of the season is of course the identity of the Colossal and Armoured Titans who turn out to be Bertholdt and Reiner, their reveal was so nonchalant that it made me laugh, but when they transformed in front of Eren and the other corpsmen it was absolutely fantastic my mouth was wide open in amazement and it is a scene that will forever be in my memory and is probably my favourite moment along with Eren emerging from his titan form in S1 E8.
There is also the revelation of Titans being in the walls themselves which provides us with more questions, but answers why the Colossal titan never attacked the walls and only went for the gates during the attack on Trost and Shiganshina and because of this it is linked to Krista and Ymir, it is revealed that Ymir is actually a titan herself and like Reiner and Bertholdt isn't from within the walls and Krista seems to have actually been someone else all along.
We even get to see the true origin of the Titans even though it might've been a little obvious by now the titans are actually humans who were turned into giant monsters as Connie finds out that a titan looked like his mother which shows that titans used to be normal humans.
The Beast or Ape Titan also makes an appearance although he isn't around a lot only just for a few moments in the first 4 episodes, but doesn't show up again till the very end, however the same can be said for the Colossal and Armoured Titans who only made one or two appearances in the first season, hell even our old friend the smiling titan the titan that killed Erens mother also makes a reappearance making for one epic finale.
Now some characters that were in the supporting role during season 1 definitely got a lot more screentime during this season which meant that characters like Levi, Jean and Erwin didn't get that much screentime however I think the screentime we got with the other characters was just what the show needed.
Eren, Mikasa and Armin don't change too much in this season, but there is a few sentimental moments between these characters especially during the later episodes, Eren was definitely more mature this season often following peoples orders and mostly agreeing with them until he found out about Reiner and Bertholdt he finally let out the rage he has had contained for 5 years and it really was something and then his breakdown in the final episode was actually a little heart breaking until Mikasa helped him see a new light which brings me onto Mikasa herself, she continues to be my favourite character of the show as she still proves to be an amazing badass and certainly a terrifying one at that with some of the stares she made especially the one she made at Bertholdt, but she does have a soft and vulnerable side which is shown when Eren was kidnapped and her confession to Eren during episode 12 is probably one of the most saddening cute scenes I've seen, Armin doesn't really do anything different than he usually does as he continues to do smart things although there was one moment when he was talking to Bertholdt that really made him look insane which definitely upped his creepy badass side.
Reiner and Bertholdt obviously get a lot of screentime considering their true identities are revealed, but even thought they are the enemies that destroyed Shiganshina and killed countless other people I didn't hate them as they were just people that were forced into doing this or that's what they say, Reiner definitely seemed the more agitated since his disguise personality and real personality were in conflict with each other making it difficult for him to make decisions while Bertholdt actually says his genuine feelings of what the other cadet members were to him.
Krista and Ymir also get a lot more screentime too as it is revealed that Ymir is a titan who was forced into becoming one which shows she isn't from the walled society and is from where Reiner and Bertholdt came from, but it really shows how bad her life has been and why she doesn't really trust anyone other than herself which makes you feel bad for her and Krista is actually revealed to be Historia who actually has big connections with the titans that are within the walls, but you also see the difficult position her character is in and you see her get stronger by the end of the series as she finally knows who she wants to be.
Sasha and Connie even get their moments as we see what background Sasha is from and really shows her badass side by taking on a titan with nothing but a bow and some arrows and really shows the strength her character can provide while Connie stumbles on the true revelation of the origin of the titans as he discovers his entire village has been destroyed yet no one has been killed which points to the biggest question about the origin of the titans.
Hannes even gets some more screentime and his time in the series shows how much of an important person he was to Eren, Mikasa and Armin when they were kids so seeing him get killed was actually pretty sad to see.
Even Hange gets a little more screentime as we get to see her leadership skills and why you shouldn't piss her off as was shown at the beginning of episode 1.
The artstyle while was still good even brilliant in some areas you can definitely see why it was a struggle to make a second season like the way the Colossal titan looked when Bertholdt transformed it just looked like bad CGI and even the horse animations looked pretty bad too, luckily when it was more tense and hectic moments like when Eren was fighting Reiner in their titan forms or the massacre that was happening towards the end of season 2 were just great visual moments.
The music too continued to be amazing as the new opening is just as epic if not better than the first opening from season 1 and the soundtrack was on point especially during the Armoured and Colossal titan transformation scene.
The action was just amazing as we finally got to see Eren and Reiner duke it out in their titan forms and that fight scene was just epic here I was expecting Eren to get his ass kicked yet he managed to overpower Reiner until Bertholdt intervened, then there was the chase scene and the final massacre scene that were just fantastic, just when you think everyone was going to bite the dust Eren somehow unleashes his secret hidden power that just kicked absolute ass, the name for this arc which is Clash of the Titans definitely fits with this season.
There was quite a lot of drama too as the conversation between Eren, Reiner, Bertholdt and Ymir was certainly something as we finally get to see Eren unleash his rage on the people who murdered his mother and many other people was just incredible to witness and then there's the other deaths that happen in this season although not as bad as season 1 there are some significant people who did die like Hannes, Mike and even Erwin almost died luckily he just lose his right arm, but it was close and then there is those few sentimental moments like Hannes telling Mikasa and Armin that Eren is very stubborn and that they shouldn't worry about him or when Mikasa confessed her feelings to Eren which is another scene that has become one of my favourites.
Overall this was a fantastic sequel and it gives me a lot of hope for season 3 especially since it'll be the season that'll answer almost all of our questions.",10
"
                First things first. My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.
------
✦Story
So story goes on and to be blatant, it has so much less impact and ""moments"" than the first season. I found the usage of flashbacks being in this specific Anime, quite horrid. I get their point, but I feel they could really done those moments so much better. Another issue I have with the story is that felt oddly compulsive, random, lack of impact, weaker presentation, weaker emotion deliverance, whereas the whole method and conveyance of mystery and chaos felt quite pathetic. On top of that
                  action was quite satisfying.
Even though this season did have fair amount of moments that should have been so powerful and emotional. Yet still, somehow they felt weak.
As whole story is still good. We got some new answers and questions. Losses and wins. As well this season gave as a quite obvious gist regarding the titans and where it all might lead. Some moments were quite sweet, yet this season was filled with so much more darkness than joyful occasions. 
I can't go in depth and quite a lot would spoil all sorts of element of surprise, emotion or simply discovery. But to sum up, the story is good, but feels so much inferior to season 1 in the terms of presentation.
✦Art & Sound
Well, good as always. Got style and music got presence.
Yet, the lack of impact for visual stimuli, was a letdown. Same similar story with OST, it simply didn't give the emotion of surprise and power. No ""woaah...""
✦Enjoyment & Overall
Considering I rated S1 9 and and seen it maybe 3 times in total? Now that I finally reached S2 it felt like watching another Anime. As I mentioned everywhere in this review that the stimulation, impact and power felt really weak.
But that doesn't mean i didn't enjoy it. That's not the case, it's still good Anime and very enjoyable to watch plus had fair amount of ""moments"". But as ""whole"" and in comparison to S1, it is simply weaker.
To sum it up, good Anime with interesting story and discovery, but weak sequel.",7
"
                <Potential Spoilers>
It took a fair bit of time for this season to come out.
This had something to do with troubles of manga or the author but regardless of the reason. It resulted in the hype for Attack on Titan to die out until the trailer for season 4 released. Despite the short 12 episode run, the season had amazing plot points, sound design that is somehow better then the first season. The return of Wit studios top tier animation and the best character arcs in the series.
This season allowed for us to focus more on building the characters that had a very minor presence in
                  the first season. Krista and Ymir have an entire arc together where they both decide to live for themselves and not for other people who hate them. The set of episodes where they are surrounded in a abandoned castle, was one of the highlights. You could make a fat list of all the highlights in the series. Such as, the big reveal, Krista’s identity, Ymir’s identity, The clash between Eren and Reiner, etc. This season definitely had the same themes as the first season, the horror of war and sacrifice. But the second season focused more on world building and character exploration. Something I’m truely grateful was the main focus of the story.
The soundtrack somehow managed to improve from the first season. While the sound effects haven’t improved much, they’re still good. But the soundtrack is where this second season is a major improvement upon the first season. I mean, they must’ve been good if fans were sending death threats because the music wasn’t used in the latest season. But as a whole, the soundtrack was a major improvement. The music feels weirdly modern and tech like yet fits the medieval world of this anime perfectly. It conveys both the world and evokes the mood of any scene perfectly. The music during the “big reveal” was easily the highlight of where music is the backbone of emotion. Anyone who’s seen the anime knows exactly what I’m talking about. And don’t even get me started on the opening, the opening has become iconic and is something I can listen to and I doubt would ever get old.
The animation has improved for the most part. Wit studios are extremely talented and experienced with animation. That talent is present throughout the entirety of this second season. Characters blend well with the characters characters environment, characters movement is realistic and smooth, the environments are beautiful, etc. The animation of the ODMG is smooth and satisfying. And the Titan battles are vastly more intense. As we are no longer facing against pure titans. We’re fighting Titan shifters. The battles between Titan shifters are brutal and the animation doesn’t feel weird. As animating two titans, you would have to consider the physics and the way that titans of that size would move. Titan shifters are animated in a way that takes into consideration that giant moving bodies will move in a way that isn’t weird or unrealistic. However, the CGI of the colossal Titan does look weird. The colossal Titan has a weird combination of cgi and 2d animation that blends so poorly with the environment that it doesn’t even feel like it’s apart of the world.
Season 2 allows for many characters who were presented in the first season to be built up upon. Characters like Sasha, Ymir, Krista, Reiner, Bertholdt and Connie. They are all given more backstory and character significance. Ymir and Krista’s relationship has a major significance that allows for Krista to grow and sets her up for a bigger role. Bertholdt, Ymir, and Reiner allowed for more world building. Their characters answered many of questions of the first season but also created more questions like where do they come from, where is there home? Reiner feels like a genuine person with guilt and his character is far more complex then the strong brute that he was portrayed as in the first season. Sasha is also given time to build her character, as she manages to take on a Titan without any ODMG while also saving a girl. Sasha is given a backstory about living in the wild. This addition of a backstory and her demonstration of fighting spirit instantly made her character so much better.
Despite the short run of episodes, the improved narrative, soundtrack, animation and characters all made this one of the best seasons in Attack on Titan.
Overall, I rank this 8/10.",8
"
                It had Really good looking fight scenes, the CG wasn´t half bad and the opening and ending were better than the first season but, my only complaint is of the writing. They gave way too many hints towards what the beast titan´s ability is but none of the characters figured it out. If they want to make some characters seem smart, they should either have them figure out that the titan can transform humans into titans, or they should just give less hints because to me... it seemed like even a child could solve the mystery with so many clues.
              ",8
"
                Def the weakest season in the series. While it kicks off at a pace so fast that the plot literally starts before the end of season 1, it kind of grinds to a halt quickly. Sure it's cool that there's a few eps filling out minor characters, but I don't think you have to sacrifice plot development to do this. Season 2 disagrees.
While the first arc develops the show's mystery by going ""hey check this thing out, that's weird huh?"", the second arc does what the show does best: answering questions you wanted to know with more confusing questions until you're just sitting there like
                  ""wtf is going on"" and then a bunch of big dudes punch each other in the face.
The season worked a lot better for me on my second watch. Scenes have a lot more weight when you actually understand the importance of the info they're dumping on you. It's also a good fun time to try and catch the five Hundred billion little details they put in that foreshadow future plot points.",7
"
                It's good if you are binging from Season 1 in one sitting tbh
If you're not, it just feels like a very, very long Chapter 2 of a book lol 
[The opening song and animation is really nice :)]
I initially liked the Season 1 of Shingeki no Kyojin when it was airing back then because obviously it had a very odd theme that I haven't even heard or thought of that could be presented in an anime. This season, however, ALTHOUGH may be necessary for plot development, feels very ehhh at best.
I spent AT LEAST half of the anime (so 6 episodes) frustrated with how Eren,
                  our glorified main character, is reacting to the issues and challenges set before them, so if you happen to be like me, this is a BIG warning that you won't feel THAT happy, and enjoy watching this season in particular.
But at least now we know a certain extent about titans. I'm hoping that they finally get to make big steps towards what actually went down when the wall got broken down, and why it happened in the first place.",7
"
                The first season made for some of the most interesting developments in anime history,  but where the story has gone has ruined the initial excitement and mystique of Shingeki no Kyojin. 
Eren has all the trappings of a basic shounen protagonist with no real subversiveness or uniqueness to his role. Mikasa is dull. Obviously, she still needs to be developed more, which I suppose second season is doing, but i just feel like it's doing a really bad job at it.
Mikasa has more facial expressions it seems now than first season. However, it seems as though the drawers are content with her facial expressions
                  being enough to convince us she has turned into a full, emotional character who has really made any real development or progress. Despite making some progress with her character, she still hasn't quite hit the third dimension. Her character hasn't committed any action to show for her development or her changing. All the show has done is have the characters reflect on their past, but again, that isn't development. More things are being revealed, but the story isn't taking those flashbacks or insights into the past to progress characters. It's merely using it to unfold the plot; and unfortunately, that's not enough to make a viewer care. 
I hope the third season proves different and better than the second.",6
"
                Incredibly consistent throughout with an amazing finish, manages to ride on the first season's momentum and builds it up even more leading up to the explosive final episodes. 
OP and ED are amazing as well, with the latter being one of my fave AoT tracks. The ED's foreshadowing and visuals paired up with the melancholic music made me fall in love on the first viewing.
The Colossus CGI can be a bit distracting but you'll get so caught up with the story that it doesn't even matter.
This is Attack on Titan on it's peak and will remain as the best season for me.",9
"
                Season two is a good continuation of Attack on Titan. If you liked season one, watching season 2 is a no-brainer.
Story: 7
Still mysterious and interesting. Unfortunately the popularity of this show affected its pacing. the two minute previous episode recap and freeze frame reveal moments before title cards were somewhat annoying. I especially got annoyed by all the big reveals and exciting moments that were followed by a ""2 hours before"" or ""3 days before"" where everything was explained, but the viewer was left in the dark to artificially create suspense. 
Art: 9
All the stylistic horror and beautiful animation you are familiar with from season
                  one. Only complaint I had was the 3d animation Colossal Titan.
Sound: 7
The voice acting of characters is incredible (especially Eren in the final episode, wow). The soundtrack matches the emotion of each scene very well, but the non-stop techno warbling got old relatively fast.
Character: 7
Builds up new characters well, but screen time is taken away from characters I personally find more interesting.
Enjoyment: 7
I still love the stylistic horror of this series. It's definitely edgy and features an excessive amount of gore and blood, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The mystery aspects of this season felt too drawn out and vague as a couple of big questions were answered, but the other answers were so blatantly danced around it was hard to not feel cheated.
Overall: 7
If you liked season one, you'll like it. Just don't expect all your questions to be answered or for it to wrap up in any way.",7
"
                Just finished watching the season. Actually I started watching attack on Titan a long time ago but dropped it for a while, maybe because I didn't find it interesting enough. But actually watching it properly made me realise this anime is a real bomb. I can't help but scream sometimes when someone dies or cheer on for the characters when they're fighting. It's really an anime that makes your emotions run wild. I'll probably be  finishing all of the series before I can start studying properly. Ahhhhhhh!!! 
I need to quickly get this done and start studying. This is too addictive!!! :@@@

"
                Maybe it's because I read the manga in between season 1 and this, or maybe this season is just better than the previous one, but I liked this season more than season one. The story in this builds upon what was established in the previous season, delving more into the titan shifters which I really enjoyed since their my favorite part of Attack On Titan. The story is quite straightforward in this season, but I really enjoy that. The story here gets a 7/10.
Moving on to the art, it's as great as it was last season. The characters all look distinctive and are very expressive.
                  The new titans introduced look very unique and threatening. Even some of the normal titans look legitimately creepy. 8/10 for this category.
I watched the sub for this season, rather than the dub like I did last season and it is SO much better. The Japanese VAs sound way better and more fitting than the English ones did. The music in this season is also just as great, if not even better than it was last season. The OP in particular beats out the previous two, and is something I have listened to on repeat for hours. 10/10 for the sound.
Now onto the characters, which were a real problem for me in the first season. Eren, doesn't show up much during the first half of this season (something I was not opposed to), but when he did appear, and in the second half when the story revolved around him again, I found myself actually liking his character. Maybe it's just the Japanese VA, or maybe it's just that he's actually competent. Mikasa is just as she was in the first season, only caring about Eren, but she is relegated to a minor role this season, which I was fine with. Armin was also relegated to a minor role, but I also found him to be a lot less whiny than he was in the first season. There was also a big spotlight on character who were really only minor characters in the first season, such as Connie, Reiner, Bertholdt, Krista and Ymir, all of whom I found to be great characters, or at least way better than Eren, Armin or Mikasa were in the first season. Overall, the characters were an improvement on the first season, 7/10.
I really enjoyed this season of Attack On Titan, way more than the first. The actions scenes are really exciting and the big reveals this season are done very well. Every week, I was excited for the next episodes and to see some of my favorite parts of the manga adapted to animation. I give this a 9/10 for enjoyment and this season gets a 8/10 overall. I can't wait for season 3 next year!",8
"
                Shingeki no Kyojin is one those success that I really don't understand. I feel like it is popular only because it is ruthless with its characters (which I also enjoy).
But aside from that, this anime (along with its original manga) is full of flaws which I simply can't ignore.
STORY
The story keeps changing its course. It first starts as a fight for survival, as the rest of humanity has been surrounded by cruel Titans. They can live only thanks to miraculous walls, but even these can't stand forever.
But then, the MC, Eren, suddenly gets the power of a powerful Titan ; the story then becomes a
                  fight to rescue the princess (because yes, Eren is like Princess Peach : he keeps getting abducted and the others have to save him).
And now in the manga, the story changed its course again...
This is the very first problem of the story of SNK. But this is not the worst.
Then, there is the narration. There are WAYS to tell a story. For example, when you start a plot, you don't press pause on it for an entire season. Or, when you use flashbacks or timelapses, you don't do it just randomly.
Basically, there are some mistakes to avoid so that the told story doesn't come out as confuse and out of the place. Sadly, SNK made ALL of those mistakes. Flashbacks and timelapses are used randomly. Many plots are left aside for a while (hey, remember Annie?). Revelations are not put in evidence.
In the end, this is the true face of SNK : a confused story which keeps changing its course and is narrated in the most horrendous way (=randomly).
ART
On this point, there would be a lot to tell.
- First, the environments are stunning. Probably the best we can see in current anime.
- Too bad the environments are not what we focus on. The focus is on the characters, and sadly, the chara-design is horrendous. The outline is TOTALLY IRREGULAR, as if the characters were cut and paste by 5-years old. This really destroys the visuals, as it feels more like characters paste ON the environment instead of characters INSIDE the said environment. Basically, that one problem destroys the immersion.
- Then, the light effects are awesome, nothing to blame here.
- Finally, the animation is on top! The action scenes are great... BUT... way too rare. And this is the main problem in the whole anime industry : most of the time, when the animation is great, there are actually VERY FEW animated scenes. SNK is no exception, as we have to wait for 5 episodes to get 5 minutes of awesome fights. The rest is almost just still pictures.
Overall, the light effects and environments are stunning, but the rest is full of flaws.
SOUND
The OST is great, and the openings are legendary.
CHARACTER
This is by far the worst aspect of this anime. The characters have barely known any sort of progress except for Eren which does get through a lot of different emotional states. The rest is just blend.
Mikasa and Livai are often treated as awesome, but let's be honest : their ONLY trait is that they're badass. Aside from that, they're empty OP characters. Mikasa even gets annoying with all her ""Eren! Eren! Eren!"".
ENJOYMENT
I'm sure many people think I overreacted. That may be true, but for my defense, they themselves have also overreacted. SNK is nothing special. Its being ruthless is great, but it is so full of flaws that we can't simply ignore. The story is a huge mess and the chara-design is terrible.
I don't understand how it could be so popular except for the constant violence.",3
"
                The second season of Attack On Titan goes up and down like a rollercoaster; not just in terms of story but also quality. 
The story of the original season began with titans breaching Wall Maria, and the second season opens with a mirroring storyline about titans appearing within the confines of Wall Rose, and the Survey Corps are forced to investigate the breach.
And that's far from the only similarity between the seasons. While Studio Wit bizarrely waited four years before attempting to follow up on their incredible success with the first season, the second season turns out to follow quite closely in its predecessor's footsteps.
                  The strengths and weaknesses of the second season feels largely similar to the first (with perhaps a couple of major differences which I'll elaborate on later), so anyone familiar with the first should be able to guess pretty much what they're getting into here.
I'd rate the first few episodes to be pretty middle of the pack compared to the first season - mostly very good with the occasional wow moment thrown in. I was expecting it to get better as the story gains momentum but instead it gradually began feeling formulaic and actually started to lose steam. Half way through the season, the series drops what was for me an incredibly stupid twist that brought the franchise to a level that's easily as low as it's ever been. This was followed by a few pedestrian episodes which did little to improve the situation. However, the season then finishes on three immense episodes which salvages it at the end.
Apart from the twist that I found incredulous, the major differences seem to stem from single cour nature of Attack On Titan 2. While I thought the first season had pretty great pacing, I can't say the same for the second. There's just so much going on in this short season, and the solution Attack On Titan 2 relies on over and over again to compress the narrative into the time available is flashbacks. There are loads of plot points coming into fruition and they need to happen in a certain order in order to make sense, but the timing also needs to be impactful, so the anime solves this by using just-in-time flashbacks to drop the important reveals straight into the places where the information is required. There are also previously neglected characters that needs to moving into the spotlight due to the requirements of the plot, and again, the anime reaches for the flashback button to crowbar in a backstory or two for some quick and dirty character building. I'm not saying the technique can't be effective, but when it's over used and in this kind of hurried manner the story telling can feel too artificial and it leads to the formulaic feeling I complained about earlier. 
Given the tight time frame the Attack In Titan 2 is trying to fit everything into, it's a bit strange the second half also had a couple of episodes where it felt like it was stalling for time. Perhaps it's a side effect of trying to time the climactic last few episodes right. The pacing even affected some pretty good Titan UFC action which would have been even better if the flashbacks hadn't put a drag on the action.
Still, it has to be said that the second season covered a lot of ground in terms of plot. While more mysteries have presented themselves, I feel like franchise is either reaching or has reached a tipping point where it no longer feels like each reveal raises at least two more questions. A couple of notable movers in the character stocks are Erwin and Eren. Erwin's has risen thanks to some incredible badassery, but Eren's has fallen in my estimation: he displayed moments of great emotional depth, but there were also times when every one of his lines in a stretch of dialogue would be delivered in a monotonous, outraged screech, which made him annoying (more than usual, I should say).
The music is as great as ever. I'm impressed by how the creators managed to consistently find catchy, energetic, hot-blooded opening anthems that you can easily identify as coming from the same show. The opening animation gets a little strange at one point as the screen fills up with a bizarre stampede of animals including (but not limited to) an elephant, a giraffe, a gorilla, and even at least one dinosaur and a fricking WHALE! What all this means I have no idea, but I can testify that only the gorilla turns up this season, and a part of me hopes we'll see the whale flopping along in a later one. The ending is rather experimental and features what sounds like a chorus of zergling and ultimately doesn't quite work.
That's pretty much all I have to say about season 2.
Personal rating: +1.5 (very good)",8

                this is going to be short and straight around the point,
a lot of people worship this anime and think it's a masterpiece, while others think it's overrated. the truth is it's both.
so what makes an anime or any kind of art a masterpiece ? well, i don't know and i don't think anybody really knows, but what i do know is, everybody thinks there is  something special about Shingeki no Kyojin, except me.
there is no denying the art is top notch, the music fits in perfectly too, the characters development is outstanding for most parts, i can go on for hours about how good
                  it is. but what is it missing? why does it feel like I'm being played for a fool when i watch it?    
well after a few smokes i think i figured it out : 
i have seen this anime a few times in the last few years and dozens just like it, not as good of course,but it's just a mystery that goes nowhere, a hot overpowered chick with no real personality, a stupid hotheaded MC,some cool gadgets and a ''levi'' in other words a cool  side character that everyone admires but useless like ""gildarts"" or ""shanks"" etc.
what do you get when the best professionals in the industry combine all these things perfectly and more ? an overrated anime that looks like a masterpiece. tricky huh ?
so do i recommend it ? hell yes it's awesome, is it the best anime ever ? don't make me laugh it's not even close.",8

"
                     Attack On Titan season 1 was a hard flop, and I was worried going into season 2, but I can say now that I wasn’t entirely disappointed. The main characters were bland and uninteresting in season 1 and it carried on in season 2. Another thing that pissed me off is how Erren gained a powerup as he was about to get killed, there is NOTHING wrong with power-ups, but the fact that he was about to die and got a powerup to save his ass is so unrewarding and bullshit. The side characters on the other hand were given
                  a lot of much-needed screen time and depth that made you see through their point of view in this crazy world. I wish there was a lot more build-up to the reveal of the armored and colossal titan.
      The story was disjointed and messy, they had no clue what they wanted to do, at least season 1 had a straightforward and stable story. The world-building is actually amazing, it makes the immersive world even more immersive. The soundtrack is great just like it was in the first season no complaints there, the same can be said for the art and animation.",6
"
                After a long 4 years, Attack on Titan season 2 finally arrived. WIT Studio took their time and didn't rush production. They crafted yet another masterful season to follow the 25 episode marvel of season 1. You already know the story, so i'll get right into my review.
Story (10/10)
AOT season 2 doesn't waste time recapping the first season, instead it starts right where we left off after defeating The Female Titan. The main focus of the first season was world building and developing our main trio. It established the mysteries that would slowly be unraveled throughout the entire show. The second season doesn't solve many
                  mysteries, but instead it reveals even bigger twists and turns then the first season. It also develops the supporting characters. Which was necessary to create a stronger connection and understanding of them. They do a fantastic job at developing as much as they do in the short run time of the season, but not every character gets time to shine. I was sad to see Levi didn't get much time. 
The season was only 12 episodes, and the pacing was very good. Obviously it didn't have the same amount of action as season 1, but every action scene in this season was well done and felt like it mattered. They built to every battle without sacrificing the development of the main story. Another remarkable thing about Attack on Titan is the foreshadowing of certain events, reveals, or big moments. I didn't really notice just how well the show put together the story until i rewatched scenes from the first season. Very smart writing on the authors behalf.
Art (10/10)
The art style remains tremendous. The world still looks beautiful. I can't get over just how well everything is designed. The action scenes are extremely dynamic and wonderfully constructed. There's only a few shots that look a bit clunky, such as the CGI Colossal Titan. Overall the art and animation remained strong throughout the season.
Sound (10/10)
Attack on Titan is known for it's A grade production quality, and the show wouldn't be complete without it's outstanding soundtrack. One of my favorite aspects from the first season was the music, and there's plenty of great music in this season as well. Linked Horizon yet again performs the opening theme, although it's not nearly as strong as the previous OP's of the show. The more i listened to it, the more it grew on me. It's a great piece of music. The ED isn't amazing, but it's good. The strength of the soundtrack isn't the OP or ED, it's the orchestral pieces and how well the music amplifies the powerful moments of the show. Beautiful tracks such as ""Call of Silence"" and the masterful ""YouSeeBIGGIRL"" are perfectly used. Just watch the iconic Colossal and Armored Titan reveal. The use of music was gorgeous. Hiroyuki Sawano has proven time and time again that he's one of anime's finest composers.
Finally, the Japanese voice cast fit the characters like a silk glove. Characters like Ymir, Reiner, Bertholdt, Krista, and Erwin are brought to life wonderfully by the superb voice acting. Yuki Kaji remains a tour de force as Eren. His voice acting during the episode ""Scream"" is nothing short of phenomenal.
Character (10/10)
Another strong point of Attack on Titan is the variety of character. This season dedicates the majority of it's time developing it's supporting cast. Sasha, Reiner, Bertholdt, Krista and Ymir get a lot of characterization which we didn't see in the first season. The main trio is barely seen through the first half of the season, but the second half gives more insight into their relationship together. I love how we see multiple perspectives on the world instead of the same old thing from Eren. We see several motivations and perspectives from different characters, and it's much more complicated then the usual villain/hero dynamic. Attack on Titan allows us to empathize with both sides.
Conclusion (10/10)
Another season, another incredible experience. You could talk about amazing technical qualities and production value all day, but none of it would click if you didn't have the ""it"" factor bringing it all together. This anime has it. I just love watching the show. It's exciting, it's emotional, and i couldn't wait to watch the next episode. The show shines all across the board. Whether it was an epic battle, a heartfelt moment, a plot twist i never saw coming, or an exciting cliffhanger, Attack on Titan got me hyped. Once the final season is completed, this show will reach legendary status. I can't argue with that.",10
"
                I loved season 1 but season 2 of Attack on titan was really bad. I do not recommend anyone wasting time watching season 2. 
I was always waiting for the hype of Eren that never came. 
The season was just about some drama/lesbian love romance that never came to anything. The intro was showing monsters that never came in the season and compared to season 1 that I would give 9/10, I give this season 2/10 score because it just sucked.
I think the makers of Attack on titan should try to improve the story, not making the story about some new lesbian characters.
My season 2
                  expectations were that it would be very dark and about surviving in a unknown world of titans, were Eren would play the main role and try to save his friends by fighting off titans from other parts of the world and gain more power, getting more clues about what is actually happening in that world and how mankind will survive.",2
"
                Being someone who actually kind of liked the live action movies, it was simply impossible for me not to like the actual thing. One thing that Attack on Titan has it going for it is the whole mythology behind the main plot. There is a huge base of information layered down so that the actual story to flourish. Plus, the action scenes are enough to keep it interesting till the very ending. Another plus was the fact that some episodes could keep you at the edge of your seat, like when that female titan appeared. You just want to keep watching. To both of them,
                  the soundtrack helped a lot, especially the opening theme, building up the mood for something epic. Finally, the characters were really likable and you couldn't help but sympathise with all of them. And now the negative points. Season one had some boring episodes, but fortunately, season two had just some boring parts here and there. However, season two had less episodes with the main characters, which was kind of annoying. You want to see Eren more than just a few seconds in an episode. But that's just me. Also, the art kind of didn't settle with me. Mikasa looked like the male characters, only with the addition of long hair. But, in the action scenes they did a great job, so at least that worked. Also, the titans got worse in season two, weirder in a way, but that could have been just a story thing. So, overall, 8 out of 10.",8
"
                This season had a very different feel to it compared to the first season. Overall I really enjoyed it, but if I'm being honest I found the lack of information about anything that was happening to be a bit annoying. We get winks and nods to what the titans might actually be, where they're coming from, and what's actually going on, but in reality we really don't learn that much. 
Despite that this season is immensely entertaining. The intense feeling of being trapped which pervaded the first season was lost a little bit this season. It wasn't as horrific either. Rather this season focused a
                  whole lot more on the side characters, which I didn't mind that much. I was honestly pleasantly surprised to see that the show was able to make the audience feel at least a little sympathetic toward the antagonists, no matter how abstract it might've been.
I personally really enjoyed the main characters as well. I don't find their lack of overtly obvious character arcs to be that detrimental. Watching these character overcome all these insanely complicated obstacles is pretty interesting in it of itself to me at least. And I think the scale of this show gives it some leeway in that regard.
Once again the animation is as good as ever. There are moments where the animators and directors just let loose with the action sequences and its so fun to watch. They frame them in super engaging ways, making this show really unique.
Overall, great follow-up to the last season. My only complaint really is that everyone is still mostly in the dark about everything that's going on. Can't wait to start the next season.",9
"
                this is peak attack on titan! literally mind-blowing. still people are hating this. second season is the best of attack on titan. Now I think I am just blabbing and not giving a reason, so let's get to why.
everything. yeah, EVERYTHING! it had a ton of shocking reveals which's execution was on another level. every reveal has great animation and epic as hell music. story progression was good and the some reveals had emotional weight. conversations of former friends were heart breaking knowing that they worked side by side.
we got new and more epic soundtracks which fit the environment. animation was better the previous season.
                  those characters which had no importance became more significant. characters  like Connie, Sasha, Erwin and Jean had their moments. Others like Historia, Reiner and Bertholdt became a significant part of the plot.",10
"
                In this season of Titan Gear, Erwin, after showing off the Magnum opus of his war criminal career, decided to start sacrificing bits of himself for a change, while still slaughtering dozens of other people, tall people are secretly keeping society together, monkeys are stronger than dogs, you can have sex with a wall, Connie's mom is an exhibitionist, Reiner spoiled major plot points so hard Eren learned how to cyberbully and cancel people by accident, and Levi learns that he won't get away with mass murder just because of a height difference. The law should really be more clear in this matter.
Also, the plot
                  continues. Y'know, just a normal day when you're caught between the biggest threat to humanity, who killed people in the thousands and doesn't even look close to be done, and the titans. 
Can't wait for the reveal that Erwin was the bad guy all along and created the titans because he wanted to blur the meaning of war crimes.
Other than these small happenings, and despite the fact that it's probably the only sequel which isn't noticeably worse --Boruto and The Promised Neverland Season 2 say hi-- and even marginally better than its prequel but still stands below.
A marginal improvement because the small flaws present in the first season aren't as overbearing in this one. Things like the overreaction to trauma (shit, Reiner became schizophrenic from this shit), like, I know war is a big deal and the main characters are teenagers but they're supposed to have lived in this pain, so their emotions do feel a bit exaggerated.
Although the trade off is that you notice the fact that their training as tall people murderer wasn't covered nearly enough, so the events happening don't hit as hard as they should. Or maybe I'm just a psychopath, after all, I respect Erwin for that war crimillionaire grindset.
A solid show, and I don't say that because I'm 5'10 and really enjoy seeing the deaths of tall people.",9
"
                WHOA, what just happened?! I cannot believe that I didn't suspect [PROHIBITED] and [PROHIBITED] being [PROHIBITED]! Like, what?! Such a loophole Ive been thrown in with this and the fact that THAT happened, I'm in a loss of words. I'm giving this season another 10/10, after the realization of what had happened. This season managed to keep my attention as much as the first one did, making this a great choice for a 10/10. 
More calm approach on this review:
The beauty of this season is the way they've managed to mix all the needed things for a 10/10 anime, alongside the plot twists and the
                  other important things. The animation from Wit Studio is truly unique and I fell in love the moment I saw it.",10
"
                It took way too long for the second season of Attack on Titan to come out. So long that it lost the mainstream fan base that it had. Only the true fans really watched season two, and those fans were divided. They all like both seasons, but you either like season one better or two better.
Personally, I am a season two guy. It took the action show and made it into a horror/mystery while still keeping the amazing action animation. It also adds so much character depth through things like backstory and some... Really shocking reveals. It even manages to feel more epic in scope
                  than season one did, even though there isn't as much action or as many episodes. I love this season. It made a above-average action show, into one of my favorites that I think everyone should watch. Even though, not as many people watched it.",10
"
                Shingeki no Kyojin is a very popular anime and manga series about the survey corps that alongside humanity want to once and for all finish with the giants.
The story is basically the writer trying to add more depth to some characters with more pasts and secrets, they fight a bit more and go on some sort of expedition if you wish to call it that.
Pretty simple but as impressive as season 1's, 8/10 just a bit more boring.
The art is like in season 1 quite good, it is constantly great, everything looks so cinematic and good. 9/10
Sound, the opening is ""Shinzou wo Sasageyo!"", very good
                  opening. 9/10 the song is good, it fits the series as much as you can imagine and it looks great. The ending iis ""Yuugure no Tori"", melody is similar, they all got that kind of rustic..well the perfect way to explain it is to call it Attack on Titan, it is just unique. Okay song, nice and calm. 7.5/10, the sound is an 8. Good opening and average ending.
The characters are still quite complex with all sorts of personalities and looks, we got both genders and all kinds of personalities, some are strong, others are weak, others are shy and others are foolish. Eren is an okay main character and we get quite some fine waifus, Mikasa is a 9 and well the rest are around 8 or 7 with the sole exception of Hange Zoe who is a 9 as well. Complex and interesting characters, quite relatable. 9/10
Season 2 did not fail to get my attention or make me have a fun time like season 1 did, consistently good. My apologies for a rather short review but there are not that many differences,they are building on top of what season 1 did with extra story and depth. Quite good. 8/10",8

"
                Once again, I am going all out to bash a popular anime, just like how I did with Re:Zero. (evil laughter)
Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2, the sequel that managed to throw everything built up in season 1 into the trash bin.
In season 1, we are presented with the idea of ""kyojins are sent down from the heavens to punish us for our sins"", and how humans sacrificed so much just to fight them back. After 25 episodes of epic-flying-all-over-the-place-like-spiderman-to-snipe-a-titan's-nape and hearing Eren screaming in almost every episode, we are finally presented with a very short and simple statement that summarizes season 1 in the best
                  way ever, ""Eren can become a titan"". Full stop. That's all you need to know about season 1, really.
Continuing the trend of spiderman-wannabe-titan-slaying-technique-oh-no-he-grabbed-me-and-now-i-am-dead and more throat-busting yells from Eren, we are given the 12-episode sequel. Again, a very short and simple statement can summarize the entire season, and it's freaking hilarious that I can't help myself but laugh at how stupid the buildup is.
""Everyone's a titan!!""
So after spending the entirety of season 1 trapped behind walls, our dear humans, the elite of the elite, finally realized that they were mass murderers! Humans vs humans! Oh isn't it great!
How can the truth be hidden for so long from even the ""strongest person in the world"" is truly baffling. In the real world, the military can easily overthrow the government that relies on nothing but religion. But in the world of Shingeki no Kyojin, yes, the church rules of the entire world, and the superhuman soldiers that can fly around like spiderman had been obeying them for who knows how many years. 
Forgive my insolence, but this, is extremely stupid. What governed the country is a bunch of religious old farts that has no means to protect themselves other than deceiving the only people (soldiers) that are capable to protect them. They would rather die protecting the secret and not for the sake of humanity. It’s a blatant lose-lose situation for the old farts, but anyway, something’s been tying their hands at their back.
That is what manga readers had been telling us the whole time, “there’s a lot more going on! There’s a lot more that you don’t know!” Okay, I won’t say I won’t buy this one, but for pure anime viewers, what we had been getting, is just a super-hot blooded action-pumped show that has actually makes zero sense. If anything, it’s a waste of our time. The whole season 1 is just a freaking huge introduction that the titans could be humans, which is proven in like, the minute Eren bites himself and goes all flashy and becomes a titan. Then, the 2nd season is another huge introduction that everyone is in fact, a titan, and we have some titans running another country, preparing for world war 3 in which the humans our protags are sided with, have totally no idea about anything except for the church’s old farts who only knew how to tremble in fear.
As much as a freaking huge mystery and conspiracy going on, I couldn’t fathom the fact they started the story that way. Surely there would be remnants of people who knew the truth of all things and are still alive and kicking and be living in the wall, don’t tell me they had all been reduced to old farts, or all of them had now become enemies trying to wipe out humanity. Now you see the problem? It doesn’t make any sense. Humans, trying to eradicate humans. Oh wait, let me rephrase that, humans, with abilities to turn into incredible hulks, wants to eradicate humans. Wait, that doesn’t sound too difficult to achieve, isn’t it? Imagine an army of hulks against the world, obviously the hulks would win, easily. 
Now to complicate matters, these titan-humans are perfectly human when they don’t turn huge! These chaps can easily blend in and live in an only-human society, fall in love with them, and easily forget the notion of trying to eradicating them. What’s the point wiping out a species when you can just live with them in peace? 
Enough with the convoluted plot, we move on to dissect the 2nd season further. First off, the stupid pacing at the first half of the show, where we are given ridiculous time-jumps just to highlight some events to “explain” why it happened, by explaining, I mean explaining the deus ex machina that happened, so that the viewers can be fooled that it isn’t a deus ex machina and is actually pre-planned or built up before it occurs. Bullshit, a good build up has no need of such cheap tricks to convince the viewers that it is good writing, what we get here, is a bunch of WTFs and a bunch of time-rewinding scenes to explain those WTFs. The writing is garbage. 
Presentation-wise, there’s no doubting that Shingeki no Kyojin is one of the higher-budget productions we have currently, with superb animation and epic soundtrack. 
I have major issues with the characters, MAJOR ISSUES. Everyone in SnK has mental problems! I am dead serious here. Eren only has fire in his head and the only thing he knows, is that he wants to kill all kyojins. Obviously he’s gonna get mindfucked, because kyojins are humans, so he wants to kill all humans! Yay! Suit yourself Eren. Mikasa, from season 1, we all know how much of a control freak she is, and how obsessive she is with Eren. All she wants is Eren, all she cares is Eren. Okay we get that he did great things in your past, but isn’t it pushing a little too far?
When it comes to love, people in SnK do not know how to express themselves, and become huge stalkers. Just ask Reiner and Ymir! Their overwhelming love towards Christa is simply sublime. Well to be fair to them, Christa is crafted to be the ultimate waifu material by the creators, she’s damn cute, she’s chibi, she’s very caring and loving like Mother Teresa, and most of all, she’s badass! Out of nowhere, she said she’s gained inner strength sufficient to kill titans in the most badass way that even Levi would be jelly about. I’ve never seen such blatant waifu material since Asuna and Rem. The moral of the day, all you need is the ultimate waifu material and you will have a very popular anime. Oh, husbandos work as well. 
By the way, why doesn’t Ymir’s other mode have tits? 
To be fair with the creators, we have yet progress the plot enough to know our major antagonists well. The only one we are presented seems to be the beast titan, which has a horrendous design, seriously. His head is as big as yours and mine, yet his entire body is as big as the colossal titan, with abs, prominent, protruding abs, in that flabby body of his. And freakishly long hands. Godzilla was a terrifying beast with a menacing look, but titans, beasts with a comical look, how can they be terrifying?? Gah, this had been one of my major issues with SnK since season 1 episode 1. If you are going to make a dark and suspenseful show, cut off all the lame jokes, proper jokes can be included as long as they do not intrude the overall theme and atmosphere of the story. Yet, over the course of 2 seasons, some titans have been elevated to meme status because how ridiculous they look. 
How exactly will the plot progress, the manga readers know, and the anime-only viewers will be stuck in darkness with only their wild imaginations and speculations to guide them.  
“We will run out of people before we know the truth.” This final quote from Levi cannot be any more fitting than how I feel how this plot will progress. The kyojin-less humans are in real deep shit right now, vastly overpowered in terms of power, and number as well from the look of things. To make things worse, the kyojin-humans now had infiltrated their ranks so well that they are extremely informative and knows every single nook and crook in the human military. Those old farts in the church better grow some balls or there will be no salvation to them. 
Well let’s just patiently wait for season 3, we all know how hyped it will get.",5
"
                Season 2 of Attack on Titan is great. Distant from the first season in many respects, but great on it's own.
Season 1 was a gory, action filled anime, with the constant plot twists, and many dramatic hero moments. This gave us expectations for the same idea in Season 2.
We did not receive that, and it is not a bad thing.
Season 2 was more darker, a mystery. It set up for the viewer to realize exactly how much of a disadvantage humanity faced against the Titans, and that the biggest threat to humanity might not even BE the Titans in the first place.
Season 1 was action.
                  A thriller. Season 2 is a horror story.
The seasons are two different genres, and season 2 takes a more attention. Is more to digest. For sure it has been a relatively quiet addition to the series, but it is definitely a positive one.",8
"
                Story 10/10
A great season with full on action as Eren and the scout regiment head out to defend humanity once again the story this season has plenty of action and twists and turns as a terrible betrayal is followed by a terrible but hopeful realization at the end of the season.
Art 9/10
I enjoyed the art style hear more with plenty of great artwork of the cities the action and the massive titans.
Sound 9/10High class OP some nice sound and some high quality voice acting.
Characters 9/10
Eren continues to improve as the MC maintaining his never say die attitude and his determination to defeat the titans, Mikasa continues to defend Eren at any cost having a couple of close shaves particularly when the great betrayal of this season occurs. We also find out more about the characters of the former 104th cadet corps with some characters being not what they may have appeared.
Enjoyment 9/10
An action packed series of episodes with not a single slow episode as we get drama, twists and turns and lots of entertainment as we get to learn a heck of lot more of the world of Attack on Titan.
Overall 9/10",9
"
                A sequel to a classic title among anime fans. This season provides at least some answers to the questions a viewer of the former season might've asked themselves. It also manages to develop previously omitted characters we've met along the first season, as well as develop relationships between them. Although I often found myself enjoying the show, mostly due to the fact that it's an another installment of Shingeki no Kyojin as a whole, it certainly lacks some qualities in comparison to the prequel. The story to me is pretty bland - it feels unnecessarily stretched out; the fights feel very cheesy, as the whole
                  concept behind them was used several times already (guess that's shonens for you, oh well). You don't really feel satisfied after watching the whole thing too, nor does the ending make you particularly want to watch the next season, like the first one did. In general, it's a not-so-ideal next part of SnK story. That's it.",8
"
                Oh my god, my god, this keeps getting better and better. How? How is it even possible? 
The first season was spectacular, and now this leaves me hanging for the third season like no other show ever did. The suspense, the development of the world-building and the story -- wow. just...... I've got no words. This show is amazing. I wasn't ever as involved as I am right now in any other anime - not even my favourites.
Story: 10. It provided the right amount of information, without getting too specific and saving it for the next season.
Art: 9. The art is just better than the
                  1st season - I love the clouds.
Sound: this opening!
Character: 10. The development is amazing.
Enjoyment: 10. I finished this in literally 2 days.
Overall: 9. I'm hesitant to give it a ten, I wanna see the other seasons first.",9
"
                I cannot comprehend how people felt when they first tuned into this second season of Shingeki no Kyojin, back after four years of absence. However, I can probably comprehend how they felt after finishing it. Based on my own experience, they probably felt...
...disappointment. Well, at least for 50% of the show.
Art: Same as Before/10- I guess it's bad that a show from 2017 looks no different than a show from four years ago (at least it's better than a CERTAIN show from this year that looks WORSE than a certain show from SEVEN years ago). But considering that WIT Studio has been famously in the
                  red since the first season, the fact they could even pull a single cour that looked this good out of their posteriors is nothing short of a miracle.
I still don't like the ""gorgeousness"" of the art from a thematic stand point (plus it makes some of the iconic scenes look like that of a melodramatic romance), but since I've found it so rare for anime to actually DELIVER in terms of visuals, I'll let it pass.
Sound: Same as Before/10- The music and voice acting is more or less the same. I rrrrrrrreally like the OP, Shinzou wo Sasageyo! In fact, I've listened to it dozens of times BEFORE ever watching this season and bought Linked Horizon's Shingeki no Kiseki album just for that track (it turns out that the album overall is pretty solid, I recommend giving it a listen). 
There were still some weird tracks that felt melodramatic, but most of the time it's the same old Catholic rock choir music from the first season.
Story: 8/10- This is the point in the story where things are meant to get hype. The first episode opens with a follow-up to the bombshell that's cliffhung us for four years at the end of last season, and the twists just keep piling and piling on up. We really start to push the issue of ""What the heck is going on?"" during this season.
But in exchange there isn't as much action. When there is action, this season DELIVERS with FREE SHIPPING, but like I said there isn't much. This doesn't really become an issue in terms with pacing except for episode 9, which is entirely spent talking and doing nothing.
However, my real issue is with episode 10. I know I'm not supposed to compare manga to anime, but I strongly believe that this difference is important to mention. Basically, half of episode 10 contains an anime original flashback sequence (I confirmed this by reading the wiki's synopsis of the corresponding chapter AND by physically skimming through the chapter again myself). The problem is that it discloses- with no form of subtlety- information that will not be revealed up late into Season 3 (assuming they'll adapt up to a specific story arc). It's not one of those things that makes sense after you already know the full story. Anyone who sees this sequence will be able to utilize the power of context clues to extrapolate information that isn't known until much later in the story, thus making the next season a slog of dramatic irony while the viewers wait for the characters to catch up to them.
Granted, it is a pretty minor thing. The series' premise lacks originality to where you probably already knew certain things going into it. But at that extent you would probably only be able to know the most bare-bones essential aspects of the plot, while that anime original flashback gives even MORE information that, again, was not disclosed in the corresponding point in the manga.
(I apologize if everything I said was, in fact, completely wrong and that I'm an idiot)
Characters: Where's Mah Boy Levi/10- As indicated by my very specific rating of the cast, Levi doesn't do much of anything this season. The main issue with this is that most fans love him to tears, so a lack of Levi will drive them to tears.
However we do get some good stuff from the other characters at least. I always liked Armin and Erwin, among others. We also get some character development on people who didn't really do anything last season. Eren is still... Eren, whoo-pee.
Overall: 8/10- This actually turned out to be a great second season of the show. But I doubt I'll be saying that for the next season. I still recommend reading the manga, if only to not have late-game content spoiled in an unsubtle fashion, but this season itself is as solid as the Armored Titan's, well, armor.",8
"
                Despite the engaging story, season 2’s mystery elements aren’t exactly difficult to decipher. It’s actually quite easy to piece certain pieces together. Every episode builds more and more into the story but some hints will be much more obvious than others. It leaves open to some predictable outcomes. However, I would also argue that season 2 succeeds at building up the suspense regardless how the outcome comes out to be. It injects psychology into the show through effective usage of narrative, dialogues, body language, and character interactions. In some of the later episodes, we can see how certain characters show their true selves in ways
                  that will be very memorable. It’s made even more effective through the timing of certain scenes. Directing a show like Shingeki no Kyojin requires a creative mind to connect the script and I have to say, it did that pretty damn well. Finally, I am satisfied by the faithfulness of the adaptation as it adapts many manga chapters that I had anticipated. In fact, some episodes are actually adapted even better than the manga thanks to the cleverly timings of key events.",10
"
                really fast season, but more and more mysteries are answered. The brutality in season 2 exceeds season 1 and it's disgusting and frightening, so you can imagine how the titan ate it. Sasageyo are words that I often heard back then and it turned out to be true, it was the opening of AOT S2, and it was one of the best openers. The more action tense and the animation the better, I love the music when it changes to titan. It was a bit bored at the beginning but the ending was perfect, giving a sneak peek for the next season.

                Attack on Titan (Season 2) Review:
The show starts off by placing you right into the action, exactly where you left off. There is no time for reviewing the characters that you once knew, or being filled in with the story line. This anime just GOES. 
The viewer is hard pressed for a breather during episodes. There is so much dramatic action and unanswered stories that you can't wait to figure out what the hell is going on. Each encounter is epic and each encounter reveals only a crumb of what is to come. In one word, the anime can be described as INTENSE.
Besides the action
                  scenes, certain characters have their back stories filled in, particularly ones that I thought I didn't care about. It turns out that they are actually important. Though on the flip side, certain characters quality through their overarching imbalanced sense of recklessness. The notch is turned up from 'subtle' to 'maniac' here, all for good reason, I suppose.
On to the ratings:
Story - 7 - I understand that Titans are taking over the city, but am not filled in with enough clues. Also, there was a certain disappointment at the ending that I will not share.
Graphics - 8 - Gory goulashes and bloody bleedings. The graphics are quite animated, with no complains.
Soundtrack - 9 - Chock full of high energy music to keep you on your seat.
Character personas - 7 - The main character decreased on quality, while the other characters sky rocketed. No complaints here due to the backstory of other characters, but it leaves me with a strange feeling to see the main character's persona treated this way.
Character voice actors - 8 - Plenty of screaming and intense rage coming from the characters. It's good to see them get into the moment, and certain characters really shine here. No complaints.
Overall - 8 - A quick 12 episodes
Recommended - If you are serious about this anime, then wait until Season 3 comes out. Too many questions left unanswered here in Season 2.",8
"
                For the sake of this review I'll pretend like i haven't read the manga yet so you scrubs can keep up :>
After four years we our wait has finally paid off as attack on titan season 2 finally rolled in. Honestly I have mixed feeling towards this season as one part of me wanted to scream ""YEAHHHH IT FINALLY CAME"" while the other was saying ""oh no.....""
I expected a lot from it since it was of course attack on titan, but a part of me also expected it to be a bust and not live up to the hype. 
But it took me by surprise
                  when the suspense, drama and action picked up where it left off in the first season. The plot twists kept coming and i kept eating it up like the filthy consumer I am. 
Though I was quite disappointed in its short life-span it kept me wanting more...though not as much as when i finished the first season.",8
"
                I was in love with season one. I thought it was well done and conceptually amazing. It had a good balance of everything really. The story was decently paced and the soundtrack was phenom.
I finally saw season 2 and here is the issue.
The constant timeline jumping is out of hand. multiple times we get stuck in 8 minute flashbacks and then the whole ""1 week earlier"" ""6 hours earlier"". Stories should be told how it happens.
This whole season it was forcing ""plot twists"" and a VERY slow paced story line. I actually was getting bored quite a few times. So much is left unexplained and
                  it is relying on a cliff hanger to bring viewers back, leaving off on a cliff hanger always can end up going the way of HalfLife 3. Some characters are brickwalls now, and others had their importance diminished. Other characters became confusing and nonsense.
Meanwhile the art is still great, and the soundtrack was AWESOME.
I think this has potential and alot of gems. It unveils some very important things.",6
"
                Spoilers will be discussed in this review.
Unlike my thoughts of AOT’s 1st season, I enjoyed my first viewing of S2 a lot. From memory, I remembered appreciating the focus on the side characters more than the main trio, as I felt the strengths of the show were better exemplified with them rather than a screaming lunatic. I also liked the more mysterious air the show had now and remembered the pace being slower than S1.
After rewatching, the strengths I still stand by (though I appreciate Eren’s value a lot more now) but I could not have been more wrong about the slower and more thoughtful
                  pace. I always found it funny when people discuss the season’s of this show, S1 is always the rollercoaster while S2 is the one with more plot progression.
S2 is just as much an insane ride as S1, if not even crazier at some points. The set pieces are incredible, and the relentless pacing of important, hype-filled events is astounding.
The slower moments were a little better in this season because of how much the mystery has grown. Every conversation was interesting to hear and the way this season builds up suspense is masterful.
The very first episode is very dialogue driven except for the end which is crazy. The Beast Titan is, in my opinion, the scariest titan revealed up to that point and the whole scene with the Scout Captain (can’t remember his name) was bone chilling. Seriously, he has one of the most disturbing deaths in the series so far.
After a great moment with Sasha in the next episode, we then head to the Castle battle which is my favorite sequence in this season. The hopeless feel and the brutal deaths filled these episodes with a sense of dread. You don’t know what’s gonna happen, especially since none of the main three are present.
Then, it culminates in an epic reveal and rescue scene. Truly a classic moment. But then…it gets crazier.
Spoilers in bound (for the two people that haven’t seen this show yet) but Reiner and Bertholt’s reveal was incredible. The build-up with Eren not wanting to believe it, and the casual way it’s revealed was pretty unique and unexpected for a show as bombastic as this.
But the transformation and subsequent battle steals the show. The epic new songs by Sawano are god tier and mixed with the raw emotion of feeling betrayed by two likable characters makes you, the viewer, feel just as hurt as Eren and the others. This show would not be as good without Sawano’s score, I truly believe that. It brings that something extra to every scene, and the transformation and battle scene is a great showcase of that.
Then, the rescue operation. So much more was revealed in this arc than I remembered. The way this show builds mystery is honestly award worthy. You see Marley soldiers before you even know who they are, you see the edge of the island where Marley turns people to titans well before Grisha’s past is revealed.
Ymir for me is the GOAT of this season. She went from a character that wasn’t even named in season 1 to one of the most important players in the story. Her backstory was unique and really made me feel for her. The scene where she looks up to the stars and the song “Call of Silence” peaks actually brought a tear to my eye.
Continuing on with the topic of mystery, there’s parts of Ymir’s past I still don’t know about, and that’s amazing. It’s satisfying and mysterious, and beyond the hype, that is the core of this show, and this arc perfectly exemplifies this.
But the moment that will stick out to me the most in this season, the one that has stuck with me the most is in the final episode. Death is an important part of this show and is arguably one of the best series to handle it.
Every death is meaningful and impactful to the story, but most have been characters with no real sentimental attachment. Hannes is different. I’m not sure what the general consensus on him is, but his death is probably the most tear-jerking in the series at this point, even counting both parts of Season 3.
He was there at the very beginning, he knows the main trio. Their struggles, hardships, and pain. He failed to save Eren’s mother and that has stayed with him. Despite this, he never lets his guilt get the better of him. Throughout Season 2, he helps Eren, Armin and Mikasa continuing moving forward and every scene with him brings a smile to my face. (Special mention to the hilarious flashback scene where everyone gets in a fight).
His burden is mighty, even mightier than Eren’s so to see the titan that devoured her return, Hannes fights to life and limb to avenge her. No scene in this show has hit me harder than his death. The final look he gives to Eren as he is ripped apart and eaten brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it.
Since the beginning of the show, it is the most hopeless moment for our characters. The complete silence surrounding the scene directly connects you to how Eren feels. This scene is incredible and really showcases how smart and well crafted this series is.
Overall, this is one of the best follow-ups to a hyped show ever made. The non-stop roller coaster continues and keeps on rolling until the very end. I loved this season just as much as the first, and I can’t wait to continue re-watching up until I catch up to Season 4.",10
"
                I am reviewing ANIME so I won't be comparing how well it represents manga and etc.
\\ spoiler alert just in case //
Art: 9/10
Stays pretty much same through the series with amazing scenery and fights.
Characters: 8/10
Beast titan is introduced, but overall it's the old crew from season 1.Character progression: 8/10
It is mainly developing Historia AKA Krista and her relationship to Ymir and side characters. 
Story: 7/10
ELITE TEAM STRIKES AGAIN. Seriously what is with kiling Levi's people like their are weaklings. 2nd STRONGEST member from Levi's only behind Levi's killed in 1st episode. I know anime shows he was suprised by Beast titan throwing horse at him, but I am not buying it, no way elite soldier wouldn't be able to react. Now to the synopsis, Titans appeared within wall Rose and our characters are searching for a gap, but it is found out there isn't any and titans within wall are transformed humans. This season follows mainly side characters of SnK following to showdown between Eren and Scout corps with MP's aid against colossal titan Bertholt and armored titan Reiner in the last episodes and later reveal of eren's power to command titans.
Story progression: 8/10
Some nice plot twists and overall it goes really well.
Since Bertholt and Reiner were revealed to be antagonists at the end I won't include Villain category.
Sound: 9/10
Every season of SnK have great openings, endings and battle music, this one isn't an exception.
So overall rating of Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2 is 8,17/10 that means 8/10. It is not a bad season and it was important to sequel, but I think this season was overall weakest.",8
"
                This was better than last season in quality, but its been so long i was ten when i watched the first season so I probably thought the first was way better than it actually was. but this review is about season 2 so here it is:
I HATED this at first... I dropped this anime 4 times before I finally sat down and committed myself to finishing it no matter what, turns out it was pretty damn good. Fulfilling the expectations, and really idolizations I had for the first season was impossible, especially after so long. It wasn't until after I forgot about them and watched
                  it like just another show could I appreciate it for what it really was. The world building of Attack on Titan is some of the best ever, the story has an amazing air of mystery around it and creates suspense that made me refuse to put it down once I finally got into it. In the first season we saw Erin's hatred of the titans and the irony that he is what he hates most. I loved that aspect, it was very unique story telling for our medium. While the slow pacing and ""out of the blue"" reveals shocked me at first and honestly I couldn't enjoy them for what they were because i couldn't understand them, I had to go back and remember everything to realize just how powerful and narratively amazing these reveals and events were.(who doesn't love some good narrative). Highly recommended for anyone who likes anime, and the buildup into the next seasons are amazing. Even if you hated this its worth watching for how great season 3 and 4 are and will be. 
I edited this review because when i first made it i was an ignoramus. Here is a little excerpt from the deleted review:
""season 3 is about to come out so maybe they make up for a mediocre season [2] by giving us another quick mediocre season 3... didn't live up to the hype""
I was wrong, go watch it.",8
"
                STORY: Season 2 has continue where they have left off. Since they are still battling the titans and save humanity... There is more mystery to be unraveled. Earlier in this season, some of the members found something that involves one of the walls. From there, it turns out that there is more stuff to be discovered beyond that. Luckily, we get to see some of the other characters and their backstories this season.
CHARACTERS: The members of the Survey Corps are back from the previous season!
OVERALL: 12 episodes can't do it justice! I assumed that it would be 25 episodes (again). It felt rushed and left
                  the plot very vague and unexplained. To be honest, it kind of reminded me of how The Blue Exorcist: Kyoto Saga did it. (Season 1 had 25-26 episodes, while the second season has 12 episodes). On the bright side, the battle scenes and the cliffhangers are still on point!",6
"
                re-posting my list-comment as review, originally written May 9th 2021:
this season is just so..short? when I originally finished the first season of the anime I caught up with the manga at the time and it felt like there wasn't super much happing (yet), so I was surprised to find out that that turned out to be the entire second season. Compared to the other seasons it's just VERY short. Watchable in half a day short. You're JUST getting into it and it's over. That being said, that's just the material they had to work with and they DID wait years to avoid running out of
                  source material. 
This season adds important new plotpoints that'll pay off greatly later, but I remember (the same went for the manga) it felt a bit strange and unexpected (in a odd way) at first. The plot is my least favourite out of all season, but it lays very important groundwork for the later development of the plot, and also gives some interesting character development - which is great, because while I love the characters in attack on titan, it doesn't particularly shine in character development compared to other shows. Certain chracters gain some interesting motives and struggles here that make them more interesting! 
The last ~3 episodes have the typical on-the-edge-of-your-seat grab known from the first season again, and add some VERY interesting elements to solve for the next season! I was inbetween giving this a 7 or a 8 (again, very short season and the plot is just not my favourite) but it gets the bonus towards the higher grade for the already mentioned 10/10 music in all of SnK and because it holds up very well against other animes I've watched - realistically it only falls off because i'm ranking it against other SNK seasons..",8
"
                The struggle against the giant naked man-eating giants return once more 
There will be spoilers present in character analysis from the previous season please be aware.  
Intro 
Ah yes Attack on Titan the hit military themed anime that stormed the world back in 2013. At the time Attack on Titan had a strong showing mainly because it had a lot of interesting themes that combined with an excellent cast of characters, slick animation and excellent voice acting quickly made it a favourite of mine.  This season continues from the last episode of the previous season and continues to show the struggles and battles
                  that Eren and the survey corps fight against the Titans bringing with it the same qualities that made the first season such a strong anime.  
Story and setting 
Attack on Titan takes place in a fantasy world where humanity as a race has been forced to abandon large parts of its territory due to the advance of a race of man eating humanoid giants called Titans that devastate all in their path. As a result of this humanity has been forced to seek refuge and subsequently live in towns that are located behind large walls that protect them from Titans. The story of Attack on Titan follows the adventures of Eren Yeager a young human who as a result of a trauma in the past decided to join the military and get revenge on the Titans. After awakening the power to become a Titan Eren quickly becomes a critical resource of the elite survey corps and fights with then to stop the Titans and the enemy infiltrators that’s in their own ranks. In terms of theme Attack on Titan has a very militaristic and nationalist theme to it that emphasizes heavily on loyalty not just to the human race as a whole but also to the cause of eradicating the Titans as well and stop them from destroying Humanity. 
Eren 
Eren played by veteran voice actor Yuki Kaji of Accel world and Joker game fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A young man and a veteran soldier by the time this season resumed Eren is a brave, tenacious and determined person who fights against the Titans with a fierce determination and courage that only members of the survey corps cam match. Because of the death of his mother and the beginning of the war as shown in the previous season Eren views all Titans as enemies of mankind and though this has lessened since discovering his own powers this trait can still manifest itself when confronted by enemy infiltrators like Annie. Eren believes very much in the cause of the survey corps and in their task and objective of liberating the territory that they have lost to the titans and as such has a lot of trust in members of the corps like Edwin and Levi that he also respects a great deal. Arguably Eren’s most defining trait is his loyalty to his friends and allies as Eren always cares about them first before worrying about himself. However, while Eren certainly has a lot of traits that make him both a good person and character he also does have a fair share of negative traits as well. While a capable soldier in his own right even without his titan powers Eren has a tendency to be brash in his actions which can make him somewhat predictable at times. He also has problems in reacting rationally at times often getting too hung up on strong emotions like anger and letting them dictate his actions. Though these traits are sometimes good things for a soldier here they highlight the fact that Eren is still very much a young man that still has much to learn about being a soldier. All in all, Eren Yeager I felt was a well-designed character that emphasized the determination and courage that normal people that live within the walls must find when confronted with the threat of the titans. Yuki Kaji I felt did an excellent job portraying the character of Eren. 
Mikasa 
Mikasa Ackerman voiced by veteran seiyuu Yui Ishikawa of Owari no seraph and Qualidea code fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Eren’s allies in this series. A young woman around Eren’s age Mikasa is both a childhood friend and the adapted sister of Eren because of her family’s murder. As a result, Mikasa and Eren have a rather unique relationship that does seem that it goes beyond normal family relationships. In terms of personality Mikasa is very like Eren in that she too is a brave and determined person that is also loyal to her friends. The defining trait of Mikasa is no doubt her excellent combat skills and ability. Though lacking any special titan powers that define Eren’s character Mikasa nonetheless compensates this by having impressive combat abilities that enable her to handle any titans that get in her way. Her combat ability is such that even when still in training she was assigned to the rear-guard elite units compared to her allies and friends that were assigned to the mid guard units. In terms of combat ability, it’s surprising to see that she is equal in skill to both Edwin and Levi despite both being veterans of the survey corps that have seen more action and have more kills under their belt that she has. The other defining trait of Mikasa is her dedication to Eren and her determination to protect him from anything that can be a threat to him.  As a result of their childhood and the events that led to her being adapted into his family Mikasa is very devoted to Eren and as such she will try to protect him at all times from anything that can hurt him. Even if such threats are their own allies Mikasa will not hesitate to take them down if they were there to hurt Eren in some way. This devotion to Eren however can however make Mikasa somewhat narrow minded in her actions as when Eren is in danger Mikasa often will try to take action herself and though she will be able to handle any threat that heads her way this will place her under undue risk and danger. I felt that Yui Ishikawa really did a pretty good job in voicing the character of Mikasa. 
Armin 
Armin voiced by veteran seiyuu Marina Inoue is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Eren’s allies in this series. A childhood friend of both Eren and Mikasa and an important ally to them Armin is a quiet but fast thinking and intelligent person that nonetheless is still a capable combatant to both them and to the survey corps. Personality wise Armin is a quiet person that loves to read and learn about new things. Paired with this studious nature is his strong observation skills that allows Armin to analyse a given situation and come up with solutions or theories that can help them. Usually with characters that are intelligent in animes they often have the tendency to be restricted in the knowledge that they can make use of as they will be restricted to thinking inside the box that is created from established doctrine. However, in this case this is not so as due to Armin’s free-thinking nature Armin is able to most often come up with solutions and theories that not even Hange the head researcher for the survey corps can come up with. Every military no matter how many well-trained soldiers that they have under their command will also need thinkers that are able to react to changing situations and new developments that are often changing on the battlefield and in this Armin fulfills that key role. 
While a thinker Armin never less is still a soldier and member of the survey corps and is still capable of taking down titans on his own though it’s always surprising when he does. In this season, it can be seen that as a character Armin has seen plenty of character development when compared to his past self in the previous season. In the previous season Armin was quite bit also timid and couldn’t deal with pressure that well. He also was reluctant to offer his own analysis and interpretation of events as well. However, as a result of his experiences in the first season Armin’s personality changed for the better and in this season, he become a vital character for not just for Eren but also for the survey corps as well. All in all, I felt that Marina Inoue did an excellent job portraying Armin. 
Levi
Levi voiced by veteran voice actor Hiroshi Kamiya of Gundam 00 and Bungou stray dogs fame is one of the main support characters of the show and is one of Eren’s main allies in the series. A veteran member of the survey corps with the rank of captain Levi is one of the most famous officers within the corps due to both his fame as one of the strongest man in the corps as well as the number of titan kills that he has under his belt. Personality wise Levi is rather unique in that he actually has two different personalities that differ from each other. Levi’s first personality is the personality that he adapts when he is conducting his normal duties. In this personality Levi is a quiet but brooding person that can come off as disrespectful as he offers his opinions freely which can also be negative and not becoming of an officer. This is the personality however that makes Levi such a dependable ally to Edwin and the senior commanders of the survey corps. Though this personality does make him somewhat unsociable and blunt to his fellow soldiers this serves to hide his true personality. 
Levi’s true personality which is the one that he hides from his fellow soldiers is the more honorable side of his personality. In this personality while still slow to trust others Levi as a person is more caring about the men that serve under him and he tries to take care of them to the best of his ability without being obvious about it. The prominent thing about that stems from this personality is the motivation that he gets from this in that for every friend and fellow soldier that he was unable to save or protect Levi will fight ever harder to save others and thus this serves as a sort of motivation for his determination. As a character though Levi can be somewhat cold to people that don’t know him he serves as a good contrast to the likes of Eren and Mikasa as he understands loss far more than they do as his long career in the survey corps have no doubt cause him to see many of his friends and fellow soldiers die in front of him. This means that he can act as a presence that can tamper characters like Eren who always tries to rush off rashly. I felt that Hiroshi Kamiya actually did a pretty good job voicing the character of Levi. 
Sasha 
Sasha voiced by veteran seiyuu Yuu Kobayashi of Bleach and High school fleet fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is a fellow member of the survey corps. A brave and friendly person that can also be surprisingly absent-minded Sasha like the majority of Eren’s allies is a graduate of the 104th training corps and as such is also Eren and Mikasa’s friend. Back in the first season Sasha mainly due to her personality trait of loving to eat was mainly used for comic effect though in this season as a result of her growth as a character this has been lessened. Like her fellow soldier and graduate Connie Sasha grew up outside the walls where she lived with her family and practiced a more traditional lifestyle that focused on hunting in lands that had belonged to their ancestors for generations. As a result, Sasha’s attitude and actions were rather strange to her fellow trainees when they were still trainees. However, despite that the skills that she knew not only enabled her to graduate from the training corps but also allow her to join the survey corps as well. 
Despite her penchant for eating Sasha is still a capable soldier that can still hold her own against a titan and can be surprisingly loyal to her friends and fellow soldiers. Back in the first season Sasha was a somewhat timid person that got scared easily and as a result made plenty of mistakes. However, as the first season progressed she gradually become more confident. In this season, we can see that while still fearful of titans Sasha is also brave enough to stand up to titans and fight them off with just a bow. She also cannot stand by and watch as innocents are being killed in front of her as well. Her stand to protect that young girl from a titan while armed with nothing but a bow was one of her best scenes in the anime. 
Connie 
Connie Springer voiced by veteran voice actor Hiro Shimono of Log Horizon fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Eren’s allies in the series. An optimistic person that is both loyal to the human race and to his friends Connie is someone that tries his best at everything while trying to stay positive. Though an optimistic person and one that cares a great deal about his allies and friends Connie’s major flaw is perhaps the fact that he is far too trusting. This has the unfortunate effect of making it hard for Connie to adapt to new situations as he often has difficulty in controlling his feelings. In the previous season, it can be seen that Connie had a rather joking personality that had the effect of alleviating tense moments. At this point it can also be seen that he also liked to flaunt his skills somewhat. Though the joking side of his personality still remains Connie’s flaunting of his skills are now gone and now more than ever he tries to be more professional and precise with his skills. 
Reiner and Bertolt 
Reiner and Bertolt played by veteran voice actors Yoshimasa Hosoya and Tomohisa Hashizume are one of the main characters of the series and are important plot central characters of the series. Originally both Reiner and Bertolt were members of the same training corps that Eren and the rest of his friends were from and as such were actually their allies from the beginning of the last season. Of the pair Reiner was actually the one that was featured more heavily within the series while Bertolt was only featured sparingly and only in a handful of scenes. Of the pair, however I would say that Reiner was probably the most interesting of the two. Personality wise Reiner was a brave, tenacious and determined person that was also loyal to his friends and to the cause of humanity. He was also charismatic and as such inspired loyalty among his fellow trainees and later soldiers causing him to be trusted by a lot of people most notably Connie. Bertolt who acted as Reiner’s partner though featured less than him had a much different personality in that he was quieter and reserved but proved to be surprisingly loyal to both Reiner and to the members of the training corps. 
The most prominent trait of both Reiner and Bertolt is of course the fact that they actually had two different personalities that they adapted during their time with the training corps and then the survey corps. Once again, I found that the struggle that Reiner had with his mask was the more interesting one. The two-different persona’s that Reiner adapts had a number of traits that interchange with other and thus making it easy for him to mistake his mask for his real identity which I felt was interesting. Watching Reiner struggle to revert his personality from the mask to his real self while also seeing him remember the qualities and actions that were from his other self I felt was interesting. Bertolt too had this problem as well but I felt that his struggle was more in line with how his mask struggles with his true personality as well. All in all, I felt that the characters of Reiner and Bertolt were interesting characters and that the twist behind them was well done and executed. 
Krista and Ymir
Krista and Ymir played by veteran seiyuu’s Shiori Mikami and Saki Fujita are one of the main support characters of the series and are Eren and co.’s allies. Both were members of the 104th training corps like Eren was and both on graduation elected to join the elite survey corps. Personality wise Krista though shy and timid on first glance is also relatively kind though at first, she doesn’t seem to know how to interact with people. As the series progresses however Krista after making friends with Eren and the members of the 104th training corps develops a sense of loyalty to both them and to the cause of the survey corps. Her most defining trait is no doubt her determination to succeed at her given task and also her determination not to leave anyone behind. Though quiet and timid back in the first season by the start of the second season Krista has gotten braver with her noticeably taking more risks. 
Ymir in the beginning of the first series was a fellow cadet of Krista’s that quickly become close friends. Personality wise Ymir is a quiet person by nature who seems to prefer solitude than hang around with friends and as such she and Krista can be said to make a pretty good combination. Because of her personality many people including Eren did not really hold a great deal of trust in her as to them Ymir was as much a mystery to them as the Titans were to Eren. This stems from the fact that Ymir’s personality can be defined as cryptic, mysterious and shady. As a result of her past however Ymir is a person that is slow to trust people and I fact the only person that she seems to trust is Krista herself. Arguably the most defining trait behind the two is the bond that they share between them. The bond itself is a testament to the friendship that Krista and Ymir have forged over their the time that they have known each other and also a testament to the trust that they have in each other as well. Overall, I felt that this bond though a plot element was actually pretty well done and felt natural rather than forced when similar things are done in other anime’s. I felt that the characters of Krista and Ymir were pretty well designed and that their respective seiyuu’s actually did an excellent job portraying them. 
Erwin 
Erwin Smith voiced by veteran voice actor Daisuke Ono of Muv Luv and Owari no seraph fame is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Eren’s allies in the series. The current commander of the survey corps and Eren and Levi’s immediate superior Erwin is a rather complex character that can be hard for people to understand. Personality wise Erwin is an inspirational, determined and far thinking person and extremely perceptive. As the commander of the survey corps and a veteran soldier as well Erwin is also both a capable strategist and a skilled soldier. Apart from being a capable strategist and capable soldier Erwin was also a very capable speaker and this season provided plenty of opportunities for him to deliver a number of excellent speeches that were both motivational and had the desired effect of inspiring his men to greater feats of valor.  This is reinforced by the fact that Erwin always tries to lead by example which means that often after giving his speech he would often be charging towards the enemy sword in hand and thus providing even more motivation for his men. 
There are a number of other personality traits that Erwin possesses that also make him a good commander. Firstly, and foremost among them is Erwin’s calculating nature which when combined with his skill at far seeing makes him a formidable planner. Secondly Erwin is extremely perceptive able to perceive the flow of a battle quite easily which itself is a necessary skill for any battlefield commander. These traits combined with the ones mentioned before make Erwin Smith a truly capable commander and one of the survey corps brightest stars which ensure that he is highly regarded by both the men that serve under him and the military’s upper command structure. One thing about Erwin that I noted however is that his tactics though almost always successful tend to be rather reckless in that the risks that his men are exposed to during execution of his strategy are unusually high. This means that while successful his strategies always result in high casualties. Still I guess this goes well in reiterating that the survey corps are buying time for a human victory by selling their lives dearly to the cause. Overall, I felt that the character of Erwin was a great character and that his voice actor Daisuke Ono really did a great job portraying him. 
Arts and animation 
Attack on Titan had always been famed for its excellent animation with focus on the many combat scenes that make it such a great fighting anime. In the case of season 2 this aspect continues to be seen and I thought that the animation for the series was excellent and was very clear. The combat scenes for the series I felt was very well done in not just the scenes where Eren fought against other titans but also in the battle scenes between the survey corps and the titans. Each of the combat scenes in this series was paired with some excellent background music that often had the effect of getting the viewer fired up with the best examples being the scouting legions assault on the titan forest. Scenes wise the season featured far more battles than the previous season and in this there were plenty of epic moments in the series with my personal favourite being the scouting legions charge straight into a titan melee.  
Music 
Scene music was particularly strong in the series particularly during the combat and action scenes as well as during the lead up to the battles with the lead up to the forest battle being especially impressive. Opening song was pretty strong and really gets your blood pumping because of both the visuals and the strong vocals. 
Voice acting 
Voice acting for the series is another strong point that this series always had and in this case, it is once again repeated. Particular praise here would go to Daisuke Ono whose character Erwin who in this season made a lot of great and inspirational speeches is one of my favourite characters. I thought that he did a fantastic job voicing the character of Erwin. Other seiyuu that deserve some praise are the seiyuu’s for Mikasa, Armin and Krista who are voiced by Yui Ishikawa, Marina Inoue and Shiori Mikami who I felt did a great job in voicing their respective characters. 
Overall conclusion 
Overall the second season of Attack on Titan was an excellent anime that had an excellent story, excellent characters, excellent animation. Voice acting and kick ass music. The second season brought back the familiar tension and excitement that the first season had and It kinda felt like I was welcoming back a long-lost friend lol. 
Attack on Titan always had a great story that was both interesting and action packed. While the first season of the anime focused on establishing the land and the characters as well as the threat of the titans this season was focused on dealing with a threat that was very much real and near them. this meant that the pace of the anime was slightly faster than the first season but not by much. The story for attack on titan was always famed for the fact that it can feature a surprisingly number of twists and revelations and in this season, this was delivered quite well. 
 In terms of characters however I felt that the series did start to stumble though this is mainly due to the source material which in this case is the manga and its inherent weaknesses. While the main characters for the series like Eren and Mikasa were well developed and was continuously being improved over the series the same can’t be said of other characters despite them being important parts of the support cast. Connie in particular while an important part of the support cast that appears in much of this season’s episodes doesn’t have much development in him which I felt he desperately needed. While it was nice that characters like Sasha and Erwin had more development, I felt that this could have been repeated for others. However, this is a problem for the source material and since the anime is adapted directly from it I guess it has to follow it exactly. 
One particularly strong thing that this season actually had was the music. The opening theme in particular I felt was pretty well done as the tone of that song was really strong and really helped in actually firing the viewer up for the episode because of it. The visuals for the opening also helped in this regard too. The ending theme itself was a contrast as its tone was very somber but given that each episode of the series often featured loss of life I guess it’s intended purpose reflected this.",8
"
                Attack on Titan Season 2 picks up immediately where Season 1 left off, with a bit of a jarring difference as you notice its been 4 years since the show picks up. The next thing you'll notice is this season is significantly shorter, being a little under half of the runtime of Season 1. But this season is huge for character development and foreshadowing. Character secrets come to light, and side characters with mere minutes of supporting time last Season become main characters and we really get to see what makes them tick.  The story starts somewhat slow, but is carried by an interesting
                  conflict that will have you  going to the next episode before the ED even ends. Its an easy and short watch. The only complaint I have is the story depends very heavily on flashbacks, so get ready to spend a good portion of the season within smaller flashbacks that lead almost directly into their importance. Other than that, this Season was a solid entry in Attack on Titan.",8
"
                Almost every complaint I had with the first season was improved in the second, and then some. 
The first season of Attack on Titan was shallow to me. The characters felt one-dimensional, the main characters were whiney in typical shounen fashion, the still frames were quite terrible, and the show felt like it was an action packed rollercoaster ride for the most part. But the creative team behind this series really stepped their game up with the twelve episodes that follow the first act. 
The art is much improved. Attack on Titan has gone from still frames and basic art to fluid motion and a
                  beautifully byzantine like style. There are thick outlines on character's faces, their eyes look like vast gateways into their souls, and the scenery is becoming much more beautiful compared to the depressing wall city and drab wilderness of the first. This season is really unique in it's artistic direction.
The story is much improved. I felt the first season dragged some things out wayy too long and a few lines were repeated by several characters (how many times did they make someone say, ""why am I thinking about this right now""). While some character dynamics are still shallow and confusing (the relationship between Ymir and Historia is kind of silly and mysteriously obsessive for an anime only viewer such as myself), I felt that overall there is much more depth in the second season. Case and point, we are beginning to understand the motivations behind the Titan attacks, and I feel the writers have done well to reveal bits and pieces at a great pace.
I like the direction this show is going a lot. I'm quite puzzled at the fact that the first season is rated higher than the second and many of the episodes here have lower ratings than its predecessor. Regardless, I personally enjoy the change in direction and much needed faster pace. It's okay to draw certain aspects out, such as the Titans' backstory, but the first season was ridiculous in repeating dialogue for several characters and taking three episodes to depict what should have been depicted in one or two on multiple occasions.

"
                About the Season 2... I actually have alot of comments on this one and they can either be good and bad so please don't get mad at me for saying some mean things but they are all my opinions on the anime so save your fanboy or fangirl things to yourself
STORY:
-The story in my opinion got a bit boring and i just wanted to skip over some things and not watch them because they were lasting like 3 episodes and I just couldnt't stand it anymore so other then  that it was pretty good and no complains on other.
9/10
ART:
-Art is one of the best
                  things about the anime its so beautiful and they are really experts on doing art so cool and fitting with the anime like its suppose to have that fitting gore and its suppose to as scary as possible to see the world Eren and others see it. It's one of the things I absolutely love about the anime. 
10/10
SOUND:
-With a amazing art comes the sound which fits with it so amazingly and those are 2 things I personally love above any anime since its so beautiful and stunning espacially that lighting that strikes it makes such a beautiful beat when you wear good headphones and call your name is one of the best ost ever
10/10
CHARACTER:
-Eren Yeager- In season 2 he thinks he can do much more then he actually can which pretty much makes him useless and where everyone has to clean up his shit and I'll say this one more time and never again I don't like Eren neither in season 1 or 2 no other opinion can change my mind
-Mikasa_Ackerman- I have 6 words on her opinion- She is to obsessed with Eren. Like anything she does if she doesn't see Eren around she will go all like berserk and ask ' where is Eren?' and that's very very annoying like bruh he is a grown man he can take care of his crap
-Armin Arlert- He is to underrated and should get more credit. In my opinion best out of the these 3. He thinks for himself and instead of rushing into fights he thinks first and makes a plan before rushing like Mikasa or Eren 
I know I always describe these 3 but since they are kinda 3 main and since I have nothing special to say about others I just describe these 3. 
8/10
ENJOYMENT:
-Other then that it was super boring in some parts it was mostly great and would absolutely say one of the best anime ever made
9/10
OVERALL:
-I definitely recommend it to people who watched season 1 so don't hesitate to watch it. Story is a bit eh but its good and it fits and that's important so go watch it
9/10",9
"
                Story:10/10 
Amazing story with shocking plot twists and character reveals, the story continues beautifully from what it left off in Season 1 and continued in a very smooth pace towards the introduction of more titan shifters and character progression. 
Art:8/10
WIT studio did a pretty amazing job overall, but it had room for improvement, but still stands as one of the best anime experiences I've ever had. Compared to S4's animation by MAPPA I personally prefer WIT's approach and art style for a more medieval color tone.
Music:10/10
The music included in this season especially Shinzowo Sasageyo & YOUSEEBIGGIRL/T:T is definitely some of the best, and AOT music
                  has always been at the top of my anime music playlists. From blood boiling excitement, betrayals, rage, to freedom.
Character:10/10
 The season ignites the main story quest. The amount of character buildup, backstories, foreshadowing, character details whether expression or physical movements is master tier.
Enjoyment:10/10
Needless to say, I enjoyed it
Overall:10/10
Not only does Shingeki No Kyojin presents a beautiful fantasy, but also unfortunately painted elements of a realistic world. The author builds a foundation around the dreams of Eren, Armin, Mikasa, and the rest of the survey corps looking for salvation, and a childhood dream of breaking free. After watching S3&S4, the amount of foreshadowing and details included in this season deems this series a masterpiece, 10/10.",10
"
                Season 2 of Shingeki no Kyojin continues where season 1 left off, introducing many new story elements and twists. While I don't think it is in any way bad or even average, I think it falls behind compared to season 1. It just felt a little bit less special, I think might have been the nonstop action. Season 2 contains a lot more action than season 1, with it having few breaks other than some flashbacks after the first few episodes. The action was still well done and cool looking, but I think the non-stop titan smashing kind of bogged it down. Most of my
                  opinions about Season 1 hold true for Season 2, with it having mostly the same strong points and weakness as its predecessor. It was still a good time and leaves me hungry for the third season of the adventure.",8
"
                All I can say is WOW. What an incredible season. So many elements came into this season that continued what Season One did so well and made it even better. To name a few, the mystery of the Beast Titan, the surprise at Utgard Castle, and the Warriors. I have never felt so much emotion!! Betrayal, excitement, sadness, and more. This season was a roller coaster, a good one of course. The backstory of Ymir and Christa was nice to see as well. This season carried out the characters we know and loved and made them even more spectacular. Attack on Titan Season 2 (in
                  my opinion) is slightly better than the first and hits that 9.5-10/10 range.",10
"
                As I really enjoyed the first season of AoT, I was really looking forward to season 2.
All the characters involved were kind of interesting. Except of Eren. 
This continues. As a person Eren is one of the most useless guys ever be on screen. He has Titan superpowers. That`s his only reason that he must live.
INstead of forcing the main story, get more background of the TItans, the city, the conspiracy, history of all,  etc.
No! We are forced to watch the story of Ymir and Christa. Damn it! That`s one bunch of crap!
Yes, No, I can`t, is this the truth, I lied to me,
                  to everybody bla bla....
Reiner and Berthold have potential, but at least one of them should have died, and some more story to them would have been helpful.
The whole season felt like a huge filler episode. The main red-line is still interesting and hopefully well crafted next season.
In fact it`s very clever. Season 2 was so bad that season 3 can only be amazing. The open story lines can only get good with teh 3rd one.",3
"
                I’m sad. I thought that this season opened well with the first episode. The different titan that shows up in the beginning is mysterious and interesting. But I got more and more bored (and disappointed) as it went on. At the end we still don’t know any more about him. Let’s hope this changes in the next season. 
I feel like a lot of stupid things happen in this season. The first one is that when they have to explore the wall they “don’t have time” to put on their gear. They are potentially going on a mission involving lots of dangerous Titans without their
                  regular equipment? This is basically suicide and is soely done to increase the drama later on.
The second thing is that the people responsible for destroying the wall in the first place simply confess. It’s shown that one of them has gone somewhat insane but it’s no excuse. The reveal, of the culprits of the infamous first episode in the first season, is lame. A big disappointment. And we still don’t know exactly why they did it.
The third thing is what happens to Erwin in the second to last episode. This comes out of nowhere, serves no purpose and is, you guessed it, stupid. Why? To make him seem courageous? To make him seem heroic? He looked dumb. It is a wonder it hasn’t happened earlier if he was this incompetent. 
This season also suffers from slow pacing. Not that many things happen. As opposed to the first season (where the slow pacing was due to mood), the fault lies in backstories. There are backstories for a few different characters. And they are explained just in time before the information conveyed in them becomes relevant. An example is in the middle where Eren is fighting one of the Titans and suddenly remembers a move he learned while in training. We have never seen this before and it feels like a deus ex machina. Although it doesn’t help him in the end, its backstory is shoehorned in just before it becomes relevant. 
This last point is a nitpick, but why switch up the recap and intro order? The first season did this well. It always had recap in the beginning, then intro and then the new episode began. Perfect. How is this season doing it? It is different every episode. Sometimes there is new material in the beginning, followed by an intro and then recap. Sometimes new and old is mixed up before the intro. Why force me to struggle through the beginning every episode?
So I mostly dislike this season more than the first. But the animation and sound (especially the opening) are still great. I’m also still anticipating how everything is going to be explained and tied together later. That’s something that both this and the previous season lacks. Motivations and explanations.",4
"
                Aaaaaaand the milking has begun. The 2nd season of Attack on Titan is more of the same. Big ass titans, gory and naturalistic deaths.
If you were hoping to find out at least some of the secrets of what's going on with the politics behind all of this and the titans, tough luck. The story barely progressed at all. There were episodes towards the end where they could've crammed 3 episodes into a single, much more content rich one. Instead, they are dragging on and on with meaningless flashbacks and dumb, mind blowingly oibvious and dragged out discussions, which literally don't tell you anything about what's
                  going on. Hell, this whole season could easily be crammed into a 90 minute movie.
Yop, I think I'm done watching AoT. Your time is precious. Don't waste it on any more of this over-hyped garbage. Read the mango if you must.",5
"
                Attack on Titan S2 was a disappointment.
First, after years of waiting, we get only 12 episodes.
Secondly, the 12 episodes are told in a wildly achronological order, making it difficult to tell what's actually happening, what's a flashback, etc.
Third, significant portions of the twelve episodes are devoted to needless noodling over the romantic interests of secondary (even tertiary!) characters, with extended flashbacks/exposition, detailing in often painfully exquisite minutia their melodrama.
Fourth, main characters like Eren, Armin, and Mikasa, Levi and Erwin, get a much reduced amount of screen time due to #3. In fairness, Section Commander Hanji, one of the more interesting and endearing characters in the
                  series, gets more screen time in one episode than she did in the entirety of S1. 
On the plus side, the artwork is gorgeous, and the sound score impressively orchestral. The dub, however, is mediocre; too many voices are annoyingly high-pitched squeaks and squeals, like Alvin & The Chipmunks on helium, screaming at the top of their lungs. Or they're practically whispering/muttering, making it next to impossible to hear and understand them.
Go with the original Japanese with subtitles; it's not much better in this regard, but take what you can get.
Overall, there's a good story in here somewhere; and it sure is pretty to watch and listen to from a musical score standpoint.
However, the execution, or ""telling,"" of this story is a disjointed mess, with so many side-story/B-arc & C-arc character distractions, so many rewinds and flashbacks in order to deliver exposition on what's happening ""right now,"" that by the time the ""mess"" finally gets back to the main story, you may no longer give a damn.",6
"
                One of the greatest anime you'll ever watch is AoT S2. I promise that you will never regret watching this anime, at least to this season. I just finished S3, and S2 is still my favorite.
Characters: All A+. All are unique and amazing in their own ways.
Plot: A+ The more you know, the more you want to know. The author really knows how to take in his audience and never let them go. Amazing.
Artwork: There's a specific episode...I won't ruin it, but IMO it's one of the best animation I've ever seen. Just aesthetically pleasing.
I'm not sure what I like best about this anime. Maybe
                  it's the plot twists one after another. Maybe it's the amazing characters and world building that isn't so typical. I love it though. I wish I could forget and rewatch it all over again.",10
"
                Story
The pacing in season 2 is similar to the pacing in the pacing in season 1's second half. The story goes by too slowly. It would be fine if there was more necessary exposition, but most of it is stuff is neither interesting or relevant. However things do pick up towards the end of the season. Another common problem is the use of abrupt flashbacks. They do sometimes flesh out the backstory, but other times it is not extremely obvious so the story becomes more jarring jumping back and forth. The lore is more fleshed out, but still not a strong point of the show
Art
Artwork
                  and animation looks wonderful especially the battles
Sound
I think the first season had a better opening, but this one is good as well.
Character
Not a strong point of this this season. They are more fleshed out, but they are not super interesting. A lot of forgettable characters too. Not a very stong main cast this season.
Enjoyment
My main complaint is the pacing. Things take too long to happen. Characters are decent but not super memorable or interesting. A decent series, not too much different from the first season.
Overall
A decent season. I think it would be better if it was faster paced",7
"
                I watched Attack on Titan when it first aired and only started season 2 in 2021, I did watch the AoT 1 movie to get refresehed on the plot and from finnishing this season it's a really good sequel anime. A lot series get sequel season that don't follow up in quality of it's predecessor but Wit really improved the art style from the first season. It trades off the gritty line hatches in some areas for better quality sequences and still pays tribute to the source material beautifully when comprated side by side. This ain't an electric boogaloo season, this is more like a
                  GodFather level of sequel( means it's really good by the way).",8
"
                Awhile ago and after watching a considerable amount of relatively diverse anime, I finally started to enjoy things for what they are without detracting value due to identifying what a series didn't do because it wasn't trying to. Regardless of what anyone might want from the second season of Attack on Titan, in my personal assessment it provides the experience it tries to with a sinister elegance that captivated me thoroughly. 
The sound is dynamic. The Japanese voice actors are flatout incredible. The animation is varyingly awesome. The flow of the plot constantly rekindled my intrigue. The characters develop pleasantly. The artwork and especially the
                  line-work was impressively able to add texture to the immersion. 
I was engrossed in season one, and heard 2 can be boring in comparison. I'm gonna go ahead and respectfully disagree entirely there. Season 2 of Attack on Titan is bombastically entertaining in multifariously near-masterful ways. It's resonantly compelling, and I find myself exceedingly pumped to enjoy season 3~",9
"
                Another note for my future self
Second season seemed more settled down and inline with itself compared to season 1. 
OBVIOUSLY, the production and post-production departments did an amazing job. Absolutely love the animation. The use of 3D or reuse of shots is very understandable and well done. The strength and the backbone of this anime are the animators and the draftsmen. 
This time I don’t feel like ranting that much about the anime
Unfortunately, one thing is for sure - this anime is forgettable. 
Logically, the memories are based on emotions. The stronger the emotion, the more memorable the moment is. 
In filmmaking, to create a
                  memory, a connection, relation, to touch one’s heart/ soul/ believes/ the essence of one’s existing you use characters. Fictional people that feel real more than anyone else in real life, they become the embodiment of our dreams and values. 
This anime has none of that. None.
Without characters, plot is just like reading a chapter in a history book about certain period. 
It is fun to watch, for plot - very captivating, for animation - THRILLING, but all this hard work comes to waste, as you don’t remember anything of it. 
This anime like a beautiful, magnificent vessel, that is hollow and empty inside.
The writers binned it. no soul, no love, no passion from their side.",7
"
                I won't repeat myself from Season 1 review, so if you didn't see it, then go check it out.
In my opinion story in Season 2 is better than in Season 1, why? Because this is the point when history gets more and more complicated. The mysteries you heard in Season 1, are nothing in front of these, now it's your time to predict in what world do characters live. But I gotta tell you... if you expect this Season to make this anime have the best story... ho ho ho, you'll have to watch more. :>
Season 2 is mainly focused on characters, who weren't important
                  in previous Season. Also I think all characters were presented in the best way they could be.
Let's be honest, if you watched whole Season 1, then it was surely because you enjoyed it! If you enjoyed it, then you will probably enjoy 3rd opening and new adventures.
After watching Season 2 and seeing ending of the last episode, you're surely more excited than seeing an ending of Season 1.",10
"
                This season there's a significant turn in the story which I found to be too large and done too quick. It sort of threw a bunch of questions out there and didn't resolve enough of them to my satisfaction. The fustercluck of it all distracted me from really enjoying it, which was disappointing. Additionally, characters who previously weren't well enough established are given significant roles and their motivations are poorly reasoned. The particular ""reveal"" of such two character motivations and the subsequent events actually aggravated me a bit with how little sense and buildup there was. But, the animation is still very good, and the
                  soundtrack is still epic and glorious.",7
"
                I know I gave the sound, character, and enjoyment a 10 but it's really true, this season was astonishing and a great stepping stone for the 3rd season, the characters and their emotions felt so...real, it was a massive upgrade from the 1st season, with the story deepening, answering questions from last season while raising even more questions, keeping the viewer interested in the show. The OST for this season was also amazing, with Youseebiggirltt and much more it made the show more immersive, especially **Spoilers** When Berthold and Reiner betrayed the others. I would've given the show a 10/10 but, something is missing, and
                  I just don't know what..",9
"
                Unlike most people, I felt like this season was just better than the previous season in nearly all ways.  They still kept the thrilling action, but had more character development for the side characters and the main characters.  Even with getting spoiled, the moments still managed to shock me in the season.   The amount of emotional moments also were more striking, and the ending to the season was near perfect.  
Story 9/10:  The plot got expanded in nearly all ways.  There are more mysteries such as ""Where did Ymir go?"" and ""How TF did Eren do that at
                  the end?"".  This is where you get the first glimpses that AOT might not just be a basic plot line and there could be a lot more to this world than just Humans VS Titans.  
Art 9.3/10: Amazing thrilling action, but Colossal titan CGI makes it just not perfect.   
Sound 9/10: Great opening, Great soundtracks, not much else to be said. 
Character 8/10: Bumped up a lot from last season. The characters were more developed in nearly every way, especially Ymir and Historia, and who the colossal titan and armored titan still felt so shocking, despite me getting spoiled.  I did not understand the motivations behind many of the villains, and watching it second time through it just made so much more sense and made me love this season even more.

*rewatch*
As AoT begins to progress further into its world building and moral dilemmas (One of its strongest aspects), production and narrative takes a step backwards.
The scope widens past our main trio and captains to flesh out some of the more underappreciated Scouts like Reiner, Bertholdt, Sasha, Connie, and more, as the secrets of what lies behind the wall grows deeper and deeper as Titans and the Beast Titan invade Wall Rose.
I think one of AoT's biggest weaknesses is its lack of personality designated to
                  most of the Scouts besides the main leads. Learning more about Sasha's backstory and Connie's humanity adds depth but in the end did more for building the tense mood of the season than anything. More than anything though, I've never been very fond of Historia and Ymir's dynamic, and that unfortunately stays true. I can appreciate how their internal conflicts and struggle to find meaning within others and themselves is required to give the theming of humanity that lies within everyone behind the walls legs to stand on its own (and an aspect of the show that's so crucial in the Final Season), but it's always felt so uninvolved and I never found reason to care about what happens to either of them.
At the same time, this exploration into humanity also shows its benefits. Reiner and Bertholdt's dynamic shines so bright and the mental struggles Reiner especially shows through his personality disorder begins to build the bridge connecting the two different sides of humanity.
Perhaps this season's biggest grievance though is its need to constantly shove flashbacks and explanations down the viewer's throats. It's handled well enough in certain situations like the Colossal/Armored reveal, but absolutely kills other moments, like when Reiner breaks down in the forest and Ymir explains in full detail why he is in fact acting this way. I know this is an ""anime/shounen"" issue but it feels like padding and takes from the believablility the show is trying to establish.
On the more nitpickey side but the pacing is also odd at times. It goes from incredibly quick and fluid action sequences to entire episodes where almost nothing happens. A lot of these things were issues in the first season but not nearly as obvious.
This is all woven together by a disappointingly significant increase in production quality. When given the reigns, Araki shines once again (Like with Eren awakening the Founding Titan power) but it's so clear cuts were made. Horrible Colossal/horse CGI, butchered ODM scenes, dozens of close ups. It's something that's easier to get use to over time but feels like insane whiplash coming right off of Season 1's stellar and consistent animation.
I don't want my many issues to take away from the many things this season does right. I love seeing the mental buildup Eren is experiencing in retrospect after nearing the end of the show. There's this subtleness hiding behind the ""suicidal maniac"" still there and it's glorious. S2 is also the peak of the horror elements that have all but vanished in S4. The more detailed/less cartoony style lends itself to some truly disturbing moments. The introduction of the Beast Titan, Connie's mom, the girl Sasha saves who's watching her mother being eaten alive, I actually found myself speechless at times. The more abundant close ups too lend itself to incredible facial expressions and eye detail that's unsettling but carries so much emotional weight to it. It made the production compromises really worth it.
I know that people believe AoT suffers from ""forgetting cast members"" syndrome as the narrative shifts focus on specific characters in certain arcs but I really like how Armin, Mikasa, Erwin, etc have their own special moments even if they aren't in the spotlight.
This season is really odd overall on a rewatch because of how much hinges on the reader being clueless to the mysteries of the world. I don't think it invalidates my current feelings but is something to definitely note.
To conclude, I can't not mention the masterpiece that is ""Warrior"". Now with AoT almost reaching it's end, the initial reveal is still one of the most captivating episodes and gives Reiner the wings to soar later on. Ymir's backstory is another standout.
Overall, Attack on Titan Season 2 was disappointing going back towards, but doesn't take away from the fact it's still what I love about AoT at its core, and I have full confidence in my enjoyment of what's yet to come.",7
"
                AOT Seasons 2 builds upon it's predecessor and takes a major step forward to being something greater and more special than it already is.  AOT seasons 2 is twice as short as season 1 but manages to make up for it with brilliant character exposition and an undeniable hype that can be compared to very few other animes. 
The story had a pretty good start and a more dramatic and better finish but was too short/rushed and had some minor flaws . Tbh considering the pacing inconsistencies of season 1 , season 2 could have easily squeezed into season 1.The buildup and atmosphere of
                  the last season is directly carried into this since it place takes right after Annie's capture which is both a good thing and a bad thing. The flow was badly affected and lacked in freshness since it is connected to season 1's plot but had action and intensity that is at the same level as season 1 if not higher. Within the first few eps even after some major shockers we are just clueless as Eren on what the bigger plot is and what is really going on revolving around the Titans. Strange connections, seamless coincidences, and much more. We get small hints and clues but never able to figure out the bigger picture. It definitely was a bit more dark and gruesome compared to its predecessor.
Seasons 2 takes some screentime from our main characters such as Mikasa, Eren, Armin and focues on the supporting characters who are already detailed and deep impressively. Mainly Ymir, Bertholdt, and Reiner. Alot of people were confused with Ymir's decisions but to sum it up she was in no man's land. She is conflicted and doesnt know what the best choice was but Historia was the deciding factor. Reiner, he has developed split personas, one for being a ""warrior"" and one for being a ""soldier. We get to learn Bertholdt has a surprisng soft spot for someone and Eren is now going down a hellhole faster than I expected. Also a quick mention for Captain Erwin who has been an absoloute beast even though he had a short screentime. He already has enough burden on his shoulders I dunno how long he can take it anymore.
The visuals have been improved by quiet alot. I mean it's nearly been 4 years since the last season so it was sort of expected but it is still impressive. Everything seems much more detailed and sharp than before.
The hand drawn animation was pretty good but if look closely when they are running or sitting down they lag a bit probably using a different fps. The only time it really looks smooth is during action scenes. The directing was pretty good with flawless camera work. The music was quiet similiar to the last season. With identical uses of the vocals and instruments and new opening themes and ending
themes but has become much more varied and energizing than before. 
They manage to make it quiet an impressive season even though it's half as long. In my opinion it's better than season 1. Not saying season 1 is bad, it's great actually but seasons 2 is greater. Most people probably had confusion with the charcters such as Ymir and Reiner. Season 1 was balanced and focused on both the human and titan aspects while season 2 mainly focused on the titan action. But if you know the answers to the""truths"" then this season is probably much easier to watch. All the questions and mysteries was definitely answered fully in season 3.",9
"
                Attack on Titan Season 2 was one of the most anticipated shows of the year, let alone this season. Four years of waiting after a cliffhanger season finale fuelled with emotional intensity and more questions than anyone could have imagined, I had expected so much more from this season. I already know that going into this review, my opinion may be an unpopular one. But you know what, that’s totally okay.
The first episode of the new season picked up pretty much exactly where the first one ended. That was nice. The recaps were kept relatively short to compensate for the time elapsed in between seasons
                  without letting us drown in repetitiveness. There were a lot of minor things that I noticed about the show after a few weeks of watching. Some of them are good, but the rest are decidedly not great at all.
Let’s start with the technical stuff. The animation quality was good. Compared to the first season, that’s all it was: good. Initially, I felt the animation was far superior to the first season. But after a recent re-watch of the all 26-episodes, I’m inclined to disagree with that notion. The improvements overall were very miniscule in nature, which was one of the biggest disappointments that I felt. Wit Studio has produced some other shows within the four year span, all of which had spectacular animation. One such example is Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress (Kōtetsujō no Kabaneri), which was essentially a steampunk version of Attack on Titan. Nonetheless, it was gorgeous to watch with action scenes dripping in details and meticulous incorporation of CGI elements. Was it perfect? No. Was it a vast improvement over what they originally started with? Hell yeah. But alas, it wasn’t implemented with this new season of Attack on Titan. Part of me thinks that they didn’t want to deal with devastating time crunches that the company experienced when Season One was airing, where the rush and pressure produced shoddy work. I can respect that, but I still hoped for something a little bit more.
The action sequences themselves felt naked without the implementation of CGI similar to the styles used in the original season. There is a drastic change in artistic style in regards to movement and motion, that felt like a genuine step back. The lack of sharpness and the clarity that comes with computer enhancements, made the retrogression simulate hand-drawn sequences. Normally, that’s not a bad thing, but when you’ve already got your audience familiarised with better quality, it would be ill-advised to defer to something less than expected.
Some other things that I didn’t care for consisted of the overall plot, it’s progression, and implementation. The entire premise of the 12-episode season is basically a human treasure hunt, a damn slow one to boot. Detailed revelations on the existence of the titans was severely limited. We learn one or two things that lead to a much bigger picture, yet in the end it takes five hours to get there, and it’s really not that extraordinary in the grand scheme of things. The vast chunk of the season is devoted to long stretches of dialogue that could have been accomplished in half the time that they actually took up. If there weren’t dialogues, then there were an immense number of flashbacks, most of them we could’ve done completely without as they were snippets from the first season. There just wasn’t nearly as much storytelling as there should’ve been. There’s a whole lot of build-up to something super badass, only to fall utterly short with total dissatisfaction.
In any case, Attack on Titan does maintain it’s high-intensity suspense that just propels you forward one scene after another with disgustingly hungry eyes. You get so invested in what the hell’s going to happen next that the time flies by, making each twenty-some-odd minute episode feel like mere seconds in length. It’s always been damn good at enrapturing your entire attention. I adored that, missed it immensely even. It’s a trait that works very well for a series that has built itself up on viciously violent imagery and heartbreaking losses. Nonetheless, this may be its only redeeming quality.
Overall, I was not impressed with Attack on Titan Season Two. Having to wait four years for only 12-episodes of dialogue and flashback regurgitation seems like a colossal waste. I would have preferred waiting longer for a much better and beautiful storytelling experience. While I am happy that I got to watch this while it simulcasted, I’m very sad that I felt so frustrated with it.

"
                It was a very good experience after completing s1 . It was bit slow in first season but I really liked the story in this one and how it progressed. I was only watching it because my friends recommended me this show since long time, but now am hooked up with the story.
Art is good and clean.
Story telling is good.
Sound, music is good. As a JoJotard I really liked Jotaro's VA in this one playing as vital role.
In terms of fights it was looking great. The betrayals or should I say the sudden shock of someone being something was unpredictable which increased my curiosity of
                  what is about to happen.",9
"
                - spoilers! sorry -
i marathoned this all in one night so my head is totally buzzing right now. but i don't know how to explain how i feel about this season. it feels like a bridge between season one and three without resolving anything in a satisfying way to me.
don't get me wrong, it was fun, really fun to watch!! the fast-paced dynamic action scenes were GREAT and where the show really shines for me (yes i am an action junkie), and the world-building is also so interesting and extensive. there were lots of ideas that were introduced and i can't wait to see where
                  they take them! not to mention some great uses of music and a lot of tension interspersed with quieter moments that acted well to throw you off.
my issues are more to do with the plot - i think because this season is so short compared to season one, there was less time to develop things at a steadier pace. there were either lots of cliffhangers or then too much time was spent with characters that i really didn't care too much about (krista, ymir and bertoldt i'm looking at you. at least we knew a bit more about reiner but i still don't care about him a lot either). or then the characters died. rip.
and not all the ideas that were introduced were addressed, a lot has been left for season three - hence the feeling that this is like a middle point rather than a complete season in itself. we still know nothing about the beast titan, how people were turned into titans, what the titans want with eren (i can't help but feel that i missed something about this? maybe they mentioned it and i didn't realise because i spent a lot of time confused as to why they kidnapped him). and there is also the matter of eren's growing powers and the fact that just about anyone could be a titan, plus the titans in the walls as well
i have to mention the oh-so-big reveal halfway through as well - the way it was approached was kind of underwhelming to me, it was such a throwaway thing, i genuinely thought my subtitles were broken haha. but what an odd way of approaching such a huge reveal??? i was hoping for something a lot more dramatic and tense, instead it was just ""oh hey it's us! lol jk it's not! no actually it really is""
also can mikasa PLEASE get more lines that don't include the word ""eren"", i genuinely like her but this is getting a bit annoying now
finally, and most importantly, the audience has spoken and they want more levi thank you <3

                If you loved season one, you for sure have to watch this season. It’s not going to be perfect, but it’s still great! 
(spoiler free)
 Story - 9
While it is a downgrade from the initial hype of season one, this season’s story definitely isn’t bad. There are lots of great plot twists and suspenseful moments. However, the pacing is what took the score down for me. It felt like Ymir, Krista, Connie, etc. were in that tower surrounded by titans forever. Nevertheless, it was great writing. 
 Art - 10
You already know the art is great.  Sound - 10
Sound is great, pretty much just like the first season. The opening is AMAZING! One of the best openings ever! English dub of it isn’t even that bad!
 
Characters - 8
Don’t get me wrong, I really like all of the attack on titan characters. But I do like some more than others. Specifically Eren. Unfortunately, in this season we get less Eren content compared to season one. There is more on Ymir and Krista, who I honestly don’t care about that much... I wish they had been shown more in season one so that I could have developed more of a liking for them. But when two characters I barely thought about in season one start to have big parts in the story, it’s hard to really get attached to them. 
 
Enjoyment - 9
If there had been more Eren content and the pacing sped up a bit, I definitely could have given this a 10. Enjoyment would be an 8 if it weren’t for the excellent plot twists. That’s really what makes this season stand out. 
 
Overall - 9
You aren’t gonna want to miss this season! While I don’t consider it a masterpiece like the first season, it’s certainly not far from being one. 
 TLDR: Season two almost reaches the greatness of season one, but not quite. It’s still worth watching, just expect that it might be a little slower than you are used to, and focus will be added to characters other than the main trio.",9
"
                I entered this ride expecting more things to be explained , but uhhhhhhhhhhhhh.This show was like a school show and tell but the students only accomplished 50% of their acquired task.Unfortunately in a nutshell the glaring problems of season 1 was piled more on by season 2 creating this sink hole causing the whole show to kind of collapse in itself...at least for now.
To sum up the plot of AOTS2 there is more things happening .more people dying,more crazy revelations, and fake names? If you expect for all of these things to be explained  PREPARE TO BE DISAPPOINTED. No joke, this show has Occultic;Nine
                  levels of show don't tell.Sadly this is as far as I go for those who haven't seen the season, for those people, you should watch this season because there are things that happen but if this show does actually plan to end, the creators really have a LOT to live up to.  
SPOILERS{{{Leaving off on the things unexplained in my first season review: This freaking huge beast Titan comes out of nowhere and wrecks stuff. More people turn out to be titans but we don't know whhhy??? And even going back to Season 1 , we don't know why there are titans in the wall.  Here is an example of revelation without meaning.  We get the history of Ymir and we still don't know how she got turned into a titan . She got betrayed, stabbed in the neck and thrown off a wall. So how does that translate into being a Titan?!Oh there's more.. The whole king thing, the opening and ending visuals, the ""hometown"" that  Reiner talks about, the new power that Eren gets and that crazy ass revelation at the end of the last episode. Not to mention Connie's suspicion of the Titan at his town looking like his mother in the earlier episodes and for some reason revealing it at the final episode is like a major plot twist or something...... BS   Also 2018 SEASON 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. }}}}}
If there is one reason I feel like no one is talking about AOT season 2 is because when they realized they weren't getting season 2, they cut their losses and read the OG source material .It just angers me how long they waited to just drag out the season itself.There is that reason that""oh dey had 2 git ahed uf de manga"" but if that was the case, they could've FMA'ed it and adapted it again in the future. It worked out well in the past.  Of course the first episode had a rather mmm surprising ending but afterwardsIt just feels like each episode is just taking it's sweet time to explain what and why everything was happening and even teases us to an unbearable degree .
Getting on the less important stuff.
ANIMATION
Just when you thought the animation couldn’t get any better, it happened.The animation for season 2 is insanely great,like great to the 5th power.The fight scenes are the highlight of the show and in my opinion were even better looking than the first season.Looking at the opening alone makes you say”Yep, they really have been working on this for four years”.But it is not perfect.Especially with one thing so jarring and beyond sore thumb levels of sticking out….and that’s the CGI. Mainly for the colossal Titan in general.Compared to all the great 2D glory there is just this weird segment of 3D that looks like it’s a video game.I want to say that the 3D doesn’t last long enough to be glaring to many but it is way too obvious to just forget.I can forgive WIT for it though because many studios take the CGI misstep.
Bones used CGI for both FMA and Brotherhood than don’t come close to the actual animation,
And even Production I.G. for that dragon in Shingeki no Bahamut:Genesis..oh boy.
And the Titans are getting more and more scarier,so that’s fine and dandy.\
 SOUND
Hiroyuki Sawano is still at it again with his awesome and epic tracks.There is still music used in the first season and there are new pieces.Both of which are awesome.The opening for season is my favorite of the three openings.It combines the catchiness of the first opening and the epic chorus singing along from the second opening and combining it to make the freaking amazing piece.After the first episode, not a day has passed by where I don’t hum or sing “sasageyoSASAGEYO” for a long time.The ending theme to season 2 takes such a turn though.It is uncomfortable.The young chorus singing with the discording strings and keys makes me feel so depressed,combine that with archaic paintings of disturbing things like children eating a corpse and people being eaten by Titans with creepy colors(and also the shock of episode 1’s ending)
And you got yourself probably one of the most unsettling ending songs that I have heard so far in anime history (Besides the ending to the first season of Yamishibai).It’s just that the first two endings of the first season was a bit somber but still hopeful and determined. This one is just…...mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmh. To put that into words, I like it when I watch the show, but overall, the song is something I don’t want to listen to on it’s own.
CHARACTERS
All of the characters have returned that we all know in love meaning we can see what they are up to mostly right?...not really.Eren is sitting in a wagon somewhere in about half the episodes and the spotlight is given to the characters who coincidentally I know the least about. Ymir and Krista. While we know the most about Ymir at the end of the series, there is a great amount of focus on Krista. btw her real name is ""Historia"". That is not really a spoiler because it doesn't change anything.Also Reiner and Bertholdt got some 'splainin to do.But they don't. Eren is then a part of the plot midway.I prefer this Eren over Season 1 Eren because he tries to actually contain his emotions to figure out what the heck is going on.He fails, but at least he tries. Mikasa is still my favorite character. She goes crazy and it's the GOOD type of crazy that I love about her. Also the character plot armor is still as strong as ever out of all the expendable characters there are about two characters that I know from S1 that got killed. Not to say it wasn't effective, but it was just fat trimming.
ENJOYMENT
Did I enjoy this season, not . but I was dedicated to it because I was praying that something would be explained. I wouldn't have been disappointed if this season did not take so long to arrive. Each episode was going on so slowly to no avail and decided to have the audacity to stuff in some flashback to draw out time. Come On, good series or not that is BS in my opinion. This is one of those seasons in TV that is not better than the first season but it is required to watch  if you want to see the story progress. It's a slog to get through, but hopefully season 3 will make it worth it.
Overall-6

(LARGE SPOILER AT END OF STORY REVIEW)
Story-5
Now this 5 for story I can hear some of you quizzically wondering why I could ever put forth such lunacy, and the answer is its bland! There are so many holes and open questions left throughout the show that just make no sense. The entirety of season one was about getting to erens' house, where was that urgency? Where was the
                  quest for answers? And what was up with the pointless flashbacks? Someone is gonna say ""It makes for a deeper more clarified back story!!!!"" I have news for you, not when done like this, it may as well have been naruto giving us information we already knew just minutes ago. We already know eren is a bitch who is picked on, we already know armin cries and screams for mikasas' help, we already know mikasa has a crush on eren! So what was the point? msg me cuz idk. Let me also touch on the length of this. 12 episodes? After 4 years? I just have to say that for what we got was unacceptable! If you took out the flash backs and pointless dialogue it was more like 8. ""Well they need time for the manga to catch up!!!"" I hear your rant, but I personally would rather them just have a larger season or beef up the story with relevant filler. And this series treats us so dumb, like how could they possibly hope we would believe there was outside civilization? Or like ""man these titans sure look humanoid?"" and not believe that once introduced we already knew what they were. Like I feel this whole season could disappear and season 3 comes out just put like 6 extra episodes in and that would have been all we needed. Ive talked on this long enough msg me if you wanna talk more.
Art-10 
No argument, show looks great massive production value here, probably exceeds some African country GDP.
Sound-8
Again no argument, massive production value show sounds good (I personally love the intro music)
Character-5
Boom I said it. They blow ass. No character has a unique or enjoyable personality among them. They all have weak personalities with no growth over these 2 seasons. While not true for this show, but for all the other AoT ripoffs Wit studios has made. The main trio is just a generic copy paste formula for their studio. The ""villains"" of this series are actually more likable. Eren himself is beyond empty, he is a void that sucks away on the characters around him. Of the main trio perhaps Armin is the ""best"" and by that I mean most rounded and questioning. Mikasa is just an empty power house. All she does is fiend for erin and kill titans. This is not me saying I hate op characters, I don't I like them more. But what they did here was try to put in ""romance""? I honestly don't know where this is going but one of the most frustrating things for me as a viewer to see is unrequited love. I hate seeing Mikasa smell erin in his sleep he wakes up walks away say i wanna kill titans? Like I have no idea what they were aiming for? Aside from the main trio you have an army of unknown names and forgettable faces. This series is known for being ""gritty"" ""horrific"" and ""deep"" but its hard to feel these emotions for characters who A) you have no idea who they are. B) they scream terrified all the time and just die? C) You like the titans more than the humans by the end. I found myself so disconnected from the characters solely because they were so one sided and bland. Basically the were all red shirts from star trek, like cmon no one felt bad when they died right? So then why should I care for these no name legion recruits. Again with the story there are so many flaws and holes with these bland one sided characters, if you have a gripe msg me.
Enjoyment/Overall-5
Just because of the weak story, ass characters, and just a total disconnect of emotion from a hailed ""deep, gritty story"" that took 4 years to make and was completely underwhelming just had me holding my head in confusion. I watched the first season and loved it but that was 4 years ago I'm not a teenager who saw blood and thought the show was deep now like many out there, I need either plot or titties and this offered neither. This left me very disappointed in Wit studios as a whole. They put so much time into their other garbage ripoffs that I believe this suffered because of that didvided focus.",5
"
                The first two seasons of this fantasy epic went hard. With all the leg-work done by the first season to establish the setting and the themes at play, this season was just free to go completely off the rails insane with how far they could push the limits of that setting. Very slowly we start to be drip fed answers to all the questions that have been raised, but each one only brings dozens more questions. Who is the real enemy of humanity? What is the driving force behind Reiner and Bertolt's betrayal? We get no real answers here but I gotta say it's so
                  satisfying on a rewatch after knowing everything.
This is the brilliant kind of storytelling you don't see a lot in anime, or really any kind of media anymore. With the disaster that was the Star Wars sequel trilogy, western audiences have come to expect stories that were written haphazardly with no direction and no outline for the overarching narrative. Anime, because of it's often very serialized nature, can also fall into that messy territory of feeling like the writers have no clue what they're doing and are just jumping from idea to idea with no sense of where they are actually headed. You see none of that here. This is a story that has such a natural flow and progression, such a finite sense from the outset that the author knows all the answers to the questions being posed, that the story already has an outcome and we're just along for the ride of slowly uncovering it.
So many iconic moments, an amazing soundtrack that gives even greater impact to them, and a cast of characters that are all so freaking awesome it's actually painful when you remember any one of them could die at any moment. This season pulls a lot of it's punches in regard to killing off main characters. A lot of people still die, but it's almost like they go out of their way to make sure it's nobody we care about too much. There's one obvious exceptions of major characters dying horrifically toward the end, but those death flags were so obvious I felt embarrassed I didn't see it coming the first time around.
So for my score I wasn't sure I would rate this season as high as the first. I was waiting to fully rewatch the season to make my decision, and upon completion I can say it keeps pace with season 1 in every way. The show has so much momentum by this point and just keeps ramping up higher and higher, every episode leaving you wanting more. 10/10 perfect score, and the series goes on.",10

                i was really looking forward to the second season of Shingeki no Kyojin, however i was in an unpleasant surprise because i was disappointed in the lack of fighting scenes and well executed combat scene, as shown in the last season.
The Plot was balanced around their politics and was well executed in this section.
Shingeki no Kyojin
The second season of Shingeki no Kyojin is nothing for me and if you are into fighting animes, its nothing for you either. The production quality of Attack on Titan's second season is a major downgrade from the first's. I really did not enjoy watching the second season compared to
                  the exitement i felt when i watched the first season.
To sum it all up nothing was particularly well done. The story and  execution was decent and sometimes underperforming.",4

                Attack on Titan's rewatch marathon continues with another intense season plagued with some of the best, most shocking moments of the whole anime so far. More pieces are added to the puzzle, and at the same time, more questions are formulated.
Story:
This season, which streamed four years after the end of the first one (I can't imagine waiting four years for this), takes place right after the events of its previous finale. The story here takes a darker tone and presents new threats to the remaining humanity inside the walls. The strong point here is the way it's narrated, surprising you and making you binge-watch the
                  whole season in less than two days. Most of the events here are completely unexpected and shocking, and I'm not using the word ""shocking"" lightly.
I have to admit, as much as I love this season, even after watching it three times, the truth is it doesn't have much story. There's no storyline that takes you from point A to point B. Almost the entirety of the events in these twelve episodes happen in the span of no more than two days, and it's nothing more than that: shocking events happening one after the other. Is that a bad thing? Not at all. Still, I can understand why people watching this anime gave up and dropped it after this season. Presenting more questions and offering cryptic half-answers might not be enough for those picky watchers who can't take the intrigue and mystery this show is so well known for. If you really want answers, you need to watch season three. Now.
Characters:
One of the things I loved from this season is the way they put the main characters aside and focused on developing some side characters. Eren, Mikasa, and Armin took a backseat and gave Sasha, Connie, Krista, Ymir, Reiner, and Bertolt some space and time to further develop and get to know them more. The thing I love about this is the fact that some of these characters I just mentioned were used as comical relief in the first season, and seeing them being the focus of not just one episode but almost half of the season is simply amazing. And it's not simply giving them some subplot, some of them are now an essential piece in the whole story. 
Of course, Eren, Mikasa, and Armin are still important, but they don't get much development. Still, they have some really important moments that will impact their further development.
Art:
Attack on Titan's popularity was also mostly influenced by its great animation and design. And even four years after, this season maintains its quality. It even feels more polished. Not only the animation is incredibly fluid, but even the still frames look good, with a nice style of lines and on-point lighting and rendering.
Sound:
Hiroyuki Sawano keeps doing his magic here. New epic songs and leitmotivs are added to the already epic and emotional soundtrack we know and love. Songs like Apetitan, Barricades, Youseebiggirl, and The Weight of Lives play during some of the best scenes, turning them memorable and making you play those songs in your head even after the credits roll.
And talking about credits, that Ending song is so creepy, and even to this day, I have no idea what is the meaning of the images we see behind the credits.
I still have the same issue I had with season 1. Even though I love Barricades and Call of Silence, I think the English lyrics don't fit in this soundtrack. They could have played an instrumental/orchestral version of those songs and the scenes would still have the same impact and emotion they already had. Maybe even more.
Enjoyment:
When I watched this season for the first time, I was blown away. I even binge-watched it in 2-3 days, even though I wanted to go slowly with it. The same happened the second time I watched it. This time, I forced myself to go slowly, even watching other anime in between, and I kept a more objective mind than in my initial experience. I remember I cried the first time. That didn't happen now, but it still made me choke up and blurred my eyes a bit. The shocking moments are still so enjoyable even knowing what's about to happen.
Overall:
This season of Attack on Titan has everything the first one had and made it so popular four years before: incredible animation, epic soundtrack, an intriguing story with shocking moments, and some very well developed characters. Still, the story this time fills more like a series of intense events string together rather than having a whole arc throughout these twelve episodes. And if you are eager to find answers, you'll be glad to know you still have the third season to find them.",10

                The 2nd Season of Attack on Titan really expands everything on the first. You learn more about other characters and the story gets more complex in a good way. There are twists that have reason to them and not just for fun. The artstyle I believe also improved its just that personally I am not really a fan of 3D in 2D Anime which this season has quite a bit more. The characters are just as good and every character I feel has just gotten better. I would have liked to see Eren do a bit more but his main fight as a titan was
                  really good in this show. Overall I really enjoyed it its great.",9

                ""We're not talking about eternal truth, or absolute truth, or ultimate truth, we're talking about impermanent, transient, human truth.""
That's a quote from the movie Network that I think sums up what was really going on during this season of Attack on Titan. What has changed from 12 episodes before to 12 episodes after is not so much the details of how Titans exist or other broad questions that explain how to defeat them or the history of the world, or even what exactly is the plan of Reiner and Bertholdt. There's basically as much intrigue by the end of the season as there was at
                  the end of season 1. So no ultimate truth has been learned, but some transient truth has. Attack on Titan has had problems with characterization, it's probably it's biggest fault, but it had more character history with episodes on Sasha, Connie, Reiner and Bertholdt, and Ymir and Historia (Krista is more fitting imo, but so be it). It was the season of revealing your inner self and fighting because of that. That struggle with identity drove the action this season and it's an interesting change of pace from season 1.
I've heard and seen things over the years of what's gone on with the story of AoT, but from my memory it remained in its more simple season 1 form, which felt like Naruto or something like that. There is a group of skilled, teenage, fighters, who grow and learn about themselves and each other as they fight some larger foe and try to make the world a better place because of it. In season 1, it seemed like they would go from a nervous peace to a near extinction event, before at least getting a draw with Eren's titan powers. And then in season 2 would be the slow reclamation of the old land, find what's in the basement, and keep fighting from there. That did not happen. More people revealed themselves to be titans, and have splintered off into different groups and ideas regarding some larger, unknown plot related to Eren's dad and how titans are made. That may not work for some people as a story, but it's interesting and something I haven't seen in shonen anime like this.
It reminds me of one of the more famous shots from season 1. Eren, just graduated from the Training Corps, standing on top of the wall, camera comes close to his confident smirk, ""everything's gonna work out in the end."" And then, boom, Colossal Titan appears right behind him and wreaks havoc. That's how season 2 has felt to me, keeping up with different groups during a long two-day stretch of fighting and desperation. I like it a lot and the great OP and amazing ED with its medieval style and music really cap it off to me.",10

                The show starts to get more interesting here, but I think it's on par with the first season on quality. More traitors seem to be among their ranks, and the stakes seem to be getting higher. It's interesting, this season is much more focused on specific characters and certain story lines, taking a step back from the intense action which was present in the first season. it's more laid back to put it succinctly, although I wonder if this really makes it better or worse than the first season.
It's also a measly 12 episodes, but this is fine. It is it's own story and season
                  in it's own right which doesn't require a prat 2. I can't imagine waiting 4 years after the first season for this one though, I don't know what took them so long lmao.
I like the focuses on the characters of Reiner and Ymir in particular, they have much more depth here and are explored well, alongside Reiner's sidekick Bertholt. Or Berdtholt. Or however you spell it.
**Indirect spoilers**
The final battle is pretty badass, and emotional. I like the confessing at the end, and then the weird almost deus ex machina moment lmao. It works well, but I wish that confession developed into something more later which it didn't.
**Indirect spoilers over**
It's a good continuation, and sets up for more interesting seasons in the future. You have to watch it if you've seen the first season, and of course it makes no sense watching it without having seen the first one. Anyway, season two gets a 7/10.",7
