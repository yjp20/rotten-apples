Does fantastic animation trump mediocre writing? When it comes down to it, can you ignore one to enjoy the other?
As for Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, most of the anime community falls into one of two extremes. Either they love it for the amazing animation, an abundance of horrifying villains, and incredible fight choreography—or they hate it for subpar storytelling, shallow character writing, and unfunny comedy. The truth is somewhere in between. Demon Slayer has some of the best animation of this generation, but I can’t recommend the entire show because the writing is… pretty bad.
Our hero, no older than
                  fifteen, carries his dying sister as he trudges through a snowstorm, crying out in anguish. Soon after, we flashback to before everything went wrong. We are greeted with a loving family. The scene is saturated with brilliant light reflecting off the snow-covered ground, angels singing with hopeful music. They are going to die. All of them. The cold-open is completely unnecessary. It is obvious this family with zero characteristics other than ‘happy’ will be killed. Violently. The lone survivor, Tanjiro, inevitably leaves them; now that his father is deceased, he is the designated man of the family. Upon his return, he finds his family viciously murdered. Demon Slayer never shies away from violence, and we learn this immediately. Blood soaked with horrific expressions, children protecting one another in their final moments, it’s all the more effective because their deaths are left to our imagination. Tanjiro stares in terror, speed lines on either side of the screen. Aside from the maximum shock factor of a happy family being slaughtered, there’s little reason to care. If you need speed lines to convey the protagonist’s severity finding his family violently murdered, you need to rewrite the scene and start over. It plays out so predictably, and we still know nothing about him other than he was part of the happy family. He carries away the only survivor, his sister Nezuko, barely clinging to life. Soon she becomes the monster that killed her—a demon. Tanjiro vows to avenge his family and cure his sister, by becoming a DEMON SLAYER!! It practically writes itself; a horrific monster-of-the-week for the heroes to fight off, and it works. As the demonic threats become bigger threats, Tanjiro becomes a more capable fighter. There’s a real sense of progression.
Before his family was killed, Tanjiro hadn’t fought at all. Somehow he barely knew what demons were. Demons are enough of a threat in this world that there are demon-hunting squads, yet this family didn’t know about them. Thankfully through a lucky coincidence, Tanjiro gains new powers in a training montage. There was no character progression, but at least there was lots of pretty animation. Nezuko, despite essentially being a lobotomized demon, is trained to believe ‘humans good, demons bad’. Not only is this a cheap way to avoid writing character development, but it also raises even more questions with the internal logic. If people can hypnotize demons to be good, why is this the only time we see it happen? Rather than integrating this information into the story, it is dumped onto us during an action scene as if the author forgot to mention it in a prior chapter.
Time after time, the action is undercut by the awkward dialogue. For example, a disembodied head demon ties it’s hair to Tanjiro’s weapon, then it is flung away and gets stuck to a tree. It struggles, then it says aloud exactly what we saw happen “I wrapped my hair around his hatchet to grab it but it got tangled up!” We could easily assume this from the shot composition and body language. Constant inner monologues, flashbacks, unnecessary comments, and awkward pauses bring the action to a screeching halt. One of the most egregious moments is when Tanjiro angrily stares at his friend being beaten up. Two minutes later, he finally yells and tries to intervene, cut to the ED before anything happens. They’re like five feet apart for two whole minutes, and then it just ends. Early on, this was one of the main reasons many people dropped Kimetsu no Yaiba. Show don’t tell is a rule that Ufotable can follow; their staff is loaded with talent and an unlimited budget. Being a manga adaptation, the moment-to-moment descriptions are necessary to supplement what the paperback art can’t depict. However, a high-budget adaptation like this does not need superfluous descriptions. I frequently felt like I was watching an action movie with someone who pauses it once a minute to comment on what’s happening.
About two-thirds of Demon Slayer is action scenes, and one-third is jarringly out-of-place comedy. When it works, it is a stunning spectacle; the heroes run through the dark moonlit forest chasing after vicious demons, orchestral music excellently hypes up any scene, then the breathtaking fight choreography. The background art is beautiful, occasionally the CGI backgrounds are jarring. Thick lines around the character designs make them (usually) feel suited against the realistic backgrounds. Both the demons and heroes have iconic designs with distinct color pallets. I didn’t notice a single shot with off-model character art. During action scenes, the use of CGI character models allowed for dynamic 3D camera movements, unlike anything I’ve seen since Ufotable’s Fate/Zero. Occasionally, CGI models were unnecessarily used at a distance, it was still distracting.
Suspension of disbelief is bent to the point of breaking in many of the action scenes, but many find it hard to criticize them because they’re so damn entertaining to watch. Every time he unleashes his water breathing technique, I was always in awe; the painterly ink-like waves with lush blues juxtaposed against the photorealistic background look cool every single time. He has tons of different water breathing styles, each with different animations and usages. A basic slash, then combos, a 360-degree slash, and a mercifully quick painless slash to name a few. The whole water breathing technique that he uses to fight is awesome, even if the logic behind it is a bit vague. As it is described in the show, you inhale deeply, and it gets your blood excited! So what does that really mean? Even he says, “I still don’t get it.” On the other hand, what’s less forgivable is Tanjiro’s super-powered nose. Even before he trains, he has this unbelievable ability. He smells emotions, he smells demons from a mile away, and he smells the invisible thread that allows him to make such accurate attacks. There are other unexplained abilities like super hearing; these kids are essentially the lamest heroes from My Hero Academia, except with no in-world explanation for their powers. Demon Slayer takes many shortcuts when writing its story and characters. If only those flaws didn’t permeate through the best part of the show, I might have been able to recommend it.
Tanjiro is a good person. His ideals are unshakable. He fights for his family, he throws himself into danger to save total strangers, he even comforts the demons’ tortured souls after slaying them. The problem is, he’s too good. His ideals rarely come into question. After seeing a few randos get murdered, he learns that not everyone can be saved. However, nothing breaks him. Unlike most monster-slaying main characters, his morals never blur the lines between becoming what he is fighting against. As a shounen hero, he is what you expect, an unequivocally good person. That’s why he’s such a boring protagonist. Motivated solely by his desire to slay demons and save his sister, his personality is essentially a blank slate for the audience to project onto. Unfortunately, he’s the best character we’ve got. Nezuko, as adorable as she is, has next to no lines of dialogue. Other demons can speak, for some reason, she is gagged with a stick. During the daytime, she waits within Tanjiro’s wooden box to avoid being burnt, only coming out when it is convenient for the plot. When her brother is outnumbered against stronger foes, she jumps out and decapitates demons with a dive kick. It’s badass… but their unlikely partnership doesn’t make much sense within the story’s internal logic. In the first episode, Nezuko is a vicious demon, prepared to eat her brother, and somehow unlike any other demon in the show, she can stop herself. Not even four episodes later, we see another kid-turned-demon immediately forget about his siblings and eat them (and he’s also able to speak immediately). She exists solely to motivate Tanjiro to save her, and that constantly made me think, “Why?” Why does he need to make her human? She’s in full control of her demon form, she’s insanely powerful, she doesn’t need that gag, and if she were a human, she would have died fighting alongside her brother. There are kindhearted demons in this show, people who were saved from death by being turned, so why is it such an issue? All I ask for is a story that remains true to its internal logic. She’s lobotomized and nonverbal, but look at this cute demon girl crouching in a basket!
The emotional payoffs lack the impact the visceral presentation they deserve. Right before or after a ‘boss’ demon is killed, we always see a flashback to make us sympathize with them. Trying to get the audience to care about a villain minutes (sometimes seconds) before they die just doesn’t work. They have already lost the fight; who cares if they had a tough childhood if we’ll never see them again? Like most of the emotional payoffs in this show, there is beautiful background music to carry the lacking script, most notably the insert song in episode nineteen. Without the music, the writing isn’t enough. All of the ‘development’ for the main characters happens in flashbacks too. Nezuko gets next to nothing. In the latter half of the show, the script has less time to be redundant. Instead, it’s replaced with comedy. I hoped the other characters shown in the OP/ED would be a lot better. Oh, how I was disappointed once Zenitsu was introduced. If there’s anyone who likes Demon Slayer for the humor more than the action, violence, artwork, and music, I’d sure like to ask them why. The characters are around fifteen years old, and that’s who the humor would appeal to. Over exaggerated reactions, crying, yelling. So. Much. Yelling. Zenitsu almost exclusively speaks with a shrill yelling voice. The few battles he fights alone are so frustrating that I was rooting for the demons. His defining character trait is ‘coward’. He does get a flashback eventually that still does nothing to explain why he is so annoying. Nearly all of the humor in Demon Slayer is jarringly placed right next to series moments. People get violently killed, then within seconds, cut to the main characters in a cartoony art style doing a slapstick routine. In a series as dark as this one, levity is necessary to a certain extent; however, it feels like the author tried to make the mature themes more accessible to a younger audience by using drastic tonal shifts from horror to humor. The maligned tone made the show less scary to me, but only because it was so all-over-the-place that I could barely tell what tone they were aiming for most of the time.
Tanjiro sees his family in flashbacks when he needs motivation in a fight. In the climactic moment of the entire show, he gets a new ability retconned into the story through a flashback. Many argue it was foreshadowed in the ED⁠—however, the flashback explains a new storyline that gives Tanjiro a new power—a retcon. Inosuke is here too, he doesn’t do a whole lot, but he has more relevance than Nezuko, at least. Zenitsu and Inosuke are the most expendable characters. In the final arc, we get the most stilted dialogue in the entire series. A dozen new characters get introduced, each with one gimmick to their personalities. Overly cute, overly angry, completely nonverbal, they added nothing but fluff. Demon Slayer began with a roar but ended with a whimper. Even though it was poorly written, the stunning animation and grimdark aesthetic kept me entertained; it’s a shame they threw most of that out the window for filler and unfunny comedy in the final few episodes.
Either you will think this is one of the best shounen anime ever created, or you will think it has some of the worst writing in a big-budget anime to date. Perhaps even somewhere in between. You could skim a Wikipedia summary of the story, then watch all the action scenes on YouTube and you’d lose nothing. I’ll ask you one more time, are you willing to deal with bad writing to enjoy fantastic animation?

                Ah ufotable, the studio that keeps on giving. Before Kimetsu no Yaiba aired, news broke out that we’d get them animating the show. And to my delight, it’s a studio that earned its praise for its high caliber animation and consistently delivering quality content. Being their first 2-cour show (without a split cour break), Kimetsu no Yaiba is a special gift not just for the manga fans but anyone ready to experience a world of demons and dark fantasy.
With over 170 chapters and counting, manga artist Koyoharu Gotouge made this series as a dark fantasy-adventure about demons. With 26 episodes, there are some concerns about
                  how much content we’d actually get adapted. For statistical references, each episode adapts about 3 chapters. Most of the episodes follows these chapters by the letter and to manga fans, I think this is a special treat. Not too manga series follows this trend and some unfortunately decides to jump off the rail and follow its own path. With that being said, Kimetsu no Yaiba is a series that I recommend and there’s plenty reasons to see why.
The experience of watching this show goes beyond the realm of its visual quality. Ufotabe applied their cinematic style to bring the characters and story to life but it’s important to realize what the author wanted to bring from his work. From the start, the show had a vision. It sets up a state of tragedy that deals with life and death. The demons in this show are devices created with the purpose to generate fear, the type of feeling that viewers needs to experience when watching a dark fantasy. Often these days, I find myself feeling bored when watching dark fantasies when it relies too much on relationship developments. Instead, Kimetsu no Yaiba elegantly tells a story that’s straightforward yet meaningful to deliver its premise. We meet main protagonist Tanjiro Kamado, a determined demon slayer who stops at nothing to help find a cure for his sister, Nezuko. The first few episodes establishes their important character relationship as even with Nezuko being a demon, he refuse to kill her. In return, Nezuko uses her own skills to help Tanjiro when he is in trouble fighting demons on his own. Early episodes also shows Tanjiro learning the ropes as a demon slayer. The anime makes it clear about the reality of their world where death is common and can happen in the brink of an eye. If you don’t believe me, just take a look at what happens to Tanjiro’s family. With such a tragic setup, the anime seeks to bring hope for Tanjiro and his journey to make things better for his only remaining family.
In remembering the past, Kimetsu no Yaiba is known for showing the importance of family. Known for showing rather than telling, it should be easy to see the close relationship Tanjiro has with his sister, mother, and father. Throughout the show, Tanjiro is also known for his duty to eliminate demons although he doesn’t truly hate all of them. Rather than having a black and white philosophy, he also feels sympathy for some of the demons he faces. However, there is one demon he both fears and despises – the mysterious and powerful Kibutsuji Muzan. As the primary antagonist of the show, he is also the catalyst of tragic events in Tanjiro’s life. Let’s face the reality here: he killed Tanjiro’s family and is responsible in making Nezuko into a demon. How can Tanjiro not hate this demon? As a cold-hearted and manipulative personality, Kibutsuji is one of Tanjiro’s main obstacles to overcome during this dark fantasy adventure. Unfortunately, we don’t get too much inside scoop on Kibutsuji’s character besides what he shows on the surface. The anime limited itself with adapting his story but it’s still shown that he is one, if not the most dangerous antagonist in this show.
With the premise of demon slaying, there’s plenty of room for other characters to get their own spotlights. Some of the more prominent names include Zenitsu Agatsuma, Inosuke Hashibira, and Genya Shinazugawa. The author made these characters with conflicting personalities to bring more value to their roles. For instance, Zenitsu is initially portrayed as a coward but over time, he conquers his fears and learns to accept his role as a demon slayer. Inosuke is known for his fierce personality and competitive persona. While the show doesn’t develop his character as much as the others, he brings a unique form of fighting and charisma. And we shouldn’t forget about Genya since he first appeared in the show. Known for its foul mouth and killing desire, one should wonder how much he can really fit the role as a demon slayer. It helps that Kimetsu no Yaiba features a diverse cast of characters who are all unique on their own. On the other hand, the same principle may not apply entirely for the demons. Truth to be told, most of the demons in the show has a rather one sided personality. Most of them are known for their bloodlust and urge to kill. It’s a primary factor that can make the demons more forgettable compared to the human characters. Outside of Kibutsuji, it’s really hard to say any of these demons are actually worth remembering for this adaptation. If in the future when this gets more animated episodes, they could be worth mentioning.
Yet, ufotable is well worth mentioning again for their stellar animation and character work. It seems throughout the show, there isn’t one instance where an episode suffered quality. It manages to consistently adapt battle scenes with stylistic and cinematic choreography. Character movements aren’t wasted but instead used to showcase the different fighting styles of the cast. The show also uses a realistic environment of snow and mountains to show the harsh conditions of surviving in the wilderness. The demon designs are made with menacing elements from their aggressive nature to their killing expressions. At the same time, the anime also has room for humor with over the top character emotive performances especially from Zenitsu. Even Tanjiro himself has moments where you can’t easily forget. If there’s something to take away from this show, it’s ufotable and the director’s impressive work. They earned this praise. If you don't believe me, watch episode 19 and see for yourself.
And it’s not only that either. Music and the soundtrack used in this show creates a thrilling atmosphere. In early episodes, I could feel the show being able to tell its story by its melancholic soundtrack alone. When you take the fact of the cast being able to make the characters into life, it really sends a strong impression. The OP song “Gurenge” by LISA carries a sensational aura with its visual storytelling while the ED theme “from the edge” contains a feeling of serenity and loneliness. 
Kimetsu no Yaiba is like a love letter to dark fantasy adventure fans. Based on financial reports, the first week had sold over 11k copies while the manga also enjoys a decent success. It’s not too often to see this type of series succeed but I’m so glad it’s on this road. With ufotable behind the wheels as its studio, this is no pushover when it comes to technical quality. The characters and storytelling are meaningful to its premise while maintain an aura of mystique. We really need more adaptations like Kimetsu no Yaiba.",9,Stark700

                This is your typical Shounen anime but done damn right.
The story is somewhat new in a sense and character location or setting I would say is also kind of new to me in shounen anime, I am saying this because now days shounen anime always start in a city or suburb areas. Its nice to see this anime start the story from middle of nowhere kind of setting (given this anime takes place in past, its not new but different in my opinion).
The action scenes are jaw dropping and are something you would rewind the few seconds of that scene to see again. Tanijro as
                  a character is also breath of fresh air in this shounen setting, because he do not have lofty goals like becoming king of pirates or something like that, he just wants to turn his sister back to human form once again and he do not rely on friendship power or activating his fourth gear on or going ssj 3, nope he trains like any other human being to earn his power. Directing on this anime is also fascinating, you can tell that director cut no corner for fight scenes(like one other anime I know, looking at you OPM S2) and he went with full force to animate those gorgeous fight scenes. 
The only tiny bit problem is that occasional use of CG models of characters when they are far in the view or are fast moving, but this use of CG is ten times better than what we got for goblin slayer. When its comes to using CG studio Ufotable is leagues ahead in the competition and it shows here. 
This is only anime I am enjoying, which is doing action scenes right. Give it a try you will enjoy it.",9,The-Observer95

                Oh boy, the seasonal battle shounen that everyone raves about, what does it do right? Well to be completely honest, nothing, the only thing it got going for it is the production quality from ufotable.
Story: 2 (contains spoilers up to ep 19)
There's really nothing special here, the series starts out with Tanjirou's family got devouvered by demons and his sister Nezuko got turned into one. In order to save his sister and turn her human again he set out to find Muzan Kibutsuji the original demon who surely has some way of turning Nezuko human again. In order to get to him he needs to
                  be strong and fight a lot of demons thus he becomes a demon slayer. After this set up he just fights demons every episode and honestly it gets tiring fast. They decide to fix this repetitiveness by introducing two other main characters who are extremely obnoxious and later by introducing a spider demon who's several times more powerful than Tanjirou and the demons we've seen prior. However the way they handle this demon is done in the worst way possible, first to showcase how powerful he is when Tanjirou goes to cut his spider thread it is the sword that is cut instead and after getting destroyed by the demon, he has a flashback and pulls out a breathing technique called dance of the fire god from his ass, he then oblitirates his opponent with his sword whose blade is now half the length of the hilt. After this I completely gave up on the series, Fairy Tail has better writing than this.
Art / Animation: 8
The reason this series got popular in the first place, I have to admit it's beautiful and the fight scenes are fantastic, I do have a minor issue whenever I see CG Tanjirou walking around but it's otherwise fantastic.
Sound: 6
There's really nothing to complain about but there's not much to praise either. The music is solid and gets the job done but it's also unmemorable. The've assambled an absolutely fantastic voice cast but their roles don't alow for them to shine, the only exeptional voice performance is from Saori Hayami as Shinobu.
Characters: 0
The absolute worst part of the show, pretty much all the characters are as flat as a piece of cardboard with a single character trait, for many of them this character trait is also extremely obnoxious. Tanjirou is your standard shounen protagonist, overly righteous with a strong sense of comradery, honestly a really boring character that we've all seen a hundred times before so that he still ends up being one of the best characters in the show is speaking volumes about the rest of the cast. Nezuko is cute and that's it, apart from protecting Tanjirou a handful of times she hasn't done anything apart from looking cute she's also one of the better characters in the show. Inosuke is stupid, loud and obnoxious and tries to solve everything by beating stuff up, that's it there's nothing else to his character. Zenitsu is one of the worst characters I've seen in any medium, he's the biggest coward ever and his constant screaming makes you want to tear your hair off. Giyuu seems like a passable character on par with Tanjirou but I haven't found a reason to actually like him. Shinobu would be the most intersting character so far but she appears too robotic in her mission ''demon bad, gotta kill demon''. If she actually listened to Giyuu but still come to the same conclusion I wouldn't have a problem. Also she's a woman so of course she has to be too weak to sever the head of a demon, her sword and poison is cool and all but come on, find a better reason, it's pretty clear that strength is not the key component in severing the head of a demon in this universe. The rest of the pilars hasn't had much screentime but they've made an awful first impression, they've all been shows to have a single exaggerated character trait and nothing else.
Enjoyment: 0
Boring plot with obnoxious characters that drive you insane leads to an absolutely abysmal level of enjoyment on par with staring into a wall while listening to a screaming baby for 10 hours.
Overall: 1
To me this is the perfect example of style over substance and goes to show that as long as something has flashy fight scenes it's very likely to be loved by the anime community. If you're not already a big battle shounen fan who's able to watch a series for the action sakuga alone stay far away from this series.",1,Roevhaal

                I've just watch 6 episodes but I think it's necessary to do a review of this.
Kimetsu no Yaiba has a great story. In a nutshell, it's about a guy named Tanjirou with a sister who was the unique survivor to a massacre of a demon to their family but she turned into one and it's Tanjirou's mission find a way to return humanity to his sister. 
The art is really AWESOME, we can see this in every episode with the detailed desing of the characters, the background and landscapes. The draw style is outstanding even in the little bonus at the end of every chapter.
It
                  has a strong and stunning opening that goes according to the story and an OST which remarks every important scene. The ending is remarkable too.
Every character have their inner story, Tanjiro and his family and the others with their past.
I really enjoy every episode of this. Although it sounds exaggerated it makes me feel alive with every sensation it gives to me.
In overall I give this anime a 10/10 because is perfect in every way. Probably the best of this season.
Watch it! I'm sure you will enjoy it.",10,Tsukihi_Phoenix

                [Spoiler Warning]
I'm sorry I won't be able to review everything, but I'm at the 7th episode now and I can't keep watching. I convinced myself to keep watching just to laugh it out, but the show is so inconsistent and poor that it drove me mad.
Kimetsu no Yaiba starts out with the carbon copy shonen ""failproof"" formula. Tragedy that fuels progress for the protagonist. This time, it's demons attacking and slaughtering most of his family. In his state of despair upon finding the corpses, our MC Tangerine is coldblooded enough to check whose body is still hot enough to be alive, potentially. he doesn't need
                  a second to process everything. Screw that. He picks up his sister, who happens to be that. As he's on his way to the village, his sister jumps up, and much to Tangerine's surprise, the sister was converted to a demon. After their battle, the sister, Nezuko, hesitates to deliver the finishing blow. So Nezuko still has some consciousness. It fits in with the formula, perfect. Then a Demon Killer arrives at the scene to kill Nezuko. Tangerine stops him with a smart trick since he apparently knows that he can't beat the Demon Killer. Smart protagonists are cool, nice. Or so I'd say, but he actually isn't one. 
You see, Tangerine has a few special abilities. One is to be smart only at certain situations. Other times, he's not so bright. Another ability of his is the ability to smell. He seems to have a great sense of smell, so great that he can smell out openings in an enemy's posture, and visualize it to a line connecting his blade to the enemy. His final ability is to breathe. Yes, breathe. He can breathe to improve his body's healing rate, his muscles strength, and his speed.  Oh sorry, I might've disrespected the show here. He doesn't JUST breathe. He breathes deeply, so that... *checks notes*...the air reaches all the cells in his body. Yup. Deep breathing, people. It's a superpower. 
Tangerine is also established to be ""empathetic towards demons"". How different! He is able to be empathetic towards them since his sister is also one, wow! Or so I'd say, but we are able to see that he has no problems slashing a Demon's both arms in combat even though he knows that a demon isn't killed until he slashes the neck. The demon then talks about how little girls are tasty, and Tangerine also has no problems slashing the demon's tongue then. Great empathy! Great job, Mr. Justice!
Another thing that amazes me is how quickly Tangerine acknowledges that he must slay demons to heal his sister. He must fight powerful demons of nightmares, the beings that he somehow has empathy for even though they killed his entire family, but then again the show said ""fuck go back"" to that empathy. Why doesn't he chicken out and just try to look for a way to heal his sister, and then realize that he must be a demon slayer to do so? That is the most normal response. But of course, Tangerine, Mr. Justice, xXxDemonSLayer3169xXx needs to time for such emotional garbage. So much so that when his master tells that he brainwashed Nezuko to hate demons and love humans, he shows no response. Okay, cool. Just brainwash my sister, yeah. 
You sticked this far? Great! Because here's a shock, Tangerine actually has a fourth special power: the power to see the undead. He saw, talked to, and trained with his master's dead disciples. How cool! Great job, Tangerine! I wonder how the story will cover that up! Here's a guess though: Their will was so strong that they had to watch over the next disciple to make sure he didn't die to the demon boss of the training arc. I bet 50 Turkish Lira for that. It's a dying currency, but whatever.
And, that is all that I remember about to talk shit about in Kimetsu no Yaiba. However, the studio did a well job drawing and animating the show. While the soundtrack is sometimes out of place, the drawing is breathtaking. It's sometimes CGI-ish in the first few episodes, but following tht is awesome animation with an aesthetic that fits the show's time period and aesthetic perfectly, since waves are used a lot in Edo-Meiji Japanese culture.
Overall, the show is extremely poor. The characters are also bland and inconsistent, However you get used to that after trying to keep up with the story, which is also of similar nature. But of course, that is just my opinion. Please watch a few episodes yourself before arriving at a conclusion. Here are my Ratings of everything;

                Only cynical criticism can save us from the gooey sentimentality and naivete, but sometimes rarely a series too precious to deserve this treatment appears, offering nothing but genuine entertainment to a point where its own shortcomings start to seem very insignificant compared to its strongest merits. I may have a soft spot in my heart for this series, but all the things I found to be problematic within the work are still covered here in this review and explained why I think they can be forgiven, because even with all of its problems, this is -in its own way- one of the greatest series seen
                  in the era of modern anime.
The story itself is nothing to write home about. Boy experiences a dramatic event which entirely rewrites his life, after which he starts walking this path that is the combination of ongoing rescue arc and revenge tale. I wrote this sentence in about 6 seconds, and I assume the writer did his version in the same time. If you remove the script, what is left is quite an awful idea on paper. Had the show been done by any other studio, it'd have great potential to be unwatchable. But it's made by ufotable. And they remind us of one of the basic philosophies of anime that goes as follows: Anime is exactly as good as its execution. Which, in this case, is something that very accurate matches the definition of ""epic"". This is one of the rare series where the obscure statement ""doing it right"" can have universal meaning, because from artistic point of view, there is not much room for different interpretations.
A lot can be said about the animation and art, but perhaps the most essential part is how immersive they are. The visual style can be absorbed to such extent that there is no room for multitasking or side-tracking. Every frame is like a painting, and every sequence and scene delivers because they have been polished beyond belief. Due to this, the series deserves 100% of its viewer's attention. This is the type of content that makes it hard to look away from the tv screen, because if you do, you're likely to miss something amazing. Overall, the quality combines things from 3 highest peaks of anime art. From it's color scheme and art design, Yaiba, at its best, can be compared to Katanagatari (which, I personally consider to be the highest peak of raw art in anime, and I don't compare anything to it lightly). From its fluid animation during action scenes, it's not far from the best of the best AKA One Punch Man. And from the small/even subtle details, its level of polish comes close to Mahou Tsukai no Yome. Seeing all of these combined and come to life inside a series that follows the classic shonen formula and maintains its quality for two continuous cours is something I never expected from this industry: it's simply not realistic to await something this outstanding/this beautiful to come, and because of this, the series is not less than a masterpiece from its artistic side - and becomes one of the rare must watch titles from 2019 for this reason alone.
Yaiba's music and the use of the music in action scenes is simply stunning. I wouldn't change really anything from this department. OST choices are uncommon, yet efficient and highly fitting. Among the better things from this department is not really even how good the songs sound as standalone pieces, but how well and to what extent they are used in the series. Sound mixing stands out because the job is done in such respectable manner; beats play loudly, adding to the tension and atmosphere, and further serving the immersive effect and making the series captivating. OP and ED are praise-worthy as well. As a person who owns LiSA's entire discography, I cannot be but pleased to hear her twice in almost every episode. They have been setting me in the right mood/mindset and fixing it before/in-between each episode (I marathoned this series in 2 sections instead of watching it weekly). I don't think voice acting really deserves an analysis here because the seiyuu industry is very tight and talent is consistent there, so I will just say that seiyuu choices have been smart. Most of the time the voice goes well together with the character in question, maintaining a certain harmony where the person behind the character does not stand out but, rather, fits in.
To sum up the production: Yaiba is among the highest peaks of audiovisual achievements in anime, but it doesn't only have godly production values: it also never falls into doing compromises. Moreover, anime, as a medium, has widely entered the zone of advertisement platform where original works are becoming scarce and ultimately adaptations based on manga are just a side product of the original. But Yaiba itself is an improvement over its sauce, and for this reason it has all the rights to exist and is deserving most of the praise it gets. This is very clearly a work driven by passion and love for the animated medium, and that makes all the difference in the world.
Our cast itself doesn't do anything too great at any point. Their charm really lies within what they don't do instead. In every way, the cast is non typical for a series that follows classic shonen format. Tanjirou, our main lead, is a kind soul whose lawful ""good guy traits"" are not pushed to the realism of annoying moral soldier but limited so that it only happens to a respectable, genuine extent. This dude has some chill in him, but also totally different, down-to-earth type of serious side of him exists and it can best be seen in forms of the strong bonds he has for his own sister and the friends he makes along the run. What makes following his adventure and role as the main lead so pleasant and different from the usual is his inner balance which makes scenes that resolve around him appear rather neutral, keeping the focus in the events and visual art instead of being affected by Tanjirou's personal ideals. In many ways, he seems like a nameless video game main character thru to whom the viewer (player) experiences the series (game). I found this type of character approach to offer incredible entertainment value in Yaiba's case, because the series can be its raw self instead of being a reflection of the so called ""heart"" that many shonen series are famous for.
For readable length, I will not go in depth with the other cast members, but I have found none of them annoying. Zenitsu is kind of a fujoshi bait, a real cowards and a whine even, but the way he acts out/how his personality is delivered made him my 2nd favorite character in the series. Inosuke (the boar head dude) is what Kacchan from Hero Academia should have been. Nezuko (the sister person) is just criminally cute. What I really appreciate about her is how her entire character -with its traits, behavior and personality- is told visually. Let me repeat what I already said: It's all about the execution, and it even makes the characters come alive. To briefly also cover the villains: after the beginning, lots of planning has been put into them. Not all are super memorable, but some still will be bound to be used as an example of good design by me in the future. Outside very few expectations, all of them were still enjoyable to follow in the given moment.
Since Yaiba's writing itself is not super stellar, to put it lightly, the next two paragraphs  will be covering some of its major problems as promised, and commenting on to what extent they are a problem and how&why they can be forgiven.
The first impression is incredibly bad and off putting; The first 5 episodes are hideous, the build up phase literally sucks, the prologue should've been a backstory narration at later point in time, how the story starts rolling onward rises more questions than answers, episodes 6-7 are still subpar. The start is slow and very far from impressive, the story kinda just has to exist for the events to play out, otherwise it's highly meaningless. The main character has a superpower that works as a deus ex machina thru the first cour. The comedic reliefs and strong personalities of the assisting main cast can appear impossible to tolerate for some viewers. There is a long list of reasons to not find this show as enjoyable as I did, but even when acknowledging these issues, I don't think any of them are severe enough to actually make this anime any less than great. The beginning is hard to forgive, but most of the other stuff not. After the start, the author clearly does not even attempt writing a solid main plot for the series, but instead utterly focuses on polishing these fight scenes and his characters, which essentially are the entire point of the series, writing-wise. When the series so heavily centers around them while the main story itself is a secondary factor, it doesn't become hard to actually appreciate the things that are mastered here instead of complaining about things which are besides the point when taking in consideration the bigger picture and the approach of the show. The assisting lead characters are more preference based question, but even comedic reliefs centering around these personas are more of the sort that come from within the characters, being part of their genuine personality instead of purely existing as an attempt to make the audience chance their mood/laugh, which so many similar series fail to do in genuine/believable manner. In this case, I didn't have any problems with the approach of the comedic scenes due to this reason. I could complain that some of them are unnecessary, but they still were not badly made.
The directing itself is a mixed back and inconsistent at times. It's like there is a respectable concept, but no solid means or ideas on how to deliver it, so they just kinda throw it in there without any type of build up and hope that the visuals will do the rest/carry it. For example, almost every single character introduction is just a teleportation. Dude/girl/monster appears from nowhere and be like sup. Then they fight or have a chat. That's it. There is very little vision and continuity to be seen, in fact, there is almost no content prior the main event (fight) at all. Another poor thing the series uses specially in the beginning are cheap devices that exist in purpose of adjusting the story or lead it to preferred direction. Literally NPC's appear and lead the way. They try to give an explanation, but it don't even matter, because the explanation could as well be ""literally NPC's"" and it wouldn't make a difference. These may seem like small things, but this is how the entirety of the story is constructed, developed and moved onward. It's simply not very solid way to lead the story and needs to be taken into consideration. Action-wise, the flow is splendid thanks to this very same attribute covered above, but story-wise, these events are based on coincidences, and that level of writing surely doesn't get my appreciation. As was already said: It's clear that the series doesn't even try to offer a substantial story where these events would be standing on more solid ground, and I do have to say that when there is no attempt, it cannot really be seen as a fail either. For example [[coincidence-based story events]], our mc literally just runs into a forest and meets people and monster because, for some reason, all of them are dwelling in the same place. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure gives a magnificent explanation why this happens in its story; stand users attach each others, and at the same time, there is always a possession of something physical or even mental (knowledge) that is of interest and therefore gives legit explanation why randoms meet each others in this manner. You can call it bs and not buy the explanation, but it still makes perfect sense and follows the series' own inner logic. Here it's like a bar gag. ""Soo, you come here often?""
These complains are something that I hanged onto during the worst parts (in the beginning, specifically), but after that, the series became pure art and entered the zone of genuine entertainment, having little to no annoying problems at all in the later episodes. In short: Kimetsu no Yaiba is not a flawless anime that's based on flawless writing, but it is pretty damn close to flawless art and flawless execution of its own flawed story. While appreciating imperfections may be a hard task, it's not hard at all to enjoy Yaiba for the few things which it does so incredibly well, especially when those are its main event. Now I hope that 122 episodes later, this can have its place as the 2nd best shonen anime. As a final verdict: No matter what you think of shonen anime in generally, I highly recommend giving this series a go, because Yaiba is not just a shonen done right, it's an anime done right: Art done right.",9,Karhu

                Welp...I'm late to this party! Time to review the most overrated shonen garbage of the last 5 years! Demon Slayer is an anime that absolutely EVERYONE watched last year. Except for me of course, because I was watching bad hentai to make comedy reviews on the internet! I went in with pretty damn high expectations. As of January 2020, DS is rated one of the best anime of all time on MAL and the #1 anime of all time on Kitsu. I'm dead serious! The kids on Kitsu truly think that this is the GOAT. Galactic Heroes? Ping Pong? Lain? Ashita no Joe? No! Fuck
                  that shit! Demon Slayer baby!
I went in expecting an action series SO epic that it blows your balls off and shoves them up your ass! I expected the love child of Hellsing Ultimate, Fist of the North Star, and Berserk with maybe some Shigurui and Violence Jack thrown in for good measure! The anime with SO much testosterone that Woody Allen could watch it and go into a Norse Berserker rampage, repeatedly bashing his head against a wall just to calm down!
What did I get? A very average shonen that looks pretty but is horribly written. At least RebelPanda tried to warn me about this. I just didn't listen. He's now made me a sad panda too!
So, what is Demon Slayer about? They certainly don't slay any demons. That's just a shitty translation into English. In Japanese the enemies are called Oni, but they're actually vampires. They're undead, fanged humans with vampire powers that can transform other humans by biting them and are immortal unless exposed to sunlight or decapitated with a holy weapon. They're fucking vampires! I'm going to call them that for the rest of this review.
The story starts off as shonen as possible. The main character is named Tanjiro and he's a young coal miner/charcoal merchant from a small, mountain village. At least he's a country bumkin, so he's not in middle school! One day, an old man randomly warns him that vampires exist! Later that night, his family are slaughtered by vampires. The old man wasn't a vampire BTW, that was pure coincidence because this show is horribly written. However, Tanjiro's adorable little sister Nezuko has survived and turned into a vampire! A vampire hunter immediately shows up to kill Nezuko, but Tanjiro fights against him and desperately tries to save her. While all other vampires immediately turn evil, Nezuko is able to avoid killing her brother and retains her goodness because the power of love. The vampire hunter is very impressed by the strong bond between these siblings, so he spares Nezuko and sends Tanjiro off to train under an incredibly generic kung fu master and become a vampire hunter.
As you would expect, Pai Mei is a hard bastard and puts Tanjiro through the wringer. He trains for a year and gains superhuman strength, speed, and techniques because this is a shonen. Now it's time for the vampire hunter test! The final exam involves surviving for days against hordes of high-level vampires. The test is so EXTREME and BADASS, that only 2 people have survived it in the last 50 years! The vampire hunter test has killed over 100 potential vampire hunters and thus has actually produced more vampires than hunters. Now that's what I call efficiency! Tanjiro survives of course because he's the main character and that gives him the power of plot armor!
Let's stop the plot summary and talk about world building. Something that Demon Slayer forgot to do. I mentioned this in my review of Shiki, but vampires are fucking bullshit! In most vampire fiction, they're immortal and it takes 50 villagers with luck on their side to take down a vampire. The vampires can turn other people into vampires and increase their population exponentially, but somehow there aren't that many vampires and normal people don't believe in them. There's an amazing scene in the Witcher novels in which the comic relief bard talks to a vampire about how they reproduce. The vampire replies, ""Of course we can't bite other people and turn them into vampires! Do you comprehend basic math? Let's assume a founding population of just 1,000 vampires that came into existence 500 years ago. Each vampire attacks remote villages and kills only 1 peasant per month. Just 20 percent of those bitten turn into vampires. At the end of the first year, there are just under 2400 vampires assuming a couple fucked up and got killed. At the end of year 5 there are 79,000 vampires. After 500 years, do you really think that vampires would be so rare that you've never seen one?!""
The only way for humans to stand a prayer against vampires would be to design a highly effective weapon that's mass produced to the point that everyone has one and can use it. How about a crossbow that shoots blessed silver bolts? In Demon Slayer, the only thing stopping vampires is the guild of vampire hunters, who designed a test so EXTREME that there are 10-15 vampire hunters at any one time and that's being very generous. In order for the vampires to not overrun Japan, Tanjiro must be putting up INSANE kill numbers. We're talking Soviet state executioner Vasily Blokhin numbers. 7,000 vampires a week! His life is eating, shitting, and killing vampires on an assembly line! In season 2, we're going to be introduced to 3 vampire hunters that by themselves have somehow been running Vampire Treblinka in the middle of Tokyo! Jesus, that rant got dark. I apologize for that highly offensive joke, but I just hate this show so much!
Next, we're introduced to some annoying side characters that add nothing and piss me off. We do get some cool fight scenes though and Tanjiro carries Nezuko around in a basket as an homage to the 1982 B-movie Basket Case. I just wish it had referenced the Toxic Avenger instead. I'm more of Toxie guy!
The art and animation is the only reason this show got a 5 and not a 3 or 4. Demon Slayer followed the My Hero Academia formula to make shonen great again. Rule #1 No filler  #2 Fuck character development. Just have non-stop action! #3 SAKUGA!!! MOAR SAKUGA!!!!
The music was a huge letdown for me. An action scene for me lives or dies by its music. If you want to have non-stop ass kicking, you better have a pulse pounding, AMAZING OST. Demon Slayer got the composer of Idol Master and 1/10th of the Tekken 5 OST. What's wrong with you Ufotable?! You're based out of Japan! You could have hired Michiru Yamane, the goddess who wrote all the awesome Castlevania music over her 30 year career at Konami! She made a whole career out of orgasmic, badass music about beating the fuck out of vampires! Even I would probably give this series a 7 if Yamane had been given the OST. Instead, I'm left having to deliver the sad report that the climactic battle scene from Season 2 of Netflix Castlevania was better than any single scene in Demon Slayer. Yes, the Netflix Americanime with that obnoxious Indian director who said he comes from the future. That show is better than Demon Slayer! Because Bloody Tears!
So in conclusion, if you enjoyed Vampire Slayer...that's cool with me! It just wasn't my cup of tea, but I'm glad other people had fun with it. Those guys on Kitsu sure are overly generous though! If they loved Demon Slayer so much, I can't wait to read the praise they wrote about my favorite anime!

                From the studio that brought you “Fate/Zero” (Ufotable, Inc.), comes another visually stunning ‘eye-gasm’ of epic proportions.  In an age where shoddy 3D animation has run amok, it’s refreshing to see a studio get it ‘right.’  With its unique character designs, fluid action sequences, and gorgeous landscapes.  Weaving a tapestry of eye-gasmic beauty!
Where “Kimetsu no Yaiba” excels in the animation department, it lacks in its unoriginal story and dearth character developments.  While the former shortcoming can be overlooked due to the exhilarating, well executed plot points, the latter cannot.  
Tanjirou Kamado, a trained Demon Hunter set to hunt down the
                  Demon who murdered his family, is a self-insert protagonist who is tediously prosaic.  Thus far, his only known traits is his determination, his protective nature of his younger sister, and his good natured spirit.  These character qualities can be seen in any number of action-oriented shows, and given the unfortunate circumstance of Nezuko Kamado (Tanjirou’s sister), her character will probably be relegated to an ‘unforeseen’ plot twist to stymie Tanjirou in his quest.  A quest that feels somewhat predictable given Tanjirou’s motivations; however, an exciting one, nonetheless.
Despite intermittent moments of silliness and a formulaic plot, “Kimetsu no Yaiba” is an action spectacle that electrifies your senses for 24 minutes of heart-throbbing carnage.",7,Krunchyman

                I don't usually write any reviews for anime, cause it doesn't really matter to me that much to share what I saw, but this time I am making an exception. 
Demon Slayer starts off semi-generic as a story, but is executed well, and that's sort of what I care about. I don't look for the most original things, just any story that is executed well and enjoyable to watch. And at first it's doing a pretty good job. You usually need time to get used to the setting and see if the story itself will start picking up speed as it goes. But around episode
                  10, the whole show gets ruined. To me, it is absolutely ruined, after watching the next episodes and i'll explain why.
Up until that episode, there was just a bit of humour that wasn't great, but whatever, put some to be a bit lighter even though it wasn't required. Then one of the first side characters is introduced - Yushirou, who is the type I quite despise - the type that always has to butt in because he ""loves"" a certain character and needs to assert his annoying behavior over others, because they wanted to show affection towards that character as well. And it's not once, so that we get it - it is every.DAMN.TIME. It just kills the story, kills the pacing and while you have an awesome combat, you have to deal with that crap. But whatever, side character, he'll be gone soon.
But then.........two ""main"" characters appear that pretty much made sure I won't continue watching the show. Because I know they won't change. You have the absolute pantsy Zenitsu and the absolute block-head Inosuke. 
Zenitsu is terrible. He kills the shows. I am not joking. He literally killed the show for me, because all he does is cry, weep, comment in fear on everything that happens and just doesn't shut up. I don't understand how the writer could have written such a poor character - he's not funny. He's just not. He's like Usopp and Sanji combined, but just their most annoying parts. And he goes on, and on, and on - and I know it won't change, because it's shonen. And shonen characters do not change much. This character kills the setting and the mood completely. 
And the other one, Inosuke, is the same caliber of annoyance - only he just keeps screaming how he'll beat the shit out of everyone every. DAMN.TIME. With regards of this character archtype, I feel that maybe Bakugo from MHA is the best example, because at least he has some aura to him and intelligence. Bakugo keeps quiet and doesn't want to deal with the crap of others. But this guy keeps butting in and again kills the setting, which in this show is pretty damn important!! 
So yeah, I had to do this, because I am tired of shows being destroyed by poor written characters and no story can save them, if I have to listen to 10 minutes of a guy screaming and weeping everytime. As far as the main character, he's alright, he might change over the show in some interesting ways, but not those two. Anyone giving this show more than a 7...I don't understand how they can stand for those characters. I know I sound harsh, but I feel like one has to be speak up in cases where you feel how something with a lot of potential can be ruined by something that could have easily been avoided or developed better. As far as the story goes, it really has a lot of potential to grow in areas I can't imagine and that's what makes it really strong.",3,HanAsparux

                HOLY SHRIMP THIS ANIME IS GOOD.
To be completely honest, even though this anime has been doing really well, I still think its under-rated. Let's break down the quality of each aspect of the show shall we? I'll keep this relatively short and summarize the quality of each aspect without spoiling anything!
Story (10/10) : Not only is this anime setting and story line a relatively unique idea, it's also paced masterfully. Some may say the beginning is slightly slow, but if you continue to watch past those parts, it only adds to the experience. It allows you to understand what all those slow paced parts were
                  building up to. The story also has a deep meaning, each encounter, showing the story and reason behind the demon's life and existence. This is one of the few shows which makes me actually pity the villainous race, and at the same time wish for their epic deaths.
Art and Animation (9999/10) : Holy crap is the art and animation NEXT LEVEL. Demon Slayer has a relatively unique style of art, especially compared to modern anime. The art style was taken directly from the manga, and transformed into something beautiful. The CGI in this show is also the best I've seen, not only are the effects top tier, the CGI and frame by frame animation quality is absolutely breath taking. I swear you'll jump out of your seat, screaming ""LET'S F***ING GO TANJIRO"" As he spins a water sword animated with perfection, chopping off the heads of demons.
Sound and Music (10/10) : The sound in this show is the exact model that every single shounen show should have. The effects, ambient sound, all merge seamlessly with the smooth animation. The music effectively hypes you up or change your mood when necessary, AND BOY IS THE MUSIC TRACK AT THE END OF EPISODE 19 SICK, HOLY FU...
Character (10/10) : While reading the manga previous to watching the anime, I really did not like the characters and the character development phases. Each character had a troupe personality, and were relatively cringe to read. Though the anime surprised me, it changed the characters personality into something that was either funny, exciting, or just generally interesting. The character development was outstanding, and at some parts were really emotional and touching.
Enjoyment (9/10) : Although I loved the show, and think it's a masterpiece, I just don't really have a deep connection with it. Sure each week i'd be eager and stay up till 12am to watch the latest episode air, but I just don't have the same attachment to the anime as I do with some of my other favorite shows. That being said, everything was done to perfection in my opinion, and there is just one small aspect which I have overlooked which might've made this show not as good as it can be.
Overall (10/10)
WATCH IT, HOLY CRAP THIS IS THE BEST SHOW THIS SEASON",10,Porukana

                This is going to be a shorter review compared to some other ones that I've written since I didn't write this one in advance as compared to my other two reviews, so this is probably much more disorganized but nevertheless, I wanted to share my opinion on this so far.
Story - 8/10
The story starts off with our main protagonist Tanjiro, who one day finds his entire family killed, with his sister, Nezuko being turned into a demon. Some other stuff happens, which eventually leads to him becoming a part of the Demon Slayer Corps. This immediately establishes a goal, and kind of makes the goal
                  probably somewhat predictable, but I could be wrong since I haven't read the original source material. Some typical shounen tropes happen with one such being a training arc, but to be honest nothing too out of the ordinary. There were some parts that felt boring and felt some stuff was dragged on a bit too long, and there's a time skip as well, but otherwise, it's a pretty solid plot and I'm excited where they'll go with this.
Art and Animation - 9/10
Adapted by the godly people at studio ufotable, I had high expectations on their artwork, and well, they delivered. The animation is crisp, clean, and fight scenes never fail to get me hyped, even if there is sometimes a bit too much talking. One thing that I absolutely love is water effects on Tanjiro's sword, they look so good, and I appreciate the visual style they're taking with this. Background art looks really nice with lots of detail put into it. 3D looks stunning, and I feel like they're one of the only studios that can really capitalize on mixing 2D and 3D animation. The only complaint that I have is that they'll have a 3D model of Tanjiro walking and it looks pretty jarring but other than that, it's great.
Sound - 10/10
The soundtrack was composed by the famous Yuki Kajira and a lesser known producer, Go Shiina, and can I just say that it sounds amazing? Each action scene that they play this soundtrack on I feel like is more memorable than the fight scene itself, yeah it's that amazing. On top of that, you have one of my personal favorite artists, LiSA, and you have a recipe for success. Both the OP and ED were sung by her, and they're also really good. If you have the time, I highly recommend you listen to the OP and ED by itself.
Character - 7/10
Tanjiro is your typical shounen protagonist, optimistic, wants to protect a lot of stuff, which normally would be a complaint, but to be honest, I can't really hate him. Along with that, his special ""trait,"" we'll call it is also pretty unique and its executed in a great manner. Additionally, six episodes in, we're already getting some character development, as more episodes pass on, the stronger he'll eventually get. Nezuko is our other main character that has been introduced so far, and while she doesn't really get any dialogue, she's sometimes just adorable to watch, but other than that, I feel as if she's just kind of there as a plot device, but she does have her moments.
Enjoyment - 9/10
I have been enjoying this anime a lot. From the awesome visual effects to the absolutely amazing soundtrack composed by two talented people, and you have a highly enjoyable time from the beginning of the episode to the end of the episode. I'm only taking off one point because there were some moments that I personally thought were boring, and seeing that it follows a bit of the stereotypical shounen tropes kind of made me roll my eyes a bit. Still very highly enjoyable, even if this might not be for you.",9,fitemeillreku

                Maybe it’s just because I’ve gone old and crotchety, but I’ve been really disappointed with ufotable lately. Maybe even that is too harsh. I’ve just felt so out of touch with them for the past three and a half to four years since they seem to have completely abandoned their old selves. Whether it be the astronomical success of the Fate/Grand Order mobile game, or the fair success of their own Tales of Symphonia OVA BD sales, ufotable has apparently honed in on game adaptations. All they’ve made for TV following their 2014 re-adaptation of Studio Deen’s Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, has
                  been game adaptations. God Eater, Tales of Zestiria the Cross, and Katsugeki/Touken Ranbu, with their only projects outside of TV animation being limited to even more Fate. The ONA series, Today's Menu for the Emiya Family, and the film trilogy, Fate/Stay Night: Heaven’s Feel. It just feels like it’s been so long since I’ve seen them put their phenomenal production values towards something other than a glorified advertisement for some game I have no interest in whatsoever. When I heard they were adapting Demon Slayer last year, I was excited for two reasons. For one, the manga itself had been selling big-time on its own rights and was extremely hyped up, and more importantly, because it was finally something I could latch onto as a real, self-contained, genuine story. However, I naively forgot a story itself has to be good enough to latch onto in the first place, no matter whose adapting it into animation.
If I had to describe Demon Slayer in one word, it would be “expected.” Best seller in Shounen Jump? Okay, well it probably has a really bland main character for all the young boys to project themselves onto. Chapters are released weekly? Okay, well the narrative is probably really slow to give the author time to draw it consistently, with overwhelmingly drawn-out action scenes to keep the kids and teens engaged. Author is new to the industry? Okay, well then I’m sure it sells on stellar art design alone, much like its contemporaries who’s visuals obfuscate their aimless writing and vapid theming. I could keep rattling off my judgmental criticism all day, but the point is, no matter how crude I’m being, I’m not wrong. The main character Tanjiro is, indeed, an uninspired and unopinionated self-insert; the narrative is painfully slow, plodding, and directionless, but not in a way which comes across as intriguing or mysterious at all, just boring; the screenwriting can be frankly incompetent at times, like the time it followed up a scene of the main villain graphically murdering a young girl with a scene of Tanjiro boisterously bickering with a street chef about the unreasonable price of his udon bowls; and while the artwork is extremely unique, well-drawn, beautifully colored, and honestly just pretty to look at, the character writing is brain-numbingly insipid and archetypical. Any assumption you could’ve made about its source material translates identically to the adaptation, and while I mean that for both positive and negative points, the negative is quite pronounced.
However, if the show’s blowout success didn’t make it obvious, the positives are very easy to boast, since the issues with this show—much like the issues with any pop-media bestseller which relies on the patronage of the disproportionally large casual masses—are all hidden under the surface, and while it doesn’t take much thought to peel back the layers and see the emptiness inside, it takes even less thought to just sit back, relax, grab yourself some popcorn, and indulge in the mindless spectacle before your eyes. The action sakuga is outstanding, with the likes of Go Kimura, Masayuki Kunihiro, Mitsuru Obunai, and any other ufotable veteran you can name going all out with their ever-impressive animation extravaganza, and the studio even outsourced some even greater talent in a few godly freelancers like Nozomu Abe to deliver on easily the best cuts of the entire season. And I don’t just mean the best cuts of Demon Slayer’s first season, I mean the best cuts of all concurrently airing anime running alongside it. The artwork is utterly gorgeous and fit with the same sharp, crisply digital, deep color design which ufotable has come to define their aesthetic with, only now with the most unique and attractive character designs and downright badass costume design they may’ve ever had the privilege to work with. Set in a magical take on feudal Japan, everyone wears these beautiful kimonos and yukatas with their own characteristic patchwork designs which take complete advantage of the phenomenal coloration aforementioned, and it all looks wonderful.
Outside of action, the characters are unapologetically switched with CG models in tracking shots, and inside the action, the backgrounds are all 3DCG and frankly fail to copy the camerawork of WIT Studio—which they were obviously attempting to do—but the animation overtop was always bombastic enough to distract its desired casual audience from the cost-cutting, so taking issue with it is pointless. The voice acting was competent, with the exception of Hiro Shimono’s ear piercing performance as Zenitsu which sounds nothing like his best of work, and the sound design was at least existent, which is a hell of a lot more than you can say about most of its genre contemporaries who’ve realized how lazy they can be with their young audiences who couldn’t care less about quality sound design. But speaking of the soundscape, it’s time to stop bitching and start gushing, because I must complement the one person behind the production who outshone everyone else on staff despite said staff already bringing their all, the composer who I’m sure many of you love with all your heart even if you don’t know her name, Yuki Kajiura. If the name doesn’t ring a bell, you still probably know her from her iconic gothic soundtracks for some of the most famous anime of the last decade, from Fate/Zero to Magical Girl Madoka★Magica, and while her work on Demon Slayer was a collaboration with Go Shīna, the combination of his brass with her strings was a match made in heaven. Kajiura was a prodigy to begin with and has only continued as a full fledged musical genius for the past decade, and she and Shīna made this show so much more than it could’ve been, even with its already full staff of talent.
Since Demon Slayer supplants its intellectual emptiness with tireless action sequences, she had more than enough room to work as many high-tempo tracks as she wanted, and they all fit their scenes like a glove. For BGM, she went a direction she hasn’t gone since .hack//Sign (if a little less experimental) and integrated traditional Japanese melodies and chants which complemented the feudal setting magnificently. Shīna has made some solid music before working with Ghost Oracle Drive and their insert songs in God Eater, but the insert songs he pulled off in collaboration with Kajiura are seriously something to behold, because everything I’ve discussed up until this point is all factored back in to the visual spectacle to breathtaking effect. The beautiful artwork is made utterly bewitching by the action wherein the characters’ designs and color aesthetics are artistically incorporated into their fighting styles in the most visually memorable ways imaginable, like Tanjiro’s bright blue scarf flowing off his neck like waves only to be enveloped in the tangible waves flowing out of his blade or his best friend’s striking yellow yukata lighting the entire screen up like fireworks in combat when he himself becomes a raving bolt of lightning. The 3DCG environments are shaky, and the action is what carries this otherwise innocuous show, but I personally found the meandering to sometimes be just as engaging as the show’s biggest and best flair thanks to the god tier hand-drawn background art from the art director who’s work with ufotable was so renowned, Production IG themselves reached out to have him do the backgrounds for Psycho-Pass, the highest budget and most ambitious TV animation production of the 2010s.
But I need to make clear the fact this review sounds overwhelmingly positive only because applying critique to something so vacuous is a brief process. It’s boring, even if someone as seasoned and jaded as myself did manage to find some semblance of entertainment in the experience. I mean, its TV rating was R15, so it gets to be super edgy. There’s this one episode where he fights these two guys underwater and shreds them to pieces like they’re in a blender, so I guess that’s pretty fun. The show got a couple of good laughs out of me, if only for the sheer ridiculousness of the silly gore like that time this guy’s head popped like a ballon when he got hit with this weird CG volleyball. But that’s all the personality I have for you. Tanjiro, the main character, is just another Kaneki Ken, Igarashi Ganta, Midoriya Izuku, Kirito stock standard shounen self-insert. Zenitsu, the token secondary, is just another Uchiha Sasuke, Gray Fullbuster, Kuwabara Kazuma, Yukine stock standard shounen best friend and rival. Inosuke, the guy with the boar mask who literally does the Naruto Run everywhere he goes, is just another Excalibur, Albedo, Darkness, Osamu Dazai stock standard shounen one-note-meme character. Nezuko, the cute imouto waifu with a bamboo gag, is just another Kuroyukihime, Moriyama Shiemi, Elizabeth Liones, Lucy (Nyu) stock standard shounen pet girl. And worst of all, Tomioka, the Dutch uncle whose about as much fun as he looks, is just another All Might, Reigen Arataka, Ichinose Guren, Isshiki Satoshi stock standard shounen superficial senpai. If you liked any of the shows I just referenced, I highly recommend Demon Slayer since it’s the same thing, just much prettier. Not bad, not bad by any stretch of the word, but nothing beneath its eye candy.

                   Ahhh, Demon Slayer. If I were to describe you in very short terms, it would be ""a show with decent to mediocre content overshadowed by its own technical achievement.""
   Firstly, the positives of this show.
   Without a doubt, the main intrigue and appeal of this show upon first inspection is the art, and for good reason. Ufotable, the studio previously mentioned, is responsible for this shows adaptation into anime, and has overall done a fantastic job at keeping a consistent and unique artstyle incorporated throughout the show's airtime. Not only ranging from the shows beautifully rendered backgrounds, cool
                  ass powers, and character designs, but the translation of each element into animation is executed to great measure. Sure, there are admittedly a handful of scenes in which some CGI is incorporated into the foreground, such as character models and moving objects. However, as the show progresses, the use of it altogether is noticeably reduced, and even so, never looks particularly bad when incorporated either, especially considering how awful other shows can look in comparison when attempting this same fate. This is all encompassed and reflective of the fact that Ufotable has seemingly become masters in their craft of aesthetic presentation. The use of gradients, shadows, and contrasts in colors make many scenes, be it moving or standstill, a visual splendor to behold in this show. Previous examples from the same studio such as the Fate franchise and Kara no Kyoukai series impressed me on all levels with their visual presentation, and it doesn't fail to impress me here either. It all has a certain polish to it that I absolutely dig and can't help but worth mention.
   Visual direction, especially amidst action scenes, flow impressively well together. There are a plentiful amount of cool action sequences, ranging from fights with other demons to simple conversation scenes in which we as an audience can get a real feel of our characters' surroundings. Of course, it would be impossible to get away from this review without mentioning the infamous ending of episode 19. Despite the amazingly fitting soundtrack and incredible animation during that final stretch, what pushes it forward is the all impressive visual direction, as we witness a full view and experience of fast-paced movements and a consistent following of our MC flying through the air, swinging at every direction. Speaking about the soundtrack in that scene, the musical score of the entire show couldn't be understated either. Much of the music by Yuki Jajiura and Go Shiina aids to the overall tone of the show. From traditional instruments and vocals to intense orchestras and piano playing, I couldn't be more satisfied with the outcome and overall impression the show's music presents to me. Whether it be in times of a calming relaxed scene, or an actioned packed showdown, the score always seemed to find a way to fit into the mix of it all, enhancing and accompanying the overall atmosphere.
   Well, that essentially wraps up the immediate positives I have to praise about the show. Now onto the mediocre and downright awful aspects.
   Regarding its mediocrity, its stories main idea of fighting against demons after the sudden entire slaughtermen of your family by one isn't particularly special to me and happens to come off as a bit generic, however, nothing much was to be expected there anyways. The protagonist himself, Tanjirou, isn't necessarily that bad, but just underwhelming in terms of depth and personality, as much of it is lost while dedicated and fixed towards another individual, his sister Nezuko, who is admittedly pretty great. The pacing is decent at best, considering events throughout the story flow in such a way that I at least don't feel like I'm being dragged along certain events for too long. However, it is worth mentioning though that the casual time skip implemented, that being of Tanjiros training period, was executed pretty badly, as powers and techniques weren't capitalized on properly, and felt more or less in the end just poorly explained and brushed over. Other than that, the flow of story events was done at a decent speed, with the exception of some scenes.
   Regarding its downright awful aspects, there are a couple of major ones. First and foremost, the comedy. The comedy that makes up this show is genuinely horrible and unfitting and is the biggest offender this show has to offer by far. I'm not sure what the authors intent was of incorporating such childlike and overly annoying immature humor, as I am sure the studio had to translate it one way or another into animation, but it's annoying as hell and I hate it. As I would like to coin it, as incredible as episode 19 was with its action scene, an abomination likewise was met in episode 11 with its introduction of Zenitsu begging a random pedestrian girl to marry him, followed by a rejection. Because of this rejection, what now plagued this show was a continuum of loud, obnoxious, and irritating screaming that ensued throughout the rest of the second half of this series. Secondly, in general, the main supporting cast of characters, that being Zenitsu and Inosuke, are inherently offenders of this show altogether, especially being the main tie in of its comedy. I had actually enjoyed the first half of the show to a decent amount, as there weren't any inherently jarring annoyances and issues that had come up. However, never had I once felt that these characters added anything necessarily positive to the show since their introduction, and instead rubbed off more on me as an annoyance and hindrance to the series than additional entertainment value. They served as failed comedic relief, with some background insight later on Zenitsu in an attempt to develop this already one-dimensional character, but in failure, never gave me any reason to care in the process. The chemistry between the three is unendearing and empty of any real bond. Hell, even the demon lady and boy introduced earlier in the show, with their personal attempts to fit into society and help our main cast with their future endeavors were more interesting and genuine than Inosuke and Zenitsu, but alas they were tossed aside. Thirdly, the whole family aspect never resonated with me, which the show seemed to allude to a lot as well. Callbacks to the family members in times of desperation or despair often occurred, but it always tended to feel like a weak link and a failed attempt of connection with myself as an audience member, since I was never given any experience or personal attachment to this family in the first place.
   Overall, I personally find it hard to call Demon Slayer a genuinely good show. Sure, it can be full of beautiful art and animation, with a great soundtrack and some nice action which I did appreciate and enjoy along the way. However, this is all mainly to praise upon, once again, its technical achievements. Beyond that lies a lack of depth and originality. A disconnect with an audience member such as myself was truly apparent because clearly inhabiting mature fight scenes and story elements amidst a constant regurgitation of 5-year-old humor can paint an unbearable and inconsistent experience for me. Its highs in the show can be pretty high, but in contrast, It's lows can be glaringly low too. It would be a lie for me to say that I hadn't been entertained with the show at certain points in time, however, amongst all of it, it would also be inexcusable for me to disregard the personal annoyances and abundance of issues I had along the way.",5,MainstreamBean

                The anime was pretty lit before the yellow kid and the pigman got introduced.
Their character design is horrible, the constant whining of the yellow kid and the irrational behavior of the pigman is hurting me.  One or two times, fine.  But they just kept doing the same thing every single episodes.  The story also dragged on at the same place for a few episode of useless scenes.
Soft spoilers below

The fact that the yellow dude did almost ABSOLUTELY nothing makes me feel like he shouldn't be in the show, instead, character that looks like they have more potential, for example, the girl at
                  the spider web, having more meaningful lines than the yellow kid is not being introduced as a part of the show.
I wish they don't drag on this for any longer and get them to start doing legit stuffs rather than fooling around with the crybaby",4,Sakura1230

                (SPOILERS:)
 And yes this was taken down but now that i've watched 6 Episodes here is my review: If you want the overall here it is: Demon Slayer doesn't do anything new or ground breaking. The characters feel reused from other Shonens and the plot is like if Full Metal Alchemist and Tokyo Ghoul had a baby but that baby lacked drama, subtleties, or nuisanced characters. If you like Shonens, you'll like this show. It is entertaining but there's not much to it here.
If you're tired of the Shonen genre and hoped this show had even a little more depth to it's characters, world building
                  and how it's presented you'll be disappointed and my review will consists of these faults. 
Some more good (because I'm trying not to be a complete Debbie Downer eh!):
The use of mystery to introduce every monster of the week is entertaining. When Episode 6 began I was getting flashbacks to The Witcher 3 and Claymore and it was genuinely enthralling. Well...it was until it showed how he solves the mystery. Much of it gets boring when Tanjirou constantly says things that are obvious and not needed to be said and it contributes to this anime's over use of narration but at first it was nice. 
There is fun action. If you're watching this show just to watch some sword fights, you're golden.  
Art is nice. Animation is stellar, not much to complain, you may get a few ugly CG moments but it passes quickly.
With that said and BTW SPOILERSSSSSSSS.....lets go
Episode one wasn't good in my opinion as Demon Slayers is one of the most generic animes I’ve seen in a long time. Everything that it does has been done a thousand times and then some in other shows, some even more competent than this one. However I don’t really downscore an anime on the uniqueness of its story because every story has been told before. Without looking at the story what we are left is the presentation and in my opinion, presentation and execution matters more. You can have a beautiful, poignant story filled with love and anguish but if it’s presented sloppily, the plots don’t hold together, or characters don’t feel believable then….who gives a shit. And well, Demon Slayer is presented rather poorly. 
Let’s talk about the good. The art and animation is fairly competent in their style and use of CG. The art direction is genuinely beautiful and subtle. Showering white snow and the faint puffs of warm breathes dissipating from characters really brought to life this fantasy world and it’s themes of the icy cruelty that the world befalls its citizens. Even though we don’t yet see this cruelty aside from the rumors of Demons roaming about, which we don’t even get to see. That’s about the only thing I found good in the first episode. I really wished this subtly was put into EVERYTHING ELSE in the episode. 
The protagonist’s family’s sole purpose is to garner pity from the audience. They show how happy Tanjirou’s family is but this is immediately contradicted with Tanjirou narrating “We still are struggling to survive even though we look like a happy family”. This problem doesn’t just stem from this anime but it’s within the anime industry in general: they have the unfortunate habit of telling and not showing. Without Tanjirou’s narration we would have no idea that they are poor and in dire need of income. Most of them seem fine in terms of health. They all wear rather colorful clothing that’s clean and none are starving or seemingly depressed about their situation. We don’t even see a clear divide between how people look in town compared to his family, how am I supposed to believe that they are struggling to live? I know that the reason why they don’t explore this is so that it’d make the audience feel even sadder when they die because it’s much more dramatic in terms of how the situation has now changed. From “look at us, we’re all one big family “ to “look at how horrible and cruel everyone has been massacred, aren't you sad?!!!”. I know I'm not being subtle here but neither is the anime. This does not do well for the believability of this struggling family and above all this doesn’t make me feel anything for them, as this plot device is very predictable, melodramatic, and done to death. What contributes to family’s lack of believability is their on the nose dialogue. Everyone in this story talks straight out and says everything that’s right on their mind. If they’re not doing that they’re narrating it for us, the audience because the writer (whether it’s the original author or the scriptwriter for the episode) doesn’t understand real human communication. Again, it doesn’t have to be real but because this is a story about people, even if they are exaggerated by anime levels they should be believable. People rarely speak what’s on their minds. We have our own goals, hidden agendas, wishes and so on. Because of that we don’t usually just say things straight out. We euphemise, lie, and avoid the truth to spare others or ourselves. When characters start speaking on the nose, it shows a lack of good characterization and demonstrates how lazy the writer is being. All the characters just start sounding the same. We as an audience like to have a sense of discovery about characters and formulate why a character says something. When it’s said straight out, the audience has nothing to hold on to. In essence, it’s BORING. Anyone could write stock characters like the family members of Tanjirou and Nezuko because there is no real character in them. If you don’t believe me, then tell me what each of their personalities are without resorting to vague cliches? You can’t. The mother is motherly and caring, the siblings are sweet and cute and cheer on their big brother, the slightly older but still younger brother to Tanjirou is sort of rebellious but still loves his big brother. They are all stock characters. Nothing more. So? Even if I am right, how does this negatively impact the story you ask? Well, who really gives a damn that they died? We had no attachment to them as they literally were introduced and killed off screen less than 9 minutes later. WHO CARES. And when the audience doesn’t care about one of the main drives that starts the hero’s journey, you’ve clearly done something wrong. We can’t identify with the motivations of Tanjirou (at least emotionally) and so why should we cheer him on. I’m not expressing that more time spent on characters would necessarily make them more developed although there is something to be said about that however how they are presented and established matters most. You can develop and make characters feel believable in a short amount of time but that takes subtly and showing not telling. For example in Star Wars: A New Hope we are introduced to Luke and his family and their deaths would eventually serve a similar purpose for his hero’s journey. However it’s in how they are portrayed that’s the most important. While Luke’s family wasn’t the most developed characters they were written with much more nuisance and conviction than the family in Demon Slayer. For one thing, Luke’s aunt and uncle do have goals and worries for their nephew that they do not express forwardly to him. They worry about him and if he would grow to be like his father. They care so much for him that they make the excuse that he still has work to do on the farm in order to prevent him from enlisting in the Imperial Academy. As I’ve stated they are not the most developed characters but they are good and do have solid believability for their roles. They don’t play up the “we are a happy family trope” in order to set you up for the tragedy. None of the other Kamado family has this nuisance in them. Nothing for us the audience to grasp onto, because if they did, their loss would be much more tragic. Instead they do the cliche thing in which they play up the happy moments in order to create even more of a dramatic shift when shit hits the fan. It’s lazy. 
Lack of subtlety isn’t just affecting the character writing but the music as well. The score is very on the nose with the emotions it’s trying to get out of you. If it needs you to feel sad, it plays this high strings sad violin. If it’s intense action it’s this pulsing orchestra. Nothing that really stands out but in fact creates a lot of melodrama within the scenes that’s not needed. The scene where Tanjirou discovers all the mutilated bodies of his loved ones could have been much more effective without music at all because if done well we should have already been feeling sad for him. In fact no music would have set this scene apart and would have made it much more memorable because throughout the rest of the show music plays everywhere. However because the of the poor characterization and pacing they have to play up the music for the feeling to come across. It’s not good storytelling when you have to rely on something as a crutch to tell your story. 
Speaking of crutches, the narration is terrible. Narration can be justified and done well such as in Oldboy (2003). Dae-su is captured within the first 10 minutes of the film and as he’s banging on his captor’s door he narrates “If they had told me it was going to be fifteen years, would it have been easier to endure.” What Dae-su says here is justified as throughout the sequence he seems to be losing his mind and contemplating such a thought gives him a false sense of hope, maybe even relief in his situation. We as an audience can participate in this too and even believe the opposite. “Had I’d been in his position and I knew i’d be there 15 years it’d kill me inside”. This narration also serves a purpose in providing exposition that doesn’t feel forced as it’s provided through a conflict in the story. Demon Slayer’s narration is out of control and seems like the only story telling device the author knows how to use. We even get narration from Giyuu who’s introduced in the same episode and starts having this minute long monologue in his head to the audience while he’s fighting Tanjirou. This is problematic for a few reasons. One: we don’t even know Giyuu, he was barely just introduced. WHY ARE WE SWITCHING OUR PERSPECTIVE TO ANOTHER CHARACTER ALREADY WHEN OUR MAIN PROTAGONIST HASN’T YET BEEN ESTABLISHED? Two: why does he care that Nezuko seem human enough to leave alive? This is more of a plot hole but it’s still a valid one. He’s a seasoned, demon hunter he should know how dangerous these things are and by letting Tanjirou have his way he’d be putting more people at risk to Nezuko. He even admitted that most of the time human-turned demons turn on their loved ones in a second’s glance even if they seem docile at first. The reason why he lets Nezuko live isn’t believable for the character that they set him out to be since he’s supposed to be this righteous type that serves the greater good no matter what. It’d make much more sense if maybe he was a crazed morally ambiguous demon hunter who’ve experimented on demons before and grew a fascination toward Nezuko since she seems to have kept some humanity. He let’s her and Tanjirou go because he wishes to see the outcome of their journey or whatever. You may not agree with my version but it’s a stronger reason for him letting them go than just optimism. Three: his monologue becomes a crutch for subtly and nuisance in the character. Maybe we don’t even need a reason why he let them go at first, we can hint at something in his past but not give in to it all the way, like maybe he’s had a similar experience or something but we do this in the moment of when he’s confronting Tanjirou through his interactions NOT INTERNAL MONOLOGUE. Let us see the anguish and horror on his face as he realize that the two survived a family massacre to tell the story and his reluctance to give Tanjirou answers. We can play off his character with these moments and give mystery to him and why he lets them go. This will create tension and internal conflict for his character and promises a character arc for him in the future. Already, by doing this he’d be much more interesting and plot progression won’t feel cheap. 
Episodes 2 and 3 doesn’t do much to alleviate the problems with the show, although they are generally better now that we’re out of the beginning and heading towards the “meat” of the show. These episodes are adequate but they still suffer from that constant expositioning and narration. For no reason Tanjirou and other characters just keep saying things that we already know or can infer. The demon that slaughter the family in episode 2 is a prime example of what I mean. In the episode he clashes with Tanjirou and gets hacked in the throat. He states “Oh I can heal this is no time” and it heals. Why would he say that? It brings me out of the supposed tensed moment more than anything when I have to questioned what was gained from that response. A better way to handle it would be this:
(Tanjirou gazes from his fallen position to the demon before him. Its eyes widen with fear and pain as it clutches for its throat, a gaping crimson slit spitting blood everywhere. For a moment a wave of relief washes over him, believing that he had won the fight. The demon’s lips curl upwards into a sadistic snarl and his eyes fill with amusement. He cackles uncontrollably as he releases the grip on his throat. To Tanjirou’s surprise the wound is gone, only remaining is a faint line that keeps disappearing till it’s no more. The demon meets Tanjirou’s quivering eyes once more before pouncing onto him, with beastial force.)
It works better when you don’t treat your audience like idiots.
The fights lack tension. I don’t find the demons particularly threatening as they don’t really seem all that capable. Aside from a strong healing factor, humans seem like they can handle demons pretty well. Tanjirou is still a teenager but he’s managed to grapple with TWO demons without so much of a scratch. He even head-butts the demon and OF COURSE we get narration from the demon which says “ Urggh! His head is really hard!”. HIS HEAD IS REALLY HARD. He literally says that…..(it reminds me of: ""Ow! Heat was Hot!"" Kudos and cheers if you know the reference ;) )
It hurts the world building when we question the main threat of the whole series. If the author wanted Demons to come off as terrifying beasts he should be very exact in distinguishing the differences in power levels between humans and demons. The line gets pretty blurred in the OP as everyone is unleashing “Bankais” and doing superhuman feats and again later on during training when Makomo says you can become as strong as demons when you just “breathe” a certain way. The anime/manga Claymore does this significantly better by outright stating that humans are nowhere near the level of even a basic Yoma. Killing one would take years of training and understanding Yoma as seen with Raki and even then Yoma still have the added benefit that they are totally undetected by human means, which again puts them at a disadvantage. Even if the first demons they meet are supposed to be “low level” or whatever they should still be a huge threat but the he defeats the Ep 2 demon pretty easily. Later on many of the other Demons he encounter act like third rate Bond villains. They stop their attacks and go on a minute long monologue telling Tanjirou who they are, what they've done, and their plans for eating him. It's silly more than threatening. You remember how menacing Titans were in Attack on Titian? They didn't say or do any of that, it was all in their actions and what they did. Or like in Kabaneri of The Iron Fortress, again the zombies in there were threatening and horrifying without having to go "" Roaarr, roarr, I'm gonna eat cha little boy!"". I'm not saying they should be mute, but they should be scary because they're doing scary things, not telling it. It also doesn’t help that he’s already got one on his side so every time he’s in even a little trouble she can bail him out. (And this is one of her only 2 purposes, the other is to be MOE as FUUUCCK!) 
Also a point that never gets addressed even up to episode 3 is Nezuko. Why does being turned into a Demon apparently make you a mute? I mean she’s human enough not to attack and eat Tanjirou shouldn’t she be able to say something or communicate in some manner if you want to make the argument that the BDSM pole is preventing her? It's not a magic seal or anything, it's literally something Giyuu just shoves in her mouth thinking that she can't just hulk out and rip that thing off. If being turned into a demon makes you a raging animal with no conscious thought then how did that demon in episode 2 talk to him and even seem to have a banter with him? Or any of the other Demons later on. I’m okay with any reason just give us a reason that makes some sense. You’d think that Tanjirou would have tried something, anything, in order to communicate with her as she was the only who survived the massacre. If this is not possible then it’s important that it’s addressed or else it becomes a plot hole. I know it was stated that Nezuko is saving her energy by inducing into a comatose state so she doesn't feed on people but I find this reason faulty and boring in terms of what could have been an alternative exploration into character dynamics of the two. The master says she's inducing this sleep but why hasn't any other demons done this then? I'm sure there have been others who've loved their siblings enough not to want to eat them but I guess their love wasn't as special as Nezuko's love for Tanjirou? I guess other demons didn't love their siblings enough to try this. And this method seems to work flawlessly without any problems because she still saves him whenever the author deems it's necessary and the anime doesn't show any drawbacks aside from her sleeping a lot. It's a bit hard to believe. 
When they showed the bodies of the family that was just murdered I thought Tanjirous was going to do the smart thing and hack pieces off to feed Nezuko, maybe even save some for later. It’s brutal but he loves her and it’d SHOW the lengths he be willing to go for her. But that doesn’t happen. 
The training montage is not good because we are constantly being pulled out of the moment by Tanjirou’s narration. Tanjirou writes in his journal about every single aspect of his training after he has experienced it already and this creates a disconnect with the audience. We can’t experience the training with him because he’s already done in in the past since he’s recalling everything that happened in the past tense. It’s hard to actually see his growth when he just says he’s getting stronger instead of the anime taking the time to show us that. Again we don’t need narration of the things he’s learning and in fact it’d be much more impactful if we were kept in the present with Tanjirou and learning along with him and his master. We’d be able to create a connection with the master as we would be with Tanjirou learning the ways of Demon Slaying with him as it happens. Such as in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back we are in the moment with Luke as he trains with Yoda. Because we are in the present with him and Luke is not taking a step back to narrate for us we build a connection with Yoda. Everyone remembers Yoda despite being introduced and put into only one movie of the original saga. Can you even imagine if Luke had narrated to the audience and said: “ I told Yoda I wouldn’t be able to lift up the X-Wing even if I tried and then he told me: ‘Do or do not, there is no try’.” We see Luke’s failures throughout the training, and these failures are rooted with his character. I don’t really see an internal connection between Tanjirou and his training and how it relates to one another. Sabito later says that he’s not “man enough” but how does that have anything to do with his character? When was Tanjirou’s arc that he’s not “man enough”? Yeah he didn’t “finish” the demon in episode 2 but he didn’t hesitate to slit its throat with an ax. If this was his arc then shouldn’t the proper conclusion to his arc be that he slains a demon all on his own? But instead he has to split a rock in two. I know he kills Morph Demon but that part isn't part of hid training arc. The master even said that his training is complete and that he's accepted to the Final Night now. I understand the reason why the training was so rushed but because of that it lacks believability. Another example is My Hero Academia the first season. I’m not the biggest fan of MHA but it does Deku’s training a whole lot better than Tanjirou’s. Deku is accepted by All Might as an apprentice and a similar training ensues but the difference here is that Deku rarely exposites for the audience, it’s used scarcely and visual changes of Deku is put at the forefront without a lot of narration. We don’t hear Deku saying “ OMG this fridge is so heavy” and “All Might told me I have to be as swift as the ocean so we’re going swimming”. No it's all shown and we can infer it all. The ending of the montage is a climatic pan of Deku, screaming with all his might, bruised and batter, as he stands tall on top a mountain of collected trash, his tone body against the roaring winds. NICE! 
The fight with the Morph Demon was narration galore and it's ridiculous. I'm tired of writing the same thing over again so if you like Shonens you'll be fine with this fight. 
Tanjirou's mercy he shows to it is really inconsistent even within the same episode. If it's in his character to show mercy to Demons then what about the others he killed in the same Episode or the Gloop Tripplet Demons in ep 6 where he gets pissed that they told him they like supple young 16 year old girls. He charges at these with no mercy but the Morph Demon was the one who got the soft attention because he missed his brother? I'm fine if this is part of his character but the way it's portrayed is not believable especially when they try to justify it by trying to make you sympathize with the Morph Demon in a cheap flashback, as if he didn't murder and enjoy the fleshy bodies of little kids...seriously...who really feels bad for him. There's a serious disconnect of emotions when you can't identify with what the Protagonist is doing because it makes no sense and you wouldn't ever see yourself doing that same thing. This angelic mercy he has is a contrived trope that has been already done to death in other animes. Sure the opposite reaction is also a cliche, having raging hatred towards them. However one feels justified while the other feel forced in order to make sure you know Tanjirou is such a good guy.  
I do agree with the Morph Demon on one thing though:
 Yeah, that master literally did send those kids to their deaths...i don't care how ""sorry"" they make him to be, he still did it. I laughed because they even pointed this out with no self awareness. If the Demon Slayers are truly in control of the Final Nights then they should know exactly what's going on. It's a plot hole when they allow the demons to get that strong without any safeguards. You're Demon Slayers right? Aren't you supposed to be protecting kids? That's like if in My Hero Aca, the entrance exams was to fight a whole city filled with unsupervised  super villains, and one in particular had become so powerful he's survived multiple trials for years and if they get killed or whatever it's whatever. Young boys , young girls...whatever right? This actually makes the Demon Slayers Corp outright inept or ruthless with no repercussions. If they're this merciless, shouldn't villager and people outright despise them, why isn't Tanjirou angry at this. His character is that he wants to protect people, SAVE PEOPLE, yet the final nights seem like they're just sending kids to their deaths for no good reason and he doesn't bat his eye? In Full Metal Alchemist Edward is constantly at odds with the State because of shit like this and he's interesting and well fleshed out because of it. Edward seems real, while this seems contrived. 
Also I was right, Nezuko is a Deus ex machina. She's cute and I'll admit her character design is very attractive. SUE ME!  
Overall, Demon Slayer doesn’t do anything new or particularly well. The characters are dull and overused, the story is riddled with plot holes or just contrivances, and the world doesn’t feel very well- fleshed out. At the heart of all the problems with Demon Slayer is it’s lack of subtlety and overuse of “telling rather than showing” to convey it's story. Like I said if you like Shonen, this anime will be just right for you. For anyone else, it's a flashy trip that unlike the devoured children in the show, lacks any meat or substance.",5,Val3n

                I’ve been obsessed with Japanese anime for more than 20 years. I’m such an otaku that I’ve watched (or heard of) almost every anime out there. But never have I been as moved or awed by any anime, as I have by Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. I rarely write reviews, but I’m making an exception here because this anime is just too remarkable.
Watching this anime, from Ep 1, has been an exceedingly emotional journey. The combination of flawless animation, gorgeous music and magnificent storytelling puts Kimetsu no Yaiba right at the top.
Have I mentioned the animation? Have I? It’s bloody fantastic, pun intended. Obviously,
                  with better technology, there has been an increase in the number of stylistically beautiful anime over the years (e.g. Violet Evergarden, Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works etc). But frankly, I think this anime surpasses them in the way it highlights movement and how it melds different angles and perspectives. The animation style used is so unique. I love the combination of the bright and (sometimes) garish comic book-like effects in the foreground and the more typical and subtle soft landscapes. It’s stylistically brilliant and an absolute joy to watch.
Let’s talk about the audio effects. In most anime, music is used as an accent to the animation. Excellent song-writing is prevalent and memorable. That’s why we have iconic theme songs and instrumentals (think Studio Ghibli). However, what makes this anime stand out, is the way the audio pairs with the animation. Beautiful music aside, I can no longer imagine the animation without the audio effects. They can’t be separated; such is the perfection and appropriateness of the use of sound.
Finally, storytelling. Let me clarify. The story itself (primarily about family, love and perseverance), isn't particularly fresh or new. However, it's how the story is told that makes it so very compelling. I’m not going to give any spoilers, but the writer has done everything right. Unless your heart is made of stone in the manner of Dr Stone, your heartstrings will be wrung. I’m usually very critical of storytelling and character development but this anime has done those so well that my expectations soar with each episode. And every week, I continue to be impressed and delighted. Especially today’s Ep 19. Gosh. What a revelation. What an experience. Truly. 
Also, having watched countless anime, I’m rarely surprised by most story developments. The way this story is written is so incredibly creative that I literally can’t predict anything. I mean, it's a fantasy anime, so there's a lot of room for creativity. However, what I think this anime has done best, is how it makes you feel about the characters. Many might have realised it, but I think how we (the audience) feel about the characters (demons included) mirrors how Tanjiro feels about them. As it goes along, the anime introduces characters and we're left wondering who they are, why they behave a certain way. With more information, our bond with these characters grow as well. Certain behaviourisms (those who have watched more recent episodes will totally get this) start making sense and it endears these characters to us. And of course, I think Tanjiro is a decent main character because he somehow always successfully makes me root for him. He's driven by a very clear purpose and the decisions he makes stem from that. I love his empathy; it's an ideal and frankly, quite refreshing because it allows us to see things from different perspectives. The writer somehow managed to do all that, all the while maintaining a logical and cohesive storyline. This, is what I call top-notch storytelling. 
The anime hasn’t even ended, but I can truthfully say that I’m positive that this is going to maintain its place as my favourite anime of all time. If you want to experience the very best of Japanese animation, look no further. This is the anime to go for. You won’t regret it.",10,snufflesbear

                Once upon a time, the anime industry came up with the perfect formula to create highly acclaimed shounen one after the other; however, as time passed, this pattern became repetitive and, while a few next-gen shounen have been able to achieve their objective following this predetermined path, most of them have faltered along the way.
Kimetsu no Yaiba is not your typical shonen anime but at the same time it is. It does not have your archetypical main character that accomplishes all his goals through the power of friendship and/or by activating his hidden power -which is never revealed until the plot armour established is not
                  life-saving enough-; instead, Tanjirou is a run-of-the-mill guy who does not become a one-of-a-kind swordsman overnight, but spends months training, shedding his blood, sweat, and tears, showing the story of struggle and how it has molded his character.
It does not attempt to build a story based on a main protagonist who wants to become stronger justified by the simple fact of being the strongest or proving the world wrong, but for a much deeper motive.
It’s also not afraid to deviate from the standard path taken by most shonen of advancing as little as possible in each episode, mainly done to extend the journey –and the money raised- as much as possible. Speaking about this, Kimetsu no Yaiba solid pacing makes the show advance energetically, although it does not forget to catch some breath when the situation justifies it –as in ep. 19, if you know what I mean…-.
Still, it follows the standard battle shonen familiar-hero’s journey plot of: member(s) of family killed fuels progress, finds someone who trains/instructs him, passes an exam to become part of a faction, and, after becoming strong enough, ends up in an expedition where he makes friends and forges bonds, while at the same time encounters people (either comrades or villains) that change his way of thinking and acting towards life. However, if it’s done correctly, who says this is a bad thing? 
As you can see, the plot is rather simple and straightforward, as nothing really stands out story wise speaking, though it doesn’t change the fact that the show is remarkably enjoyable. Despite a pretty slow start where some parts felt quite boring, the story came up to be really attention-grabbing, and these first episodes turned to be important for establishing a solid, well-paced plot -so please wait a little bit for the action! -. Also, the power progression pace is nicely done too, making it quite satisfying to watch them apply their training to the battles. Besides, the way different situations are expressed through narration is pretty noteworthy, transforming this shounen-type anime into a really good piece of story exposition.
Ufotable is just flexing on other studios right know. Digital era has given studios the opportunity to develop in so many different ways, though Ufotable has seized the opportunity to improve as much as or more than anybody else, and Kimetsu no Yaiba represents a good case in point.
With a unique art style, they’ve achieved to display an outstanding hack-and-slash action-packed animation really eye-catching to the viewer. That’s mainly thanks to a really fluid and lifelike animation, which pays close attention to even “minor details” such as rendering, moving backgrounds or characters’ portrayal. I mean, who would not love to see humans slashing demons, demons crushing humans, in short, both fighting against each other in a life-and-death struggle with flashy action sequences full of intense colouring, smooth shading and outrageous use of angles that enhances the experience?
Additionally, the way which music and voice acting has been used on this 1st season has been amazing. Without going into comparing its OST to that of other shows, we could say that it’s a soundtrack that it neither will remember for the ages nor would get stuck in replay on your mind for weeks, although when watching the show it’s pretty noticeable and makes a lot of scenes much more enjoyable and mesmerizing, making it pretty obvious that both the piece itself and the moments chosen for the OST to be played were extremely well thought-out.
Last but not least, characters. Some think Zenitsu is irritating; some think he’s hilarious. Some think Tanjirou is a light-hearted, kind, strong person; some think he’s too trustful. BUT WHO THINKS THAT NEZUKO IS NOT WORTHY OF WORSHIPING? NONE. Jokes apart, characters play an important role in KnY, as they carry the whole series in a team effort, meaning that most of the characters with some screen-time are important, as they play a part in the development of the story and/or our protagonists; they do this quite well, making most of them really likeable and relatable –even though we are talking about demons and swordsman- as, their feelings, goals and states of mind are much like our own, as well as their abilities –speaking exclusively about the human union-, which are obtained via loads of effort, and not magically.
However, all is not yet rosy either, as there are diverse subjects, mainly with regard to the story –and I won’t talk too much about it in order to avoid spoilers-, where I sensed -at times- hurriedness and lack of strategic and operational thinking, like in the sequence of different events or with CGI’s utilization. And we can’t forget about that really slow start… 
Nevertheless, all these “complaints” are something minor and end up being ostracised by all the positive points of the series, making it impossible to deny that this anime is one of a kind.",7,lt_wassile

 Welcome to my review of Kimetsu no Yaiba!! Minor spoiler warning!! 
The Kamado family lives happily in peace in their seclude cabin high up in the snowy mountains .After the main protagonist Tanjirous father passing away some time ago, he have taken over he's responsibility and providing for he's family .One day after selling some coal in the village nearby and coming home later than expected, he stubble through the door and are met by a gruesome and horrifying sight!! He's family have been brutally slaughtered .Hes
                  mother and siblings are laying dead in-front of hes feet,but in this tragedy life still existing and breathing, hes beloved sister Nezuko have survived the macabre attack.But as a cruel and terrible twist of fate she is now a demon herself and hunger for humans flesh to devour!! Tanjirou refuse to give up and swear to avenges the death of hes family!!! But mostly to restore humanity back to hes sister!!!!
The story itself especially early in, may feel extremely simplistic uninspired and boring .Village boy get family or village killed and sets out for seeking revenge.Never heard that one before. But with some good twist drama segment and fast even pacing,Combined with some interesting female characters and great side story's it have some interesting factors as well. And the way it being told is pretty entertaining rather than feeling slow and tedious .Its noting special but it works overall   
The animations are just stunning from time to time.The action flows like the mighty river and are a grand spectacle to watch .This anime have gorgeous flashy action scenes with great lightning effect  that are really enjoyable to watch, and makes me looking forward to the next fight!! 
Sadly I think the design on the males in this anime got little attention, and is very dull plain and noting to remember it by.But the demons and females on the other hand have great attention both in details and design, that defiantly are memorable and made a great impacted
When it come to characters this anime total fails again with the males . They are as interesting and deep as a kiddie pool!! The main trios are the most uninspired stereotypical predictable and boring set of reused anime characters i have ever seen . Tanjirou is overly good and wants to help, Inosuke wants to be strong and like to fight, and the last one Zenitsu wants to cry and are afraid of fighting or getting seriously injured.But for some odd reason he joins a society that are in war with the demons!!!,, Doesn't that make sense?,,NO it doesn't!. There are no complexity no deeps to be found .Alone they are horribly and boring enough but together they are a irritating deadly force of chaos!! That destroys everything I like in this anime  .It's like a five-year old was in charge over those so-called humour segments.All they do is run around screaming ans chasing etch other like five years old do. I'm sry but I don't find that very funny! More irritating and infuriating, Biggest problem is the character Zenitsu non stop whining and crying .Complaining seems to be that characters main trait, As soon he is in picture the crying and bitching starts and never stops!! And with a very high-pitched  voice which gives me a headache!!  Don't you just love the things in life that give you a headache? I don't!!!! I want to kill it with fucking fire!!!!!
Again the females come to the rescue!!! They are lifting this anime up and opposite from the male, The female characters are interesting and don't act like misbehaving children all the time .They are beautiful and very alluring. Main character is a little interesting conundrum and I thirst for more information about her.The butterfly girls that get introduce later in is also a huge plus for the story. And with all the good females characters, at-least some enjoyment are to be found in this mess!!
My experience in the whole was extremely inconsistent .The action was incredible and i love every second of it.But the male trio especially the cry baby make some scene unbearable and they are mains so they get a huge amount of screen time,,Running screaming in your face or crying!! In the end its hard to judge. I hate it! I love it! I hate it! I love it! So I give it 5/10 
This anime is trash but its kind of shiny and flashy trash that are nice and fun to look at. When it doesn't piss you off with its poorly written humour or infuriating characters
I dedicate this review to every female in Kimetsu no Yaiba, Thank you for making this anime at-least acceptable",5,Yuri-Crusader

                In life sometimes you get bored of the hobbies you used to have as a child. Anime is one of them in my case. After being disappointed season after season with countless fast food adaptations. I decided to put a stop at my once favorite hobby.
Of course after a short 2 year hiatus you cant possibly ignore that even in that time frame at least something decent had to come out. Generally speaking most popular anime could be considered decent if only viewed on a surface level, but you're in for a surprise. 
Naturally after having thoughts of going back to watching anime. I decided
                  to check what was fairly popular these last months. Spotting Demon Slayer want difficult at all, since it had such an bulked up mean score here in MAL making it into the top 20 ranked anime in this page, So of course I was interested. 
Overwhelmed in excitement and interest I went onto crunchyroll, paid a monthly subscription, and without any doubts I dived right into this series.  (6PM)
After 12 hours of binge watching anime like in my old days, having completed Demon Slayer, with tired eyes, weak calves (after only having snacks for half a day) I turned off my pc, got off my chair and opened up the windows, After letting the air get in my living room I went ahead and prepared myself a meal. 
After 2 hours of reflecting on what i just watched, I could only find myself with nothing but sheer disappointment and deep regret. Feeling the same way just like 2 years ago. Reminiscing on why I even went on hiatus in the first place. 
Such a generic and mediocre title. with nothing new to offer is seriously being tossed around with amazing titles like Berserk and HxH? Is this the standard for an 8 and 9 nowadays? Generic writing and mediocre plot points? The soundtrack is mediocre at best, the animation is subpar, characters are so generic and forgettable.

                It's the heart that drives people. So grow yours to as strong as it can be. That's beautiful, sums up to me what the message of Kimetsu no Yaiba Demon Slayer really is. Follow your heart, listen to it, if your heart is strong you can do anything. The story of Tanjiro and Nezuko is a tragedy there is no doubt but it never feels hopeless. Even at his lowest Tanjiro never gives up, as cliche as that sounds it matters to hear. Some famous words of ""Don't give up, don't ever give up"". Tanjiro and his heart are the embodiment of that ideal. Striving
                  to find a way to cure Nezuko, defeat Muzan, and never stopping along the way. Pushing forward even when your body breaks, even when your soul is crushed. Keeping your heart strong.
Kimetsu doesn't break the mold in any significant way but it handles those old shonen archetypes pretty damn well. Tanjiro could've easily been a run of the mill angry protagonists who wants to kill all the enemies, demons in this case. He doesn't to that though. Just as Shinobu said in the finale, he has a clear goal. The top, the big dog not these little pups. If they're hurting people of course they're to be stopped but the number one goal will never change, these are just stepping stones. Nezuko being his driving force when he's even lower than low. When Tanjiro even for a second thighs of stopping there's always Nezuko he has to look upon and fight for. Whom herself can handle a brawl pretty well. Always a joy seeing the Kamado siblings team up in battle.
The supporting cast is one of my favorite in shonen. Zenitsu and Inosuke alone would make for great lead characters in their own stories. Complementary to Tanjiro and Nezuko they add great foils and instruments of change for the Kamados. Whilst having their own great character arcs in the middle of all this. Zenitsu going from whining about the littlest to even now being pretty resolute in his decision to go on the train mission, no dragging him or anything. Inosuke a bit more subtle development but he's definitely domesticated somewhat from when we first meet him at the Drum House. Learning to work with others to accomplish something greater instead of just fighting them.
All of this to not even dive into Giyu the best big bro around putting his life on the line for these kids, Shinobu the butterfly queen of grace helping them along in getting stronger, Urokudaki getting the Kamados started on this path, Tamayo showing there's a way to break Muzans curse. So many people helping out crew along their journey. It's an endearing and exciting cast to say the least. Ever along we go with bounds of more amazing moments for so many of them.
Visually I don't think there's anything I could say that hasn't been said already. Best looking show of the year in my eyes. Hinokami is the cherry on top with all the incredibly stunning moments brought to the screen. Ufotable has outdone themselves. Truly a marvel in animation, it's ridiculous to think a tv anime could look this good. Nearly movie level quality throughout the show amped up in its fights. My one and only real complaint I'd have is the pacing. Could've been faster but honestly it's not a big deal. Gave us a bunch of intense cliffhangers to gasp at as well as I'm sure giving ufotable the ample prep for all the big scenes. 
Demon Slayer has I think always been good but I think sometimes it takes seeing a story brought to life for you to really appreciate it. That's what happened with me here. The anime has made me savor the manga that much more, especially with it reaching it's end soon. What was adapted here isn't even the best the series has to offer is the crazy thing. There's so much more so see and experience. Loved this anime to the moon and back. A fantastic experience to participate in these past twenty six weeks. Ufotable is a blessing onto us all.

                Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is a Japanese dark fantasy, adventure manga series by Koyoharu Gotōge with an anime adaptation by Ufotable, directed by Haruo Sotozaki and produced by Hikaru Kondo. Season 1 began airing on April 6th, 2019 with the final episode of the season airing on September 28th, 2019.
Here’s the basic plot:
Our protagonist is Tanjirou Kamado (Voiced by Natsuki Hanae). Following his father’s death, Tanjirou supports his family by selling charcoal. Despite their hardships, his family lives a content, happy life. That is, until demons attack and slaughter his family, save for his sister, Nezuko (Voiced by Akari Kitō). It’s not as simple
                  as two siblings surviving a demon attack though, Nezuko has been turned into a demon, but she still retains some human thought and emotion – enough to keep from killing and eating other humans, at least. With no other options left, Tanjiro becomes a Demon Slayer in hopes to turn his sister human again and avenge his family.
Now some detail:
Over the course of their adventure, Tanjirou, of course, gets stronger and learns new skills, in particular he greatly advances his Water Breathing techniques, to use against the demons they face along the way. Nezuko sees a lot of development as well, she does become a bit more human-like, but is ultimately still a demon and must fight her urges to kill and devour, and she learns she is a unique case for a human turned demon, having special abilities such as “Blood Demon Art” (cool demon attacks) and she can sustain herself without eating humans.
Throughout the series they meet other Demon Slayers, such as Zenitsu Agatsuma (Voiced by Hiro Shimono) who has the Thunder Breathing ability, and Inosuke Hashibira (Voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka) who was raised by a wild boar and has the self-taught Beast Breathing ability. It’s great to make new friends and all, but Tanjirou’s sights only focus further when he discovers the identity of the power demon who is responsible for the creation of almost every demon that exists – including Nezuko – Muzan Kibutsuji (Voiced by Toshihiko Seki). Not only is he incredibly powerful, but he commands a force of twelve demons known as the Twelve Kizuki (“Twelve Demon Moons”), whom Tanjirou and the other Demon Slayers must defeat first if they want to even have a chance against Muzan.
Tanjirou is a great character. He is incredibly kind, but that isn’t to say he’s weak by any means. Seeing this world through his eyes is what makes the series stand out among other “demon fighting” troupes. Yes, these demons murder and kill people, but 90% of the time they didn’t become a demon as a choice. They didn’t WANT to become demons – they were either tricked by Muzan or turned against their will and Tanjirou is able to sense their deep despair at what they’ve become, allowing us to see what happened in their past that led them to their transformation. Honestly, it’s usually SUPER sad. There are also other cases like Nezuko, demons who fight the urge to kill – such as Dr. Tamayo (Voiced by Maaya Sakamoto, a talented doctor who was converted into a demon by Muzan, which caused her to kill and eat her entire family. She eventually found a way to alter her cells to allow her to survive on a small amount of blood and no flesh and is working to find a cure for demons.
There are demons who are straight up horrible, but often times you find yourself feeling sympathy for them, the way Tanjirou feels and the other slayers have a hard time comprehending. Rather than kill them to destroy them, Tanjirou kills them to free them from an endless suffering on themselves and others. It a show full of action, but also one that strikes you on an unexpected emotional level.

                Damn, I really loved this anime adaptation. I had read the manga before, and this anime really did it justice.
Story (10): The story is simple, yet so beautiful and entertaining, I must say that when I first read the manga, I felt bored in the beginning. But as the story continued, things just became more and more interesting. What really saved the plot was the characters driving it forward, and the very interesting backstories of the demons. All the backstories really made you feel for all the characters and make you want them to succeed.
Art (10): The art was truly beautiful, and colorful. After having
                  read the manga, I didn't expect the art to be this good. But the world in color was really beautiful. I could rewatch this over and over just because of how beautiful everything looks.
Character (10): Every character served its purpose, and succeeded at it. Tanjiro is an amazing protagonist. He's kind and has his own, unique and beautiful mindset, which is interesting when you put it beside others. Nezuko, while she doesn't speak much as she's a demon, protects her brother as he's done for her, and helps them fight against demons. Her very existence is also proof that demons and humans can live together. Zenitsu is a funny character, but is also relatable as he shows how most people would react in these situations. Not all swordsmen have a lot of bravery. Inosuke is a funny character as well, but is also interesting through his determination. All of the villains are very interesting characters as well, including the mysterious Muzan. And them meeting the Hashiras was a blast as well.
Enjoyment (10): Every episode was enjoyable, interesting and entertaining. I could rewatch this many times and never feel bored. I just love all of the characters, and I also want to know more about what will happen next. Every episode had a cliffhanger as well, making you eager to watch the next episode.
Overall (10): Overall, the Demon Slayer anime was amazing. It's now one of my favorites. I would recommend it to people who've just started watching anime, just as well as those who've been watching anime for a long time. I'm sure that most people will like Demon Slayer as much as me, and the popularity for the anime really makes it justice. The only thing I'm sad about is that I didn't watch the show sooner.",10,ciaovatos

                Never thought that I would ever write review of any anime or manga...
But I am surprised how low can be people's taste.
I was happy when I see 9 score, I thought I got chance to watch masterpiece and thats was total disappointment, bullshit.
Maybe I would give 8 or 9 score to Demon Slayer when I discovered anime for the first time, when I didnt see any bloodshed before and it was absolutely new world for me... I dont believe that any Veteran anime lovers will give that anime more than 6 or 7 points.
hmm... mal asks me to write longer review, so 
Story is most
                  likely good, buy story telling is total bullshit, you always know what happens, for example evil says ""heh I am so strong his katana wont manage to cut me"" and you know that that evil will die by that strike in next second, also too much talking, too unnatural expression, I want to vomit when I watch it, so why I still watch? because 9 score got me, I was like ""hey maybe in next episode something amazing will happen, otherwise how that anime could get 9 score? it must amazing"". thats how I watched maybe 8 episdes, but I am not going to watch Demon slayer anymore, I mean I finished all animes which I ever started, even when I disliked them I always finished. and yet I cant bring myself to finish watching Demon Slayer, total waste of time, and its shame how it is on 18th place. total shame",4,shavlego

                Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is a historical, action-shōnen, supernatural manga written and illustrated by Gotouge Koyoharu. Adapted into an anime series by the immensely talented Studio Ufotable. The studio behind the successful anime adaptions of Type Moon's series: Fate and Kara no Kyoukai.
Demon Slayer has taken the world by storm, the series has exploded in popularity, with manga sales exceeding 100+ million within a year's time. While the anime is being recognized as a classic.
Set within the Taishō period of Japan, young Kamado Tanjiro inspires to become a ""Demon Slayer"", pursuing a path of vengeance for the murder of his family committed by a
                  demon, while also trying to find a cure for his younger sister Nezuko, who turned into a demon.
If you hate shōnen troupes and shōnen anime in general, this series won't really change your opinion. But if you look past that you will find an anime with a simple, but wonderful story, great episode direction, some of the best animation you will ever see, and some of the best voice acting and music.
Ufotable’s adaption is the best anime adaption I have ever seen. An adaption few authors could ever hope to receive. An adaption that is not only better than its source material, but it also enhances the experience in a multitude of layers, ways the manga was never able to achieve. The manga still has a solid story, but suffers from less than impressive artwork, direction, and page layout. While the adaption improves upon the content of the manga while enhancing every other quality.
At its core, it is a battle shōnen. The fights featured are wonderfully animated, superbly directed, fluid, and contain an appealing art style fitting the series. The strength of the fights lay behind the main antagonists, the demons. They are simply monsters that go out of their way to kill a multitude of people, to feast on their flesh while having no remorse or humanity.
Or so that is how you are supposed to view them. But demons were all originally human, turned demon against their wills, suffering from painful hunger, turning violent with their humanity fading away, being portrayed as misfortunate people.
Tanjiro is a very standard shōnen protagonist, he's the hard-working type, has an unusual great sense of smell, and has a variety of comedic quirks. The main aspect of his character is his incredibly kind nature, despite this, he shows no mercy towards demons, and makes no exceptions to beheading one. He essentially kills them in order to ""save"" them, as funny as it sounds.
The Demons he cuts down reveal details about their past lives, eventually coming to regret what they became. While Tanjiro can never forgive their actions of killing innocent people, he still shows sympathy and sends them off to rest. Generally, to deliver this type of message, you would need an overly kind character like Tanjiro, as not many characters could reasonably show sympathy to a cannibalistic monster. While his character is very cliche it is perfect for the series.
Tanjiro an immensely strong bond with his younger sister Nezuko. One of the themes pushed by Demon Slayer is family, their relationship feels genuine and sweet throughout the anime.
The other characters have room to grow, but seeing as only 1/4th of the source material has been adapted, there is still plenty of growth to come. They have their share of quirky personalities and great designs, while each having an appropriate amount of screen time. I am excited to see how they progress, as well as other minor characters.
Demon Slayer has been one of the most enjoyable anime I have watched in a while, for what it is, it's amazing. Such a perfect blend of great animation of music, with a wonderful story that tackles its themes with flawless execution. While certainly not a perfect series, for the time being, I giving Demon Slayer a 10/10.",10,BropixWuff

                Demon Slayer is a Japanese manga series, which was published by Koyoharu Gotouge, which is his 2nd work. An anime television series adaptation by Ufotable premiered on April 6, 2019. The final episode aired on September 28, 2019.
From the earliest times, the humanity knows about human-flesh eating monsters, lurking in the darkness to devour an unfortunate soul that does not trust rumors. However, the rumors also mention an elite corps of demon hunters, skilled assassins, killing demons. Demon Slayer focuses on Tanjirou Kamado, who is still very young, but is the only man in his family. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the
                  local village to make a little money, selling charcoal. When he returns back, he becomes an unwilling part of these horrifying rumors: his family is slaughtered and the only survivor, his sister Nezuko, is turned into demon. For some reason, Nezuko still acts as a human, which is the reason for Tanjirou to join demon slayers and cure his sister. Will he manage to join the elite corps and cure his sister?
It is, without a doubt, quite a challenge to make an interesting and new battle shounen. With so many titles that represent the genre, as well as cliché surrounding it, Kimetsu no Yaiba could have been another title, everyone will stop to hype about after the first week. However, there is something different about it, which makes it stand out. The story-line is slow, which grants enough development, the main protagonist does look like your average battle-shounen protagonist, but he is not as annoying as his counterparts, characters are actually interesting, since even supporting cast receives enough development, finally, the setting looks somewhat new, because you will not see that often a setting, describing the Taishou era.
Animation wise, it is quite challenging to find even one work of ufotable with bad animation. It does look somewhat similar to Katanagatari, but not quite. Everything from character designs to action scenes looks just awesome and beautiful, an eye candy you want to never end. Sound wise, even if there is English dub one day, I would still highly recommend you to watch Demon Slayer subbed, because of many voice acting gurus, voicing this series. Even the OST fits the anime well and makes the series even more catchy.
Characters is another important part, a must to make battle-shounen likeable. Kamado Tanjirou, however, does not look that promising to 'carry' the whole series. However, this problem is solved when he is joined by the other protagonists of the series, who together form a very likeable group of protagonist. They are interesting, because of how different they are: Tanjirou Kamado is a very trustworthy and hardworking individual, but he is a too trustful. Nezuko Kamado, Tanjirou's sister and the only person that was able to remain human after having been turned into a demon. The noodle head Zenitsu Agatsuma is a member of the Demon Killing Corps and a traveling companion of Kamado Tanjirou. He is always scared by any noise, but he becomes a fearful enemy for the demons, when it is needed. Inosuke Hashibira is the last companion of Tanjurou and he is also a t..p.
Enjoyment wise, it is truly one of the brightest gems of this season. Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of these titles that was able to unite comedy and drama and make it interesting to watch. What I mean is that many series were trying to do that, but failed. One was intervening with the other and the end result was horrible. Here, however, just like in Gintama, it is both funny and dramatic sometimes, which makes it that good. Imagine 26 episodes of nothing but drama. This is just unreal for any person.
Overall, Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of a very small amount of battle-shounen series that is actually fun to watch. The story, the art, the voice acting, the OST, I cannot think of anything, I did not like about it, nor have I ever felt bored, when I was watching this series. There are, however, some minor flaws, I feel useless to even mention. Great job, Gotouge Koyoharu. For your first animated series, Demon Slayer is quite an achievement to be proud of.

                I rarely like shounen protagonists. They're usually ""dumb"", noisy, self-centered, ambitious, somehow inapt, don't seem to know how to deal with feelings... which is boring to me. Tanjiro's different.  He's sweet, caring, and is not after some big thing for himself. He reminds me a bit of Kenshin, from Rurouni Kenshin. And it's not only him! Other characters in Demon Slayer have been/are being developed this wayl: Urokodaki, the leader of the Demon Slayers, Tomioka in his own way... To me this is a plus. I love to see male and female characters go out of their traditional roles, because this way I can
                  actually identify with them.
The contemplative moments are just incledible, imo. You know, the pauses where we can actually breath after the action and enjoy the amazing scenery. Ghibli movies do it beautifully and I Think Demon Slayer does it too. And I love the moments where we are in Tanjiro's mind.
Which brings me to the one thing which I think is a REALLY put-off: Zenitsu and Inosuke. They are SO noisy and repetitive. All that peace and contemplation goes away when they appear. But they're having their share of development, so I really hope it gets better with time.
Outstanding animation and sound, I don't think I even have to comment on that. Top-tier. Nice gory/horror moments.  Tanjiro definitely does not flinch before taking a demon's head or makes a fuss because of his compassion. The characters actually get injuried to the point that they can't fight. Those things add up to Incledible high-stakes battles.
To me, the words for the script/dialogues seem hand-picked, because it's neither excessive nor lacking: just perfect for the moments in question and what they want to achieve (exceptions are Zenitsu and Inosuke, of course). And there are moments where no words are needed. For example, the anime doesn't keep stating how great the main character is - It shows you, in beautiful ways.
The plot is simple and easy to follow. I'm the one to like complicated plot lines, but I was surprised to see how a simple but well done development can get you so involved. No good animation that can compensate shallow characters and poor development, I've seen this time and time, because you and up asking yourself in the middle of it: seriously? all this prodution for this? Demon Slayer is not like that. It's getting a lot of hate because of the ""overhype"". Is it the GOAT shonen? NO, IT'S NOT. But it's great, and I think we have to do it justice.
To me, the keyword to define Demon Slayer is ""involving"". It's that thing that the sum is bigger than its parts. It's dark, beautiful, simple, well made, with relatable character and key moments that get you seriously hooked. To me it's enjoable through and through.",9,vkmlia

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is definitely one of the most popular titles to be released in the anime industry in the recent years, especially due to its beautiful animations and visuals. However, just like with every anime, such popularity also comes with high expectations from viewers who pick up the anime based on this fact - they expect to see an anime that is near perfection in all of its aspects and one could never raise a finger about any of the discrepancies. 
What I'm referring to is the amount of unnecessary hate Kimetsu no Yaiba has received for having seemingly lackluster story and/or bad writing.
                  While this might be the case when we're looking at some of the more popular titles that focus on mystery or storytelling, like Steins;Gate, people seem to forget that Kimetsu no Yaiba never had its focus set on one of these concepts. Instead, the anime markets itself as a shounen anime, and as someone who has watched a dozen of titles in the same genre, I can say that in comparison it is vastly superior.
What I can personally say about the story is that while it might not be the most revolutionizing story you might find in the market, simplicity is NOT the same as bad writing. Instead, I think this is one of the charms that Kimetsu no Yaiba has: A story of a boy whose family was murdered while he was away, and his sister gets turned into a demon. However, his sister still seems to have some humanity left in her and so the boy strives to become a demon slayer to cure his sister. That is basically the entire story summarized, and while it might not look like much, it sets a strong foundation with a clear goal that just about anyone is capable of following. Additionally, in comparison to the usual shounen anime, the anime doesn't rely on keeping its viewers entertained with fanservice or surrounding the main protagonist with chicks, but with the sole anticipation of seeing him grow as a warrior.
It might be debatable whether the anime could've included something more to make the anime stand out as something particularly unique, but keeping up a staple in the genre keeps the anime consistent and doesn't leave much risk in making the story too messy. After seeing a few titles go too far and basically ruin themselves in the process, I am relieved that Kimetsu no Yaiba has decided to stand on its own roots.
However, that doesn't mean that the anime doesn't have a couple misconceptions, which is the reason why I refrained to give this anime a full 10. While my standards for giving a 10 are quite high, it is also a fact that even Kimetsu no Yaiba falls into some of the usual mistakes that shounen anime tend to make. While this might be to linearize storytelling and keep the juicy action going, there was a couple things I would've liked to see being promoted a little more to give a better understanding of how Demon Slayers as an organization function. 
Quite near the beginning of the anime, you are given the information that demon slayers consist of ten ranks. However, I won't even bother remembering what they are since the anime tells them to you only once. Ever since then, one of the things I eventually wanted to see was Tanjirou earning a promotion. Maybe have his little messenger raven tell him that his actions have been recognized and therefore he's given something extra for doing a good job. Unfortunately, this never happens and it remains a mystery how good he actually is. While it might be the case that he just hasn't become good enough, considering the achievements that he made over the course of the anime and how much better he is compared to other Mizunotos (lowest rank in the organization), I half expected him to be at least somewhat recognized. However, this remains to be unknown until someone of a higher rank (other than the highest) is clearly introduced in the anime. 
The other problem I had with the anime was in the first half and it was the fact that Tanjirou was basically just doing missions after another for ten episodes and no bigger development was introduced until after. This leaves a lot to be desired in regard of world building, and I figure that this section could've been improved by, once again, adding a little more about the Demon Slayer organization. While seeing him improve as a warrior was amusing by itself and introducing a couple new characters imperative to his mission saving his sister was relieving, to me personally this isn't enough to satisfy my curiosity about what kind of an entity Tanjirou is working for. An excuse like ""Go read the manga"" isn't going to justify the fact that some things could've been worked on in the anime a little bit better, and considering the anime was running for 25 episodes instead of the usual 12, there was more than enough space for more information like this. There's a fine line between keeping a constant sense of mystery in the background and just being overly secretive, and from my personal view this discrepancy represents the latter.
Overall, Kimetsu no Yaiba is a very consistent title in the shounen genre that will most likely be remembered for years to come. I don't follow on any news myself, but if it hasn't been announced already, I am pretty sure that a second season will be introduced due to its explosive popularity. While the anime might not be a work of perfection on its own with a few flaws, these are quite minor in the bigger picture and in comparison to other shounen titles, it is more refined and much more interesting to watch. If you're an avid shounen anime viewer yourself, this is something you must watch.",9,Emenalus

                Finally we have it, the new anime about loud teenagers with cool swords fighting the ultimate evil. Another shonen jump work which I ultimately like, but have a hard time describing the experience as not frustrating. So let’s get to that.
The animation and presentation are definitely a plus, containing beautiful 3d backgrounds, that are seamlessly implemented (for the most part). The composition and usage of color are great, setting the mood really well, making for a good ominous spooky atmosphere, which in turn, really brings to life the more melancholic tragic aspects of the story. Those only come into play when we finally see the
                  demons dying, sadly. The lament for these wretched creatures, lost to all love and humanity becoming really touching. More importantly the animation is fluid where it matters, the action scenes, the audience can always follow what is happening; feel the strikes and impacts of every blow, in those. So basically this looks sex. 
Oh yeah, it also sounds sex. The music is phenomenal, impossible to find a mistake with. Every track seems to have a purpose, melody, also allowing for an entire new layer when added.  You can get the gist of a scene, the danger, peril, sadness excitement of moments, or whole sequences with the soundtrack alone. I would argue sometimes in terms of emotions, those are actually doing most of the job. Try and imagine episode 19 without the incredible track in the flashback, or the rush for the final strike. You would have a completely different fight (and a way more boring one). In terms of translating the Kimetsu no Yaiba’s story into anime, there is definitely a lot of work in crafting this show, which is shown in every episode (not mob psycho levels, but it sure is up there with the best).
In terms of narrative, it also contains some cool stuff. It understands the appeal of modern shonen, those are usually short and direct to the point. Borrowing a lot of elements and inspiration from classics in the genre, but making for a breezier, better-paced viewing. Which I would argue is great in a genre where pulpy action and excitement are 90% of the appeal (though Yaiba moves way too fast a lot of the time). Also, there is always a good sense of progression, getting slowly larger in scope, the story allowing for constantly bigger threats and enemies. I do think the show handles the whole slowly developing for a larger narrative with dozen characters, and world ending stakes somewhat neatly.
Unfortunately, there was a lot that stopped me from completely buying to the emotions of this melodramatic and exciting tale. The characters were the issue for the most part, needing a more elaborate development in several key moments. The first episode is infamous in that regard, for killing the protagonist family in the middle of its run, while giving our main 3 scenes interacting with them. On this specific situation we find the protagonist motivation, the fact he lost everything of value, while gaining determination to save his sister and fight demons.  But it feels like more of an afterthought, irrelevant, because we barely know this character, or have any grasp on the relations displayed, and bam, they die. Understanding the protagonist is essential, we need to see what he loves, get true action and moments with those people, see that family and discover why they were something to die for. The entire basis of the series relies on the Nezuko – Tanjirou bond, the thing it needs to nail more than anything. However, the introduction blows it pretty well.
The issue of never managing to land, the big importance character moments and interaction, is prevalent. There are some obvious shortcuts attempted, like both Zenitsu and Tanjirou’s main fight in the anime, rely on a memory of an important father figure. Detail, we were not aware those characters even existed before the conflict of the episode started, and their whole appearance in the narrative is through flashbacks where they say important information. These interactions and supposedly super important people have no weight, or purpose, only serving for exposition. The lack of development is almost disturbing, just try and give such appearances relevance before putting them as devices to move plot. Try and think of episode 19 without the music, suddenly there is not much to care.
Narratives inevitably become more complicated, entangled plotlines more common, complexity only tends to rise with progression. In turn this makes the need for a strong foundation really pressing, especially in the shonen genre, one infamous for introducing dozens of new characters per arc. Yaiba is giving strong signs of branching off, as lots of new super relevant people have been introduced. Nevertheless, I cannot trust our main party to hold interest at the center stage.
My boy, Tanjirou, is probably the best of a character this show has, and even him does not hold that well on his own.  Sure I may love way too good for this world boys, filled with kindness, comprehension, focus on always attempting to do what is best for the world, with everything he’s got. It may be impossible to not grow attached with the guy, seeing the lengths of effort displayed, the entire journey revolving around saving loved ones, and even more surprisingly, the own demons he uses that blade against. Goodness just comes so naturally for him, acts of helping, trying to understand, while also putting everything on the line for others, they just hit me right in the feels.
Nevertheless, no matter how much I love his nature, there is something lacking, which comes in the almost nonexistent challenges. The ideals and what Tanjirou represents are never meaningfully contradicted, and he never experiences much in terms of failure.  The ideals are too perfect, and come pretty much unscathed through the course of the story. This means he is not given much to react to, and learn from the world, or adversaries presented.  Conflict mostly comes from external, physical barriers only there to be surpassed, but are not really that meaningful or memorable. While somehow everyone else features way worst when hold to scrutiny.
Another issue comes from how Kimetsu no Yaiba is not really developing most of the concepts presented.  The anime wants to have this tragic depressing side, where the demons are representations to some of humanity deepest anxieties, and desires, perverted on these loveless creatures. All the while denying to develop, and add human characteristics for the demons through most of their appearances. Giving the whole weight of characterization, humanity through flashbacks is a really roundabout way of adding the idea. Especially when they happen just when the character is dying, i.e., there is no more conflict, i.e., they do not matter anymore.  The contrast, between the man eating monster at the surface, and human nature in the core, is barely allowed time, proper position, to shine, and make room for conflicted feelings towards the adversaries.  The fact those are inflicted souls suffering is here, but portrayed in an addendum like manner, which feels related to nothing. 
The same wasted potential can be seen on the emphasis the show gives to the importance of empathy. Shown in the signs of it wanting us to understand and care for these creatures, their humanity and existences are not objects of pity, indifference, rage, but are of worth, deserve to be respected, and ultimately acknowledged. Humans and demons alike deserve compassion, someone who will attempt to understand their pains, try and help, Tanjirou being in the role of always doing this. Nevertheless, the concept is never given relevance in the narrative, our characters never win because of understanding the demon, the knowledge of who they were as people is in effect, made practically useless. Despite the importance of bounds, helping the weak and afflicted, being something hard to deny, Kimetsu no Yaiba does not have a particularly meaningful thing to say, or topic to explore, regarding such point
Concluding, Kimetsu no Yaiba might be an action spectacle at times, with plenty of fun moments and interactions, which I would overall recommend. There were some reasons I could never completely embark in this mostly comfy show, about an impossibly good natured kid. Go for Mob Psycho for a way more interesting version of such, but you are probably going to have a better experience than me.",6,gabrielrroiz

                Demon Slayer had me shooked from the very first episode. Tanjirou went home to find out that his whole family had been slaugtered, and the sole survivor, his little sister Nezuko, had became a demon. What is worse is that Tomioka caught on that there was a new demon on the loose so he tried to kill her. But of course, we were given a VERY epic scene where Tanjirou used his smarts to defeat Tomioka. Ever since that first episode, I was hooked.
Demon Slayer is not the typical shounen/action anime. Yes, there's going to be a new demon that Tanjirou. or another demon slayer.
                  would end up defeating. However, the artsy effects that they use to portray every single move never fails to impress me. The sounds of clashing swords and water make the whole experience even more entrancing. 
But Demon Slayer is not only about fights either. We have an amazing main protagonist who is so wholesome, always there for his friends and especially his sister. He started off weak but had potential, and we see him literally go through training to become the amazing character he ended up being in the last episode. Tanjirou eventually teams up with Zenitsu and Inosuke, and they seemed whack at first, but as we watch this go through their own personal journeys, you realize that they are actually really cool too.
With that being said, I definitely recommend Demon Slayer, and I am so glad that I picked it up this season. I only recently checked the reviews/ratings/rankings for Demon Slayer, and it shook me even more that it has a whopping 8.92/10, making it ranked #20 of all time. I cannot wait for the movie to come out, and I hope season 2 comes out soon.",10,iSakuraSnow

                Anime is as much a visual genre as it is one centered around storytelling. But when one of those two things are prioritized over the other rather than treated as two halves to a whole, the work in question suffers. At around episode 14--as the artwork was becoming commonplace--I decided to stop binging the anime and analyze why it had become so boring and silly to me.
Demon Slayer (DS) rehashes a story that we're all accustomed to. There is the status quo which gets interrupted by a tragedy (the catalyst), and then The Hero is thrown into a series of events to become ""stronger"" with
                  the help of supernatural aid. The Monomyth (commonly known as The Hero's Journey) has been around for millenia; it's the focal point of thousands of stories. And yet, despite DS's lavish praise from fans, it does nothing new with the Monomyth. The series just follows the formula to a T. And if DS takes no risks with its storytelling, then it becomes easy to predict. Yes, Tanjiro gets into harrowing fights, but he's never in any real danger. He has plot armor. And timeskip level ups. Hence, if the series remains adherent to the typical Monomyth, then Tanjiro never will be in any actual trouble. He'll always win because of deus ex machina and finally save Nezuko, return home, ""save the day,"" etc. 
On that note, the whole inclusion of Nezuko is a waste. I know that sounds harsh, but hear me out: she's only there to serve as an emotional incentive for Tanjiro, but since their relationship is never established beyond some headpatting and smiling and tears, we never get a real sense of why Tanjiro is fighting for her. Wasn't their family being killed enough of an incentive already to go out and behead some evil creatures? ""But, blood is thicker than water!"" you say. Sure, but this is a story, not real life. The viewership knows nothing of Tanjiro's relationship with Nezuko beyond an impossibly blissful flashback in episode 1, and now that she's become half-demon, she's changed, so who's to say that her actions in this altered form reflect her old self? What even is her old self? An unreal feminine ideal? It's unknown. Sure, she's the last living woman of her family and just *might* succumb to her demony side (golly!), but what else is there to her character besides ""You attacked family so I angry and kick your head in"" or ""I'm tired and go to sleep, hold hand please""? Yes, she fawns over people as though they're her own family members to prove to us that she's such a loving person, but even that's fake because of Sensei's magic spell. It's weak characterization. She does fight, but only when it's convenient to the plot so that Tanjiro's plot armor looks more believable. In the end, she's there to make us feel some ""deeper"" connection to Tanjiro's plight. ""Poor Nezuko, I hope she returns to being a human again and living happily ever after! Btw, she's a pretty girl, so now I want that even more."" How cliche. And that's how the series tries to hook you: by appealing to your emotions at every turn possible. Emotions are blinding--so blinding that you're willing to ignore a weak story if you ""feel"" something for different characters. Shonen like One Piece and Naruto usually know how to time their emotional appeals, at least. Even shorter series like Bebop know how to do this well. DS doesn't know when to let up with trying to tug at your heartstrings, and thusly it ends up coming across as forced rather than natural.
It's not even an issue that Nezuko is a silent protagonist, because in the video game Transistor, this same idea is executed, but executed well. By the end of the story, you have a clear idea of who Red (the silent female) is and who she used to be. Nezuko's range of expression is limited not only because she doesn't talk, but because she's not allowed to develop beyond her few responses to things. Someone online asked why doesn't she just write things down to communicate, which was met by someone saying that was ""fallacious criticism."" Ha! Tanjiro can write, but his sister can't? Demons can talk and communicate, don't give me that bull.
The other characters aren't much better. Tanjiro is your usual happy-go-lucky shonen idiot (with a weird, unexplained sniffing power like Gon Freecs) forced to ""grow up"" because of circumstances, and the others are caricatures of tropes we've already seen hundreds of times in anime (the cowardly retard, the strong retard, the stoic retard, the girl-looking man retard, the mature older sister type, the bad Japanese humor, etc). They all act in bizarre ways as though they don't really know how human interaction works (they don't). This is fine for people who never get tired of seeing wacky Japanese archetypes being awkward, but if you're looking for a creative spin on those types, then keep on looking.
Also, why does an anime predicated on the theme of family show such a shallow portrayal of it? There were so many opportunities for some great character development that was squandered by the pacing and appearances of silly demons coming at the hero. And, come to think of it, why aren't there more demon fighters in the world if people are getting devoured or ""turned"" so frequently? Then there's the whole deal with them copying Tokyo Ghoul's ideas, which were copied from Parasyte, which copied it from elsewhere, etc, etc. I'm not saying that that type of story can't be retold, but when you take inspiration from sources that are already diluted, you're going to end up with a weak product. 
There are far, far better stories out there to read or watch that deal with DS's same themes but do it in a much better way (Parasyte, Berserk, Castlevania, HxH). DS stopped impressing me once the shininess of its visuals wore off and I quickly became disenchanted with what I was watching: a story that I'd already experienced before, albeit worse, with animation used to overcompensate for its insipid storytelling. Unlike some other shonen where the mangaka understands how verisimilitude works, DS fakes depth with its characters rather than working toward something meaningful and believable. Studios nowadays realize that shallow appeals to emotion and sugoi animation = profit, that's why great stories are few and far between now: standards have dropped to such a low that stuff like DS is managing to amaze people. It's an amalgamation of every bad shonen in recent times (Attack on Titan, Seven Deadly Sins, Fairy Tail, Tokyo Ghoul, Pandora Hearts, Hero Academia, etc) fused with the feudal Japan aesthetic and pointless inclusions of gore for that good ol' pseudo-seinen shock value. Anime of DS's kind try to hijack your emotional intelligence and win your allegiance; it's textbook manipulation. 
Sure, it feels nice to be psychologically attached to something, but if you go turning off your ability to criticize or analyze something you like or dislike, then you've stopped thinking clearly about said thing and have let it sway your emotions and decision-making capabilities. I say this only because I see so many fans lose it and curse out anyone who says something even remotely negative about their beloved Demon Slayer. Well, now I can see why they like this anime so much. But, as someone I know once said, ""fandoms are a wildfire.""

Kimetsu no Yaiba or Demon Slayer is probably what you would think it is People slaying demons. I am kinda new to this reviewing thing so go easy on me hehe. 
Demon Slayer is what it was hyped up to be and I am glad I got what I wanted out of this anime. Going into the anime I recognized most of the characters as I got spoiled on social media a bit but it didn't matter. All that matters to me is the story behind the anime and the characters if you get my jist. The tales of Tanjiro Kamado, Nezuko Kamado, Inosuke
                  Hashibira, and Zenitsu Agatsuma are quite enjoyable throughout the 26 episodes. 
Story 9/10
The main story of Demon Slayer is very good and I enjoyed watching it go throughout the series. Having an older brother have his family killed except his sister turned demon was not what I was expecting to be honest. With the assistance of Inosuke, Zenitsu, and many others. Tanjiro and Nezuko push forward in slaying the demon responsible for killing his family. I really liked how this story went from a horrific horror at the start to some of a comedy throughout the anime! (I like comedy anime a lot! As they tend to appeal to me more).
Art 9/10
I liked the art style throughout the anime and the colours as well. The animation was really impressive as with the fight scenes as well. There are some parts of the anime's comedy that I was not expecting but enjoyed as well! 
Sound 8/10
The voice acting for the dub was quite good and Inosuke (voiced by my favourite VA Bryce Papenbrook) was my favourite of the voices by far. The voices of the anime characters are quite exceptional with a few of them here and there having some eh moments. 
Character 9/10
The characters are shown well as Tanjiro being the one who wants justice for the murder of his family to  Zenitsu's cowardness and to Inosuke's hard-headedness. The expressions shown with these characters throughout the anime are quite exceptional in my opinion. 
Enjoyment 9/10
I enjoyed this anime very much through the days I've watched this and I hope this review among many others helped anyone with their view of Kimetsu no Yaiba or Demon Slayer!",9,itnotevan

Kimetsu no Yaiba or better known as Demon Slayer... This anime has been one of the best I have ever seen. Woah, hold it! Don't criticize me just yet! Let me explain.
The Story - The story is pretty simple. As you all know, Tanjiro's family is murdered by a demon and his sister is turned into one and all that kind of stuff. The story throughout is simple. Does that mean it is bad? NO! Just because it is simple doesn't make it BAD! I have seen many shows and movies (not all them anime by the way) that tried to be
                  complex that I sometimes end up even more confused than I was before. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. This show has a clear story that everyone can follow. I just wish it was a bit more complex and that they may be fleshed out Tanjiro's family a bit more. 8/10
The Art - I don't know what else to say. The art and animation are SUPERB.  The fight scenes are absolutely beautiful. The CGI is seamlessly integrated into the animation. I have to double back many times during the show to say, ""Wait, that was CGI?"" Ufotable did an absolutely wonderful job animated this. And that one scene.. Yes, you know THAT ONE SCENE.... ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL! Definitely deserves a 10/10 for art right there.
The Sound - The sound was also just as good. I feel like each voice was perfect for each of the characters. And the music... wow, the music is underrated in the show. Many people talk about how AMAZING the animation is... and it is but the music needs the spotlight as well. The opening by LiSA... is amazing. All the other pieces of music are just as great! It clearly sets the tone for each fight scene. Definitely 10/10. 
The Characters - The characters of the show are pretty enjoyable. None of them feel out of place and each of them is great together. There is plenty of character growth and not of it feels forced or too fast.  The characters themselves aren't too complex (for right now) but again that doesn't mean it is bad. I would give the characters a 9/10
Overall, the show was a pleasure to watch. It was visually pleasing, the fights were exhilarating and at times heartbreaking, and the story was clear and simple to follow. Overall, I would give it a 10/10. Despite some really minor mistakes, it was absolutely phenomenal. I know not everyone would agree with me about this, but it is fine. This  is just how I felt about the show.",10,UnorthoDon

                This anime is TBH one of the best action anime i've ever seen. Demon Slayer has quite a good plot and basically i will say the success behind this anime is it's artstyle and the OST and Opening song. Like when they gave the opening song as BG song in ep 19 and even in the last episode. They  almost made an AMV in ep 26 :3
Demon Slayer is an anime where it is the timeline of Demons and the master of all the demon is Kibutsuji Muzan. Kamado Tanjiro is the Main protagonist of this anime who has lost his whole family at
                  once by demon attack and her sister Nezuko has turned into a demon but it is a matter of wonder that being a demon his sister is supporting the Demon Slayers and she doesn't need to eat human flesh to survive which is rather extremely rare.
I will say the action, artstyle, storyline, character development, enjoyment and everything is top-notch. I will not say this is the best anime out there but i will rather say that this is one of the best action anime which deserves to take place in Top 10 action anime. Ufotable is an unknown and infamous studio. Making such an anime is obviously their revolutionary success. Infact, this studio hasn't even make an anime which ranked among top 500 (no offense). Hoping high from this studio. Just show this world what you guys can make (a good example of their artwork is episode 19. Just go check that episode out. That episode has even broke a server of Kissanime)
This anime is a story of these two youngsters becoming the top demon slayers by also getting support from two of there friends- Zenitsu and Inosuke. Their main showdown is between the demon slayer corps VS the Muzan team. Getting apart defeating Muzan, the demon slayer corps can't even cross paths with him and it is even hard for them to defeat the twelve demon moons.  Will they be able to do it? A rather tough question to say. Check this anime out to see what will be the consequences, This anime has already become famous world wide and the manga has already ended ( my request to new starters is that don't take spoilers from manga. This anime is intense. It will ruin your enjoyment.)
Hoping high from the upcoming seasons. Let's beat Kimi no Nawa and become the highest grossing movie of all time : Kimetsu no Yaiba: mugen Resha-hen. :)",10,OtAkU_TaBiB

                'Demon Slayer is a work of art, which feasts on both the eyes and the heart.’
It embraced absorbing sword styles that dance on each other; breathtaking scores that are both fierce and gentle; colorful characters in their design and personalities; daunting blend of shounen and historical genre; elegant portrayal of memories and death and a touching bond depicting a desperate brother that only want to protect his little sister. It is not confined to one particular aspect to makes that it so great, so absorbing, breathtaking, colorful, daunting, elegant and touching. With this harmonic blend, it gives rise to one of the greatest scenes anime
                  has ever pulled off in its whole history because to make up that moment, it takes in everything.
Demon Slayer is so overwhelming because of this one extra push that impacts the whole shounen genre itself. This gives a big slap of realization to show the world that even with typical shounen plot that recycles on training and killing demons, the best of the characters can still be brought out. This is the power of great storytelling. It breaks generic main characters out from their frame to be more than they are supposed to and it links a family bond in ways we didn’t expect, as it did with the chemistry created with boar-headed Inosuke, crybaby Zenitsu and other side characters. It presented determination and the resolve of the characters to be more than last-minute shouts and magical flashbacks but actually approach the danger at hand with what they can do instead of what they can’t.
Tanjirou, is an innocent and kind character without the naivety. He was brought into the world of slaying demons with harsh lifestyle that he knew nothing off, but this doesn’t take away his core of kindness. This is why he is the most efficient character in bringing out the best of others, be his foes or friends. His passionate actions inspire others and his genuine words ring so true that anyone can feel the despair and anger he has. The voice actor, Natsuki Hanae knows this feels and he nailed it. Along Tanjiro’s side is the criminally cute Nezuko. She fiercely protects her brother and other humans who she sees as her family members. Despite losing a portion of her emotions and memories, she doesn’t forget the bond forged with her family members and this shines brightly when they support each other. 
Also, she could shrink to fit inside a box.
Then there’s the drama king Zenitsu with the voice actor that sounds like he is the one having most fun with his whining, never-ending shouts and non-stopping complains. He is the most immature character that brings in laughter and seriousness in different scenarios, but the most thoughtful and realistic character when it comes to protecting a friend and facing death at its doorsteps. In essence, he is a scaredy-cat that runs and cries but he never gives up. This is one of the traits that makes him so likeable and when he sleeps, the real fun begins. Inosuke, on the other hand is a bit air-headed, who always scream and fight while trying to understand others’ feelings. Despite his relentlessness, he could calmly evaluate the situation, someone you can count on (sometimes). There’s also the mature Tomioka, a masterful swordsman with no friends.
The main highlight of Demon Slayer is the unbreakable bond shared by Tanjiro and his sister, which is finally not sexualized in any way. It is this bond that add in the sympathy element in demons Tanjiro slained, because he understands that they were once human too, like his sister. This changes how he deals with demons personally, and it gives us a better insight on his determination to protect others. He can evoke their tragic flashbacks with his compassion so that we could empathize them to an extent. To understand their bittersweet stories and how a sad-happy face could look so mesmerizing.
Adding to the merit points are the comedic scenes with the sudden change of art style, presenting trivial moments as something silly. Along with the witty dialogue and sudden change of voice intonation of voice actors, the warm interaction of the characters are better portrayed and make us want to join in as well. Action drives the show, but it is this comedy that makes it much more ridiculously entertaining.
The animation is handled by ufotable, which enhanced just about everything. Renowned for their work in Fate franchise, the fighting scenes are a charm with the use of engaging camera and transitions especially when each character has their unique elemental sword styles with various breathing techniques. The producers improvised these flashy movements that stacked one after another by adding weight to the hits landed to present a smooth flow. The characters’ facial expressions also played a major role for moments of resonance, with some accurately depicting the smile of kindness Tanjiro shows, a cold lonely look on Sabito’s face and the completely frightened Zenitsu. Everything, under their touch becomes a radiant mix of color playing well on each other.
The scores set up the ambience perfectly.  LiSA, once again composed amazing OP and ED with their own recognizable rising beats and J-rock rhythms from Sword Art Online and Fate franchise. The pitch and sound works nicely with the fade of samurai-like-music, accompanying echoes of choir that keep us at the edge of our seat. But, it is the ending song ‘Kamado Tanjiro no Uta’ from episode 19 that really put the all the songs in Demon Slayer into a perspective and it plays off as the greatest orchestral climax. A soft and gentle beat that reached its height exponentially and bring back the theme of Demon Slayer – an innocent boy just trying to protect his sister. This is the most impactful and touching message that it left to all the audiences.
Overall, Demon Slayer is more than great execution of plot, stunning visual effects, cinematic soundtracks and playful interaction between the characters. Demon Slayer, tells the tale of how people connects and within the connection, some bonds can never be shattered. Demon Slayer is, a work of art.",9,Ethan_07

                this review is simply for my enjoyment i am analyzing nothing and nothing is that serious. 
if you are considering watching this because there is a lot of hype around it, you should simply believe the hype. this anime has it all, flamboyant character design, tear jerking back stories, and children displaying a level of skill and art in combat that is unbelievable. my fave sub plot is when the characters start to learn more about themselves and how to act because tanjiro is simply that incredible. by existing he betters the lives of everyone he touches. power of friendship levels 100. i am an
                  absolute sucker for a back story i love when i can watch something and cry about other peoples fake lives so i don't have to think about my own. 
but this anime has something for everyone's taste, very versatile. 
a fews months ago everyone on twitter was really raving about this anime how it's better than naruto and whatever. honestly i was hurt a little. how could something be better than naruto? but it had been a while since i got into a new show so i thought i would just do it. and i HATE hype because i HATE being let down by things. also this is my first review and i don't understand why i cannot simply post that why does it have to be longer, no one is going to read this. ANYWAY i also love the art style when the characters fight. tanjiro's water breathing animated is stunning.",10,chaoticjunk

Demon Slayer is an anime about a kid named Tanjiro that had his family killed by a demon but only one of his family members lived and that was his sister Nezuko. Tanjiro is out with revenge to kill the person who killed almost all of his family by passing any obstacle that comes his way like getting his sister bitten to a bloody nightmare or fighting to survive. The narrative isn't the best thing in the world but at least its something enjoyable.
.
Animation: When it comes to animation the show has a lot to offer. I swear to you every frame is a
                  masterpiece. The character design in each main and side character is unique in its own way. Sometimes its stiff in frames but it can't all be perfect. The detail for everything like the hair and houses is wonderful. But I wish I would say the same thing with the character development.
Character Development: The shows characters are kind of poorly made and rushed. They do what a lot of Shonen anime do, when someone's in a middle of fight they just say there tragic backstory like growing up I got older and struggled with fighting or something like that. But the real problem I have with characters is that they all just have own personality trait and they make the worst of it. Like Zenistu, all he does is just cry and yell and he does that with just obsolete territory. But they can't all be perfect. But there's this one character that is amazingly well done. And that is the antagonist, Muzan Kibutsuji. You love him and you love to hate him. He may not have that much screen time but he is an amazing character when he does have screen time.
Plot/Story: They plot to this show is okay, so far in this season the main character in this is just going on missions. The try to make the last arc of the season be special and it kinda worked. But it just felt like every Shonen anime when they do a fight or arc.  But at least we got a good fight and a nice backstory of Tanjore's dad. At first it was going for its own style of show, but the director was just like nah lets do what everyone does. This shows plot had a lot of creative potential but through some of it away but kept a good junk of it so it could be popular. But the story is still entertainingly well done.
Music/ Soundtrack: The music in this show is outstanding. You can tell they put time and effort it the music. Who ever picked the opening and made the shows music you have a good taste. I swear the end of the fight between Tanjiro vs that spider demons soundtrack was so incredibly calming. It had a good touch to the end of that fight. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece but lets get real hear, you have to at least enjoy it a little bit.
Writing: The shows writing is pretty fine. It's good but not bad, its one of those things. I got to admit the person who writes for the wart hog for a head guy is a good writer. That wart hog dude is second to main the antagonist in the show. All in all, the writing is good enough.
CGI: This anime has CGI and for anime we all know how that turns out. But this show does it well. I haven't seen CGI in anime this good. I would say they do it better than Vinland Saga. I think Demon Slayer is one of the first animas that have done CGI non-poorly. They even use it in their fights. They mix good animation with CGI, something that has probably never been done before in a incredible way. Trust me you will not be unconfterbale when you look at the CGI.
I recommend this show to people who love adventure and combat with swords. But I wouldn't highly recommended it. If you have nothing to watch you should take a look at this.",9,TheDiamondBro

                I never really write reviews, but I feel like I had to for this one.
Story: 1/10
Genuinely one of the most boring, horribly written, cringe-worthy shounen stories ever written. This show is on-par with shows like Fairy Tail, writing-wise. The show is extremely simple and predictable, not once was I shocked, sad, happy, angry. I did not feel a single thing watching this show, other than boredom. How many times are we going to have to see your typical young boy suffers tragedy and becomes an epic super fighter story before we get sick of it?
Characters: 1/10
Shallow, undeveloped, stereotypical shounen characters that do not get an
                  ounce of development throughout the entire show. As a friend expertly said, the main trio is just Deku from My Hero Academia split into three, Tanjiro, the kindness, Zenitsu, the cowardice with occasional bravery, and Inosuke, the part that caused Deku to continuously break his arms over and over. This would be fine if any of them actually had any development (getting stronger isn't character development by the way), but they were the same throughout the whole story, not a single ordeal changed any of them. Shounen fans made fun of moe fans for liking cute anime girls during cute things, yet went berserk over Nezuko, a bottom tier anime character with no personality, who barely passes as cute, who essentially, is just a cute anime girl doing cute things. Overall, horrible characters with horrible writing, nothing out of the ordinary for shounen to be honest.
Animation & Art: 10/10
Ufotable is well-known for amazing animation and art, Kimetsu no Yaiba is no exception to this rule, no matter how bad the actual content of the anime may be. Top of the line visuals and fight scenes, amazing CG, clean art, and amazingly done backgrounds/settings. Episode 19 broke the internet, and for damn good reason, it was a genuinely beautiful fight scene. Every good thing about this anime comes right from ufotable, as the actual show accomplishes nothing, which is something to note.
Sound: 7/10
The character voice acting was average. Zenitsu, Inosuke, and about half the characters had cripplingly annoying and bad voice acting, while the rest were pretty average/decent. The sound effects of the swords and the fighting were top tier, and beautifully done. Not much to be said here.
Enjoyment: 2/10
The enjoyment of watching this show is equivalent to the enjoyment one would get chugging a litre of soy sauce. The only enjoyable thing about this show is the animation, and even then, it barely counteracts the atrocious story and writing. Frankly, this show was completely unnecessary, and probably drained some of the funds off of the new Heaven's Feel movie, so I enjoyed it even less, because it is probably lowering the quality of an actually good franchise.
Overall: 4/10
I wish I could give it a lower score, but anything lower than this would be an insult to ufotable's amazing work. I would never recommend this show to anyone, I will always laugh when I see the absurdly high score this show has, and I will consistently avoid Kimetsu fans on the internet, because they are the new My Hero Academia fans.
TL;DR: I would rather be reincarnated as Umaru-chan's Onii-chan than ever watch this anime again.",4,jimbionicles

                ** May contain very minor spoilers **
Normally I’m a bit reluctant to watch the seemingly overhyped anime series since I seem to be disappointed more times than not. However, that was not the case for Demon Slayer & I honestly regret waiting so long to give it a chance.
The main premise of the show — a kind hearted boy learns to fight demons in order to help turn his now demon sister back into a human — is not necessarily something profoundly unique, but I found the execution of the show to be incredible. The enemies Tanjiro faces are all quite interesting both in look
                  and the powers they possess, the animation (fight scenes in particular) are incredible to watch, and the characters are all very likable. Even some of the demons, although still evil and not necessarily redeemed by this, are made somewhat more likable due to the brief flashbacks you get to see of their past. I also especially appreciate that Nezuko is not some helpless girl that needs the big strong man to take care of her, as is the case in many series, but rather someone who can defend herself when necessary.
I would also like to note that I thought it was a good call to get a brief view of the main baddie in the beginning stages of the series. It’s nice to know what achieving his end goal will require Tanjiro to overcome, rather than it being some ambiguous enemy unknown to the viewer. While it is most likely assumed that Tanjiro will eventually grow to be a worthy opponent to Kibutsuji, I am definitely looking forward to see how he gets there. The ending especially has me hyped for how Tanjiro & company will face the obstacles Kibutsuji will inevitably put in their way.
My only nitpicks with the show are that the more humorous scenes are sometimes a bit hit or miss & that some of the characters (ie. Inosuke and Zenitsu) were introduced in a way that made them seem rather obnoxious. Thankfully, after the episode that introduced them, I found them to be much more enjoyable additions to this show.",10,Memorak

                I never write reviews. But after finishing Kimetsu no Yaiba, I had to make an exception. I don't write for others, but just for myself. I want to remember how I felt after finishing the anime, and everything that made it great.
From the art style, the story, the simplicity, the charming and wholesome aspect of this anime, it's one that just hits the heart in all the right ways. Many times things are painted in a ""us vs them"" and that applies to issues in real life and in stories, but this anime handles it a little differently, and in a way that I believe
                  shows emotional maturity. 
There's spoilers in here, so if anyone happens to be reading this, you've been warned.
I wasn't hooked on Demon Slayer in the beginning. In fact, I've heard people say how good it is and I've held off on watching it for over a year. Now that the Demon Slayer movie is out, and I've been watching much more anime recently, I figured I'd finally watch it. I still think the first few episodes start off a little slow. And a little simple. Demon slayer slays demons. Cute sister is cute. Main hero believes in good wholeheartedly. People arrive to deter him. He stays strong.
But after a while, it starts to change. And seeing this genuine bond between brother and sister, and not this weird sexualized version of this bond like you see in No Game No Life, I began to get hooked. Seeing the wholesome aspect of it, without Tanjiro feeling like a naive child, really made me take interest. And the fight with the shadow demon, the dodgeball demon, and demon in the house, is when I really start to appreciate and really LOVE the art style. I remember seeing the characters before like Shinobu and Nezuko but I was always put off bye the style of the eyes, the ragged lines that made up the face, and what felt at the time like really strong colors that just felt off. But then I watched the show. And it all made sense.
I was naive to put off a show on it's look and what it seemed to be, instead of giving it a chance, and I'm so glad I did.
The story is simple, but fucking beautiful. I've touched on the genuine bond but I also love how each demon is viewed with empathy from Tanjiro. When related back to real life, the people that do bad things are because they've had bad done to them. And I think many people forget that or don't realize it. Tanjiro is still mad at the injustice and how the demons have killed so many humans, but at the very least he kills them with kindness. He sees the human in them, and that's truly what I love about this show.
At the same time, the art style during the fight scenes is incredibly. The colors, the way the fight can feel realistic (if a demon turning the room in all directions was real, ofc), to the sense of calmness in Tomiaka when he fights Rui, to Shinobu and the purple and white colors, I became in awe. It's easily one of the best art I've seen in anime. Actually, it IS the best I've seen in anime.
One thing that is slept on is the sound design. During the fight with the dodgeball monster (i'm so sorry i keep calling her that) I really took note. The way the ball would feel as it flew towards Tanjiro, the way Tanjiro's sword would slice, the way Nezuko kicks the ball back and forth, was when I realize wow, not only is it all pretty to look at, but the sound is beautiful too. And not just the sound effects, but the music as well. It's beautiful, and perhaps I'm mistaken in this but it feels like it has this sense of ancient chinese culture. As well as the art style, It's just all so beautiful and I couldn't get enough of it.
When it comes to characters, I ended up loving all of them... with the exception of Zenitsu. However, even Zenitsu has his redeeming moments. The person I immediately thought of when I met Zenitsu is that this is another grapeseed from My Hero Academia. Just a pervert they added for no reason, and I was ready to drop Demon Slayer. Because I absolutely hate Minota. But I'm glad I didn't. And I'm glad I saw Zenitsu in action. He's like Sonic and The Flash, but in such a great, humurous, phenomonal way. The way he falls asleep, and then suddenly becomes a bad ass with great power. It made me excited to see when the next time we would be able to see his skill would be. So even Zenitsu, as annoying as he was at first and still tends to be sometimes, really grew on me. And towards the end, it seems like he's being taught to be more respectful and not be a pervert, so I'm glad that he's likely to go through his own amazing character art.
Lastly, I'll talk about enjoyment, which I already touched upon. At first, I just wasn't hooked. I hated the CGI personally (even though I've heard that many others find it to be great CGI) as it really took me out of the moment. A beautiful moment was ruined because it suddenly becomes ""oh...they used CGI there. Huh. It was like 2 seconds, could it not have been animated?"" but as the show goes on it uses CGI less and less and leaves it to moments in battle, which isn't nearly as bothersome. And as the show progressed, I really began to enjoy all aspects of it. And by the end, I just couldn't get enough. 
I'm watching Demon Slayer this week and although I want to wait to watch the movie, another part of me is ITCHING to read the manga. I want more of the characters. The art style, The plot. The wholesomeness. I'm here for the ride. And if it continues getting better and better, this is easily going to become one of my favorite anime of all time. 
I'm going to give Demon Slayer a 10/10. Personally, I give 10/10 to anime that make an impact on me. FMAB made an impact on me. Steins;Gate as well. I recognize that there may be some aspects of it that bother some people, and even I have some tiny qualms with both those shows, but I don't think a 10/10 is about a show being perfect, as there's so many variables that can easily mess it up. But if as a whole, it does everything amazingly, and leaves you wanting more, and makes you want to read the manga, and leaves you wanting to rewatch the show, and leaves you thinking about the moments in the show that left you in awe....I think it deserves a 10/10.
I'm super excited to see where Demon Slayer goes, to watch the movie, to read the manga. So far it's a great start. And I'm glad that I finally got on this amazing journey.",10,thatsabbydude

                Once every blue moon, a show comes around that pushes forth the medium. 
Prior to watching Demon Slayer, I felt like I was in a bit of a rut with anime - particularly shounen. I've been watching anime since I was 7, and those ""magical moments"" from watching anime had become increasingly rare for me.
Is Demon Slayer perfect? It depends on how we assess the word. Narratively, it's not pushing any boundaries by any means, following the typical ""villain of the week"" format all too common within the Shounen Jump ecosystem. The premise of Demon Slayer is indicative by its very name, a dead horse
                  that's been beaten ten feet underground. We have the typical Shounen Jump trope of ranked captains/commanders. Supporting characters include a pervert and a hothead. Yes, the typical Shounen Jump stuff. 
But that's where apt comparisons start and end. Demon Slayer is not out to push narrative boundaries to their extremes - there's plenty of shows that are far more adventurous in terms of exploring unique subject material. However, Demon Slayer is a show that knows fully well what it is - an action shounen about slaying demons. It's not there to convince us otherwise; it embraces what we enjoy about the genre and executes it to near perfection. That's the keyword here - execution. Plenty of shows get the ideas right, but fumble on execution. Demon Slayer doesn't overcomplicate its premise, and stays true to a singular goal throughout - Tanjiro is on a mission to turn his sister back into a human. That's it. It's this singular goal in mind that makes Demon Slayer feel much more cohesive than many other Shounen Jump series, which often fall into the trap of ""How do we make this go on for as long as possible?"". A clear and unifying narrative objective from the beginning frames Tanjiro's decisions and actions, providing a sense of weight and significance that I seldom feel when watching other Shounen Jump titles. Tanjiro is a main character that exudes the same purehearted energy, but without the annoying tropes of naivety and stupidity. His competence and determination to achieve what he sets out to do makes him a breath of fresh air. Demon Slayer is by no means unique by premise, but does everything that it sets out to do with precision and near perfection. 
By far the biggest plus for the show is its animation and art. The sheer amount of work that ufotable put behind each sequence and each frame during fight sequences is breath-taking. Camera and character movement is purposeful, guiding us through fights with a remarkable sense of fluidity and cohesion. Each fight carries weight, and rarely feel like a true ""win"" due to the delicately-crafted flashback scenes. Prior to death, we are given an intimate look at each demon's human past. Tanjiro's compassion and understanding comes through beautifully during these moments thanks to ufotable's exceptional composition. While each victory leads Tanjiro closer to his goal, we can see he does it out of necessity; not for enjoyment or to achieve a sense of victory. All of the elements that made Demon Slayer truly special culminated in the now-famous fight scene in episode 19. After the episode ended, I realized how grateful I was that I was witnessing something truly special. I felt emotional because of how Demon Slayer was able to make us feel like we were actually part of Tanjiro's journey, and I was reminded of why I fell in love with anime in the first place as a kid. 
That's what makes Demon Slayer so remarkable to me. It's not unique in premise. It's not unique in terms of mechanics. But it's unique in how it brings it to life - and pushes the boundaries of how we perceive action shounen. Demon Slayer was a turning point for the industry, and raised the bar for the genre - whether you like the show or not.",10,Mase207

                Kimetsu no Yaiba, or Demon Slayer, an overhyped, overrated and over almost everything show that fans can't stop praising and talking about this hell of a mess.
Yes, after a year or more from dropping it initially, I have completed it and rest assured, it's not as good as people say it is. 
This is my super deconstructive take on the show.
From the studio that brought you, urgh, Fate comes another stupidly popular mainstream series that is Demon Slayer. Where do I start, I can't comprehend to you how much it irritates me or saddens me when a friend or anyone comes up to me and
                  say 'dude you should check out Demon Slayer it's really good', just for me spoil their fun by saying 'it's not that good'. Without fail, almost everyone that I have encountered replies 'What? No way. It's great!'. I am truly annoyed by how big this series has become, how this low-tier Shounen series has managed to climb it's way to the top due to shameless fan-service or fan-baiting if I would call it. I'll admit, I didn't hate all of it. But to compare it to what people say it is and to actually watch it firsthand, you can eat my shit. This show is nowhere close as good or as 'legendary' as a ton of people are saying it to be.
I'll start with the good side of the show. Yes, I'll admit, the visuals are very good. With the show's distinctive thick outlines of characters to the colorful template of the character's clothing. This show is really unique in terms of style and visuals, everyone who sees's a character or anyone from the show would know immediately that this is Demon Slayer. And... That's about it, that's all that is that caught my attention or in some ways interest me.
Now, this is where the fun begins, the downfalls. For a start, this show's story is painful mediocre and lame. It's a very simple concept of our protagonist suffering from what the antagonist did in the beginning and it's just him finding his way back to bring vengeance on to this antagonist. I don't mind a simple structure of a story, but what you need to do to make that simple structure interesting is to add in the details and to make all those small matters an enjoyable experience. What Demon Slayer presented was pretty repetitive with our main character fighting and then getting summoned to another mission and repeat. I do compliment them with the addition to more main characters to our Tanjirou and Nezuko pair because, to be frank, our main boy Tanjirou isn't really an enjoyable character to listen to. But what the studio did when filling in those gaps in between plots are kinda poorly done. At times, the pacing is off, and off I mean very off. Those times are when the characters talk too much and fight scenes don't really feel as fast-paced or as action-packed as it should. At moments the time just seems to pass so slowly and other moments are sonic fast. 
The second installment of the downfall, the characters. Tanjirou is one of the most Naruto kind of character since Naruto. His over-optimistic behavior paired up with his never-ending feeling of 'not giving up' is truly annoying. But what I want to focus on him is how the show tries so hard to push his plot-armor. Specifically, episodes 18, 19 and 20. These few episodes just blew my mind on how is he still alive, I know everyone's protagonist needs to have some level of plot-armor but, what the show did wasn't even hiding it. There are so many moments where I went 'he's gonna die' and miraculously, he lives! Who would have seen that coming... Not just once, I counted at least 5 times where Tanjirou was sure to die and he didn't, this really pisses me off. I can just imagine the writers/author was going through when making the scene, 'Oh so our dude is fighting one of the broken bad guys, so the bad guys used this fucking lightsabers-ass web-shooting thing, oh so he just avoids it no biggy. Oh, he's sword is broken? No worries he still can do more DAMAGE WITH A BROKEN SWORD AND PERHAPS WIN.' Sure. Now that I knew the background before the fight scene in episode 19 (before I didn't) it just removes all the enjoyment I had when seeing that fight scene alone.
Another fucking issue is the villain, like, we got this Michael Jackson wanna-be asshole that is just turning people into demons. We later got to know that he's a boss man that handles big important business, then this comes to my head. Why was he in the woods near Tanjirou's house? Like we have seen him hiding in the city in Tokyo, what brings him to a village? Plus, what are his main goals? This is another big issue of the show, characters or antagonists having no purpose or driving factor. So take Muzan, he's the boss, turning people into demons. So what does he want to do, take out the Hashira? So what is he gonna do after that, take over Japan? Ok then what. See where I'm coming at? Like they have no driving factor or a strong purpose to what their goals or objectives are. So Tanjirou wants to cure his sister, the ONLY demon that has ever been friendly to a slayer out of the WHOLE years of the Demon Slayer Corps. But why? I don't see an issue, she's clearly having a pretty good time being a demon, I don't see the issue, this is a win-win in my eyes. Speaking of villains, gosh they suck. They're the usual badly bad guys in almost any lame-ass Shounen series. Like in episode 20, the reason for that Rui spider motherfucker's purpose was to make a family? Are you serious? Like, was he that pathetic and trying so hard to be pitiful that we the audience are supposed to swallow that shit? This brings me to my third installment.
The overuse of trying to be pitiful. This can be seen almost everywhere throughout the show, we have main characters and side characters and villains all having a tragic past likey involving their parents or family getting killed so on and so on. If the author or writers are so tryhards on this then fine, I pity them for doing such a poor job or trying to make the depths of the characters. Every time, without fail, our main dude Tanjirou when fighting an intense match will suddenly talk about his parents or how he wants to bring Nezuko back to normal. Not just him but the majority of the characters have a tragic backstory or a past and they talk boring shit about how they want to avenge or overcome that challenge. Boring stuff I'll say. Speaking of pity, I really pity the person who comes up with the script or maybe it's the person making the subtitles. In episode 7 where Tanjirou was in that demonic swamp puddle involving that 3 demons, he said 'The air was thinner on top of Mt.Sagiri!'. You idiot, you're not a fish you can't breathe underwater, there is no air under the water you moron. There are other moments of stupid scriptwriting but this is one of them.
Lastly, and there's actually more but I'll cut it short, I want to talk about the laziness of the author. Does it kill them (preferred pronoun) to do some research when making the world and character? So for a start, the character Inosuke, seeing him with two swords wants to make me kill myself. While yes there are records of people using two swords, not at once you fucking dingus. Come on with have experienced this a few times now, a popular one being Deadpool. It's not very functional when using two double-handled swords, both swords make it very impractical due to one sword blocking the other or the strength distribution not being even. Another this is the occasional technological gap, there are times when what seems like the dawn of man when the whole surrounds are just trees and suddenly a bustling city like Tokyo. There are cars and trains available so why do we only see them so occasionally. Plus, gosh there are guns in this era, all of you aren't savages using swords all the time. Speaking of swords, the only interesting one was the sword-rapier that Shinobu used, the rests are just your typical samurai sword action. This plays a small part in the story but it affected my enjoyment.
-SCORES-
Character-3/10: Everyone has either no family or families been killed or they'd peed their pants in their early days or just something tragic happening at a young age. So Zenitsu's a simp, but I do like the part when he used his simp-ness to his advantage in the training involving girls. Plus, he's really noisy, slightly too noisy I feel, over-exaggerated to just give the borderline audience some 'unique character personality'. Inosuke, also sometimes too extra, like I feel they are too scripted in being 'them', being loud and over the top. It gets tiring fast. Fuck Tanjirou, he's too entitled thinking he's the only one that lost his family thinking he is the only one that can stop Muzan. Even Nezuko I'll admit she's way to fan-bait like she's just cute for the audience to say 'oh my gosh she so kawaii' and stuff like that. I don't really care cause I feel all these are just cheap shots to gain a fanbase, what's worse is that it has succeeded.
Art-8/10: I will say despite the animation looking smooth and pleasing, I do see times of underproduction due to the long talk time or the irritating flashbacks or the reuse of scenes. Plus, I realized that after the studio started using those 'funny faces' with the dotted eyes and silly expression, they used it way too many times. Another cheap move to attract viewers.
Writing- 3/10: Oh is it boring, I will admit the problems do become numb after the first half of the show and the rest is just bad but at a consistent level. I will admit the Fire Force has a more interesting concept that this but they didn't do a better job than Demon Slayer of course. Definitely a good example of a top-notch Shounen is, of course, Hunter X Hunter. I feel what Demon Slayer is doing with the writing is lazy but they just get most of the pull factor from the audience is the art and the visuals.
Sound-5/10: Holy shit is the sounds overused, every time a demon appears that 'aaaaaaaaaaaaa' sound of a woman singing comes up and every intense scene has that same repetitive fight song. Additionally, I heard the intro gets a lot of praise and I really don't see the appeal, sure it's fine but it's so anime-ish that it's blain and boring. Just a catchy chorus with FAST SING is what you need to get a ton of likes apparently....
Overall, I expected shit and I got shit, I pressed X to doubt to all those people that said Demon Slayer is good. If it weren't so overhyped, definitely my scores will be slightly less biased but seeing and experiencing the situation of the 'Demon Slayer Hype' is really annoying.

                “We’ll be going together, even if it’s to hell.” - Rui’s Father
I’m not normally one to care about what other people feel about certain anime. After all, taste is subjective and there are no right or wrong opinions. But there is a certain word that gets constantly thrown around when discussing this anime that honestly makes my blood boil. The word is “overrated.” What usually accompanies is a whole slew of erroneous criticisms of Demon Slayer’s writing based entirely on misunderstanding. The usual sentiment is “the visuals are good but the writing is mediocre,” said to seem intelligent while confidently missing the point of the
                  writing.
Now don’t get me wrong, Demon Slayer is not perfect, far from it. There are plenty of valid criticisms of how it was composed but “overrated” is so often used to sidestep them and avoid analysing through any form of artistic lense. So in this review I will be explaining in no uncertain terms the heart of Demon Slayer’s writing and hopefully convincing some less astute viewers why Demon Slayer deserves the praise that it has received. I will do my best to avoid spoilers but there may be some slip ups.
Demon Slayer has three core themes: the tragedy of losing one’s humanity, the coexistence of anger and compassion, and the strength that arises from love.
Despite the name “Demon Slayer,” the story goes to great lengths to ensure that the demons in the show are humanised. Almost every significant demon that we meet is given a backstory and a flashback to their time as a human. The demons’ attributes are often related to what they cared about back when they were human which is usually expressed through their respective Blood Demon Arts. The show puts on full display how the things we cherish as humans can become twisted and sinister should we lose our humanity and moral compass. It provides a tragic juxtaposition of the bloodthirsty monster overcome by instinct and the passionate people they once were. Demon Slayer is trying to get the viewer to empathize with the terror of losing yourself and your identity to the point where no one, not even yourself, can forgive what you’ve done. This empathy expressed through the protagonist Tanjiro Kamado reflects the next theme.
One of my favorite lines from the show which I believe encapsulates this theme very well is when Tanjiro says, “I understand you but I cannot forgive you.” What is being communicated is that these demons have killed many people and as should die for it, but that should not bring us to blind hatred and lack compassion for them. After all, they too were once human who were transformed into demons against their will. We often feel as though compassion and anger are mutually exclusive sentiments, but Demon Slayer speaks to the importance of having resolve in compassion and empathy in anger. This theme is expressed through many characters, most starkly through Shinobu Kocho, who puts into more mature words the sentiments of our protagonist. It is a consistent undercurrent in the show that gives it its more sympathetic tone.
The last and most easily observed is the strength that arises from love. On the surface, this may seem like the stereotypical “protecting the people you care about” that we see time and again in Shounen shows, but Demon Slayer brings a fresh perspective on this idea. It is observed most clearly in the character dynamic between the protagonist Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko. Unlike what some viewers may expect, Nezuko is not relegated to the role of damsel in distress as Tanjiro beats the bad guys for her. Rather, both Nezuko and Tanjiro are both highly competent and they give each other the resolve to fight. Demon Slayer shows that love, and the strength that it gives, goes both ways.
Story - 9
As I have discussed, the macro-level writing for Demon Slayer is handled with a great deal of skill and nuance. On the other hand, the micro-level writing also shines through with the excellent work of director Sotozaki. The show does an excellent job of building tension leading up to climaxes and releasing tension afterward without diminishing its importance. In all the conflicts it is felt that the characters are truly in danger and trying their hardest. An excellent example of this would be when Tanjiro’s sword was broken by the spider’s thread. It put into perspective just how incredibly outmatched he was. The pacing is excellent and makes it so that each episode leads seamlessly into the next, creating one long, cohesive story. One issue I have with the writing is that it occasionally chooses the wrong things to do in-depth explanations. There were key plot points that I was not able to pick up until rewatching that I believe could have been expressed better. I can understand why some viewers call these events Deus Ex Machina if they are unable to notice the subtle foreshadowing.
Art - 10
I think this should be pretty self-explanatory. Ufotable clearly cut no corners in the visual production of this show. I don’t think I need to tell anyone that the fight scenes are beautifully animated with phenomenal attention to detail. Even beyond that, the art is consistently clean and crisp which really helps the unique style that the artists were going for. The visual metaphors that accompany the sword-work are extremely creative and add serious excitement to even relatively grounded abilities.
Sound - 10
The sound design for Demon Slayer is absolutely brilliant. As I mentioned in my “story” section, the writers are able to build tension to great effect at various points in the show. The soundtrack plays a big part in this. Each track perfectly accompanies the moment and its tone, whether it be sentimental or grandiose. There are certain moments that would be otherwise difficult to swallow but the sound direction makes completely natural. By far the best example would be the first time we see Zenitsu’s hidden abilities. It is a brilliant subversion of expectations made all the more impactful by the introduction of his theme that would go on to appear more in the series.
Characters - 9
The characters are nothing short of iconic. In just a year after release, many Demon Slayer characters are ubiquitously recognized in pop culture. This is due in no small part to the concise characterization that each of them receive. The show ensures that the viewer is able to get the main ideas about a character very soon after their introduction, and further elaborate beyond that. This allows for expedient and efficient character building that still feels organic in the moment. What makes this all the more impressive is that the show always leaves unanswered questions and room to expand upon. That’s why so many of the characters have an air of mystery and awe. It is unfortunate that due to its relatively short run time for a Shounen, Demon Slayer has yet to demonstrate the full potential of its strong cast. If character writing of this caliber continues, this section will be an easy 10.
Enjoyment - 10
There is good reason for Demon Slayer’s mainstream success. Even if you watch it at its most surface level, you will still be thoroughly entertained. Most people can pick up Demon Slayer and get great value out of it without having to devote serious time toward analysis. However as I have discussed, there is much to be appreciated if one does put in serious analysis. This, I believe, is the root of the problem with many Demon Slayer viewers. They watch the series, see its surface level qualities, and assume that those are all that the series has to offer. I implore all viewers to think critically about this anime and I guarantee that you will get more out of it.

                The first season absolutely has a lot of potential. I probably think that this is is gonna be the future Shounen King. With Ufotable's out of the world animation and heartbreaking OST by Aniplex of America and amazing fight choreography it's bound to do so. Also it doesn't have much shounen tropes eventhough it's quite generic, for example Tanjiro doesn't always save Nezuko, it's quite the opposite also a fair number of times, also the protagonist doesnt have any grand goal. Further proof is that ep 19 was trending on twitter.The opening is amazing, sang by Lisa who is already a singer of a no.
                  of OP's and EDs. The difference btw this anime and black clover which another generic shounen with a lot of tropes is that it gives us something to connect to, for instance the sibling bond. And also the others of the main cast are quite well received by fans, Inosuke being a fan fav. I m really hyped for the movie and hope it lives up to the hype and that a second season comes out soon.",10,Ochita_Ou

                Is this the best anime ever? No, it isn't.  Is it really better than Death Parade? Probably not, but I don't care.  The beautiful music, the fluid animation, the great character design, and talented voice work all come together to make an amazing experience.  The story is the weakest part but it's not a bad one.  Rather than having Tanjirou want to be the best and the strongest like every other shounen protagonist, Demon Slayer has his motivations based on the unbreakable bond between him and his sister.  All he wants to do is to save his sister.  He
                  constantly  sympathizes with many demons even though he can't forgive them.  Showing his empathy rather than showing in one scene he saving a jerk and everyone is surprised, or his saying out loud that he will never ever give up on his friends. 
 Which is quite refreshing.  The fight scenes are some of the best in anime yet.  The best one (you know the one) is what this anime is really about.  A beautiful anime contrasted with its elegant storytelling.  Ufotable did a fantastic job adapting the manga by making the art better than the manga and the music is so good perfectly matching the tone of each fight and knowing when to focus on the fight and then the music and then both at the same time.  This is my favorite anime of 2019 even though Beastars is objectively better probably.",10,Artfishbot

The Appeal of Demon Slayer:
Part 1:
What is the appeal of the Demon Slayer franchise? My first response to this question would be the premise. As a fan of both Seraph of the End and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, I wasn’t surprised to find myself hooked by the first chapter of the Demon Slayer manga. I find the the premise of these three stories to be very appealing, I love the idea of having a character not only lose their entire family, but to then have a member of their family survive, only to be turned into the very creature responsible for
                  the massacre (Kabaneri diverges slightly, having the protagonist be the one turn into the creature). What I find so appealing about this premise is that it is the perfect plot device. Having the protagonist lose their entire family at the start of a story effectively leaves them with nothing left, they must rebuild their lives. It allows for the protagonist to simply move forward, since they no longer have anything to go back to. They are also left resenting the creatures who ruined their lives, the addition of having a surviving family member turn into one of these creatures ensures that the main character’s rage will never subside. Demon Slayer follows this formula well which may been seen as a negative by others, but if you’re a fan of either of the other series I mentioned (or AOT) then you’re sure to enjoy Demon Slayer. Demon Slayer also slightly diverges from the protagonist resenting the creatures (demons in Tanjiro’s case) as Tanjiro is actually able to empathise with the demons, which is seen as a weakness by other characters, but I find it to add a lot of nuance to his character. The bloodthirsty, revenge driven main character archetype has started to lose its touch as of late, therefor, the mangaka behind Demon Slayer’s decision to change things up is a very welcome one. 
In summary, Demon Slayer’s premise isn’t incredible original, but as someone who generally likes it in other stories, I find it to be very appealing and one of Demon Slayer’s biggest strengths. I have only touched on the premise, but there is still so much that is great about Demon Slayer, expect more posts coming soon.
Part 2:
I have already gone into a great deal of depth explaining what I think the appeal of Demon Slayer’s premise is, so in this post I will be touching on what else is so great about Demon Slayer. I won’t go into as much detail since I think that the premise is the most crucial part, but I shall endeavour to touch on everything that I like.
The character designs in Demon Slayer are, in a word, fantastic. They are very striking and leave a strong impression on you, it is a great feat for a character design to so perfectly represent the personality of a character, but Demon Slayer is able to pull this feat off consistently. 
The characters in general are also strong, I would say that Tanjiro could be a better protagonist, however, he does his job well and enables the mangaka to introduce more interesting characters as the story goes on. 
When it comes to the anime adaptation, only three episodes may be out, however, all have had brilliant visuals. The use of CGI is actually beneficial to the anime, which is very rare for a modern anime. The CGI allows for lots of great camera movement, mainly the fantastic tracking shots of Tanjiro that have been shown thus far. I also love the effects, such as the fog and snow, they create an environment that feels real. Despite being animated, the world that the characters inhabit actually feels lived in and authentic. I really cannot stress how much this does for an anime. 
The soundtrack is also great, the song that played when Tanjiro was preparing to leave for the town in the first episode was one of the best soundtracks I’ve heard in anime. It really gave off the feeling that despite the fact that Tanjiro was only leaving to go to town, a mundane task, he was really setting out on a grand adventure, which is what happened.",9,IcarusxIcarus

                I may be a bit biased in terms of all the ratings, but I can rationalize every single one, so really, how biased can I be...
*May contain minor spoilers.
Kimetsu no Yaiba / Demon Slayer is a masterpiece, plain and simple. And frankly, I'm tired of plenty of more old-school anime enjoyers pretending it's not. 
The story itself is fantastic. It's simple and straightforward, and yet it's got plenty of depth that makes it so interesting and keeps me, as well as many, many others, coming back for more. The concept of family being important being driven home is so dear to my heart, and it
                  means a lot to me to see it handled in such a fantastic way. They don't just say ""blood family is important, don't abandon them"", but they explore the depth of what ""family is important"" can mean.
Nezuko is his blood family. Friends Tanjiro meets along the way become family. But more than that, Demon Slayer also goes in on how even though you may be family with someone (ignoring the fact that the Spider Family isn't real family, the point the story makes is still relevant) it doesn't mean you can treat them how you please. Family is important, but what the story really emphasizes is that healthy, loving family is important. And that those you love dearly are the true family.
Art and animation? What else would I expect from Ufotable? Utter brilliance. It's no MAPPA adaptation, but the animation and style still has a charm that fits the manga's style to a T. It's not the kind of anime that needs a MAPPA level animation quality, in my eyes. The style Ufotable has lavished unto this series suits it perfectly.
The characters are all pretty great, as well. Honestly, I would chock it down a point for some of the characters introduced (not to start an argument, but Zenitsu could use some work) but Tanjiro in particular strikes me as an especially well-written character. He's kind, but that's not the only thing about him. His depth is incredible. He's kind, yes, and that's so important, but he's also not hesitant to cut down those who go against his laws--the strong protect the weak, and the weak in turn become strong to protect those weaker than them. He empathizes with demons, but this does not cloud his judgement nor waver the strikes of his blade.
It's got me hooked to see more. It's the most enjoyable series I've had the pleasure of watching/reading. I'd deeply, deeply recommend Demon Slayer to ANY anime watcher, new or old. You won't regret it.",10,Lunachuu

                Katanas have been my weapon of choice since before I started watching anime, and Kimetsu no Yaiba just made that decision a lot stronger. Feeling as if the story would start by going easy on me, I started watching the anime after many months of its final chapter´s official release. The reason? I´am not particularly attracted to anime that becomes famous quickly, but after months of seeing that this one was on the top most watched animes for a long time, curiosity knocked at the doors of my brain. So, as I said earlier, I thought the story development would go easy on me at
                  the start, leading me in a rising direction towards an epic climax of a final fight, so naive was I this time.
Instead of that typical structure, the story gave me goosebumps from the very beggining, strangely feeling like danger was at my doorstep as the first episode was only beggining, and I questioned myself: Why? It looks so peaceful, so happy, like sunrise in the morning, but it was only the start of an epic voyage with the strong and inspiring will of the protagonist, the proximity of death at each footstep, having your chest at the limit between absolute suspense, and that ecstasy attained only when the final blow has been dealt. This journey is taken along with our protagonist, struggling to be stronger every time, just to end realizing a heavy truth: ""we can never be strong enough, both in our physique and in our willpower"".",10,Ryunushi

                First let me say, Kimetsu no Yaiba has great animation. I honestly don't mind the CG use too much but besides that I thought it was very unique and something I haven't seen before. The fight scenes are enjoyable and I like to see the solutions that Tanjiro comes up with to defeat his enemies. The music and sound design are also pretty good, however, I'm not a huge fan of the music.
Unfortunately, that's about it for the good parts of this show. The storyline is super generic, guy wants revenge and to save his sister, so he joins a group of Demon Slayers to
                  fight evil. Wow. The demon concept is interesting, but I think sometimes it can be awkward to fit in decapitations of human eating demons with scenes of wacky characters, right after a death.
That's probably my least favorite thing about this show actually. The characters just don't fit, at least in my opinion. Tanjiro the protagonist seems very cookie cutter and the yellow haired kid is annoying to say the least. You would think a show with a generic plot would make up for it with good characters that don't get on your nerves too much, but watching their conversations and interactions was very boring and I could pretty much tell exactly what each character was going to say before they said it.
Kimetsu no Yaiba is very.... okay. I'll continue to skip the boring parts and try to see what direction the anime goes but after all, this could of had so much potential.  6/10",6,toasterinmytub

Summary:
I've read the whole manga after finishing season 1 and can't wait for the rest of the series to be animated.  The emotion that the author is trying to express in this story was perfectly delineated and the character development throughout the series is amazing.  What makes this amazing is that the series won't be dragged on forever and actually comes to an end.  The ending could've been better but I'm 100% satisfied with the battles.  The art is over the top but there's too much yelling in the anime however that's how it is so I'm not so
                  particular in that.  There's almost no unlikable characters, all of the characters are so lovable, even the ones you thought you hated at the start.  At the beginning, getting to know the demon's backstory's got repetitive but then it was still worth knowing because of how it lead up to me hating Muzan even more haha but that's just a personal opinion of mine.
Full Review:
Demon Slayer is such a masterpiece for those who like to be emotionally invested to a Shounen anime. The first noticable thing about this show is that the CGI sometimes looks unbelievably realistic such as the foregrounds, backgrounds, skyviews, the moon, the sun, the trees and more. Camera movements and character movements are also top-notch and the details are excellent.
The plot is simple and easy to understand. It's a typical shounen where our protagonist starts out as a weak character, gets trained to become the strongest character ever to avenge their lost ones, etc. But the great thing about this anime is that (knowing from the manga) it won't be stretched out for so long that watchers will get sick and tired of it (I wouldn't have). For those who prefer animes that are long, but not *too* long, this anime will be for you.
The character developement in this show is too much. Too much goodness, that is. If you're open minded, you may find yourself liking all of the characters for several different reasons because these characters just capture your heart. Whether it's for their personalities, their backstories, their looks, there seems to always be a reason to like a character in this show. You might even find your favourite character to be a demon. The one and only person I dislike is Muzan but that's just because maybe I'm not open-minded enough to bring myself to like him and one other demon (I will not mention due to spoilers) but there are sooo many respectable, lovable characters in this series and makes the show worth watching.
All of KNY's soundtracks are utter masterpieces. The music they use in different scenes really really puts you in the mood. They remind me of Lord of the Rings soundtracks because of how beautiful they sound. The emotional weight they bring about is remarkable. The reason why I'm bringing it down one score for ""sound"" is because of the yelling in the show. In my opinion, it gets annoying because sometimes the yelling becomes overused which ""over expresses"" the situation but honestly, it's not that big of a deal. It's what Demon Slayer is known for.",10,K1N0SUKE

                A true masterpiece of recent years. This series has a quality that I have rarely seen in anime. Simply outstanding.
The story hooks you from chapter 1 and makes you want to see more when it's over. For me, almost all the chapters were very short to see and left me with a great feeling to discover what will happen in the next one. The structure of the chapters is very well maintained so that not a single dialogue or scene becomes tedious or difficult to visualize. 
The animation is incredible, taking care of everything in detail, which greatly increases the value of the visual experience.
                  It's amazing how they manage to make the water areas, the trees, the mountains, the sky, look like real life recordings. Incredible CGI work, and also without abusing it, since the fights and action scenes in the foreground are 100% drawn. The animation, therefore, is very clear and develops in a very natural way. It is undoubtedly the highlight of this anime, along with obviously its plot.
The soundtrack is also very successful, managing to put you in tension when necessary and relax when the ""storm"" is over.
The characters are very charismatic and in my opinion there is not a single one that is useless. Each and every one of them fulfills their role perfectly, which makes it a very good quality adaptation.
To sum up, a 100% recommended series. Seeing it has been, worth the redundancy, a great experience.",9,pablillo96

                Gotta say, after completing this anime, you've gotta be questionably mad to drop this show. This anime definitely goes onto my list of one of my top anime ever. While I won't spoil the plot of this anime in this review, I will assume that you have at least read a blurb for this anime. If you are completely blind to this series and don't even want to know the premise, I'll caution you to avoid this review. Kimetsu no Yaiba is a shounen anime that explores a world set in Taisho era Japan festering with demons that antagonize humanity and the eponymous demon slayers
                  who deal with them. Our protagonist is Tanjiro Kamido, a young boy who finds himself introduced to the demon slaying life after being faced with tragedy. Accompanying him is his younger sister, Nezuko Kamido, who is gravely affected by the tragedy when she is transformed into a demon. Following this, the two begin a journey in order to find a cure to reverse Nezuko's transformation. Now, I know the premise is a bit mediocre but this anime makes up for it with its interesting characters and captivating animation.
(STORY & CHARACTERS) While the background for the siblings isn't quite unique, their personalities are compelling enough to keep me invested in them. Tanjiro is is our brave, and empathetic protagonist that is willing to combat the fearsome demons, but is also capable of showing compassion for his enemies. Fortunately, Tanjiro's compassion doesn't extend quite as far as most shonen protagonists', so it isn't grating. Meanwhile, Nezuko's condition relegates her to a mute character, but this anime still finds a way to keep her interesting with her demonstrative face in addition to the expressive voice acting (in the sub at least). The primary villain, while still an enigma, is still compelling and intimidating based on the few scenes we're given. As with any anime, the two main characters encounter and befriend allies that manage to remain distinct from one another, yet still a bit unoriginal if I have to be honest. Despite this, I've found myself quickly enjoying them as well.
(ANIMATION & SOUNDTRACK) The best part of this anime for me has to be its interesting animation and mesmerizing soundtrack. This anime has quite a distinct art style that will definitely make it one to remember especially when compared to the other anime series that have been introduced this year. Each character design is unique, making it easy to distinguish characters from one another. The fight scenes are where the animation stands out the most for me. The art compliments the fighting style of each characters as it makes use of bold lines and attractive colors, somewhat reminiscent of Japanese ukiyo-ye. The music fits well with each environment we are introduced to in this anime and has yet to disappoint. 
If you're into action anime with a bold, sword-wielding protagonist, you'll probably like this anime. If you're looking for a well-animated series with an memorable moments, you'll probably like this anime as well. Anyone may find this anime enjoyable as long as they remain patient. You may find the first two episodes a bit slow (I didn't, but apparently some people did), but I recommend you try to continue. You likely won't regret it!",9,johnthegreenseer

                Hi all my friends, we find ourselves for a new review and - / WALL /
I want to remind you that I write very rarely reviews, so necessarily my style and my development will not be of an irreproachable quality, do not expect some Edgar Allan Poe-esque novel
When I heard about Kimetsu no Yaiba for the first time, I was rather intrigued, and happy, because I was still watching Dororo and I realy liked that atmosphere of ancient Japan with samurai and demons
As for many seasonal anime, I inquired to the bare minimum, if at all, so as not to spoil me anything. Did I
                  regret it? No.
But enough of procrastination, let's go directly to the review.
Story : 8/10
If we look more closely, the story of Kimetsu no Yaiba is not really special, or unique. It is rather banal. But good, refreshing and very pleasant to follow.
If it does not shine by its complexity, its denouements or its depth, it remains very appreciable. I never found myself pointing at scripting mistakes, inconsistencies or even pacing issues. Well, I must say that I am very good public.
I let myself be carried away by the story of Kimetsu no Yaiba, and it was a particularly pleasant trip.
Art : 10/10
One of the big highlights of this anime.
There is so much to say ...
First, the setting is often very pretty, the anime is mostly in rural areas which allows to show beautiful landscapes, often detailed and wild.
The more urban atmosphere is very surprising, because we are talking here of Japan from the beginning of the 20th century, a Japan that enters modernity but still deeply rooted in its traditions and its rurality. The contrast between the countryside and the city is bluffing.
The animation during the fights is impeccable, nothing to say on it. Of course, we immediately think of episode 19, but each fight of this anime was beautifully animated. The visual of the breath attacks is particularly beautiful.
Finally, of course, let's talk about the CGI.
As I already said in another review, I am VERY sensitive to the CGI in animes, and in almost all cases, I find it ugly and it lowers my enjoyment. Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of the few animes where this is not the case.
The CGI is MAGNIFICENT. Not just ""passable"" or ""ok"", it's really beautiful. In addition, it gives rise to spectacular scenes, such as the fight against arrow and balloon demons, or more recently in the Inception-like maze of Muzan.
Soundtrack: 10/10
The other strong point of this anime. First of all, I love the opening, it's one of my favorites all anime included. The ending is also very beautiful, these are points that are really important for me in an anime.
But what about the OST ? This is one of the best I have ever heard ! The association of Western orchestral music with traditional Japanese music gave me eargasms. The music is brilliantly used throughout the anime, and contribute enormously to the creation of all this special atmosphere that continuously emanates from KnY.
Characters: 9/10
That we agree: KnY characters do not have a complexity out of the ordinary, as is the case for some anime. Yet, I appreciate them (all) enormously.
Demons often have an interesting backstory that helps the viewer to sympathize with them, without going into melodramatic Naruto-like backstories.
The pillars also have an interesting personality and story. For now, we have only been able to see Shinobu's, but having read the manga and without spoil, I can simply say that the other pillars are mostly extremely nice and their stories well built too.
The same goes for other secondary characters, who show admirable feelings, and who never fall into the generic and cliché behaviors.
Tanjiro, the protagonist, is incredibly pleasant. We have an intelligent MC, who is reasonable in his judgment and decisions, and who ... is just incredibly human. It is very rare to see a shonen protagonist who shows compassion, a virtue that is essential for a human being. This compassion (which is not naivety, beware of that) makes Tanjiro very pleasant and attracts all the sympathy from the viewer.
In contrary to what some people feel, I really appreciate the character of Zenitsu. Yes, he screams a lot, yes, he is noisy. I totally understand that it can annoy a lot of people. But ... that's not my case! I appreciate his role as a comic relief.
The same goes for Inosuke, who, in addition, has an interesting development as he spends time with Tanjiro and Zenitsu.
Reject it or not, but Inosuke is the best waifu.
And, of course, let's finish with the best: Nezuko. I have rarely seen such a lovely and at the same time as useful character. It would have been easy to create a cute but plug-and-play character, who just does some cute stuff. But this is not the case of Nezuko, who in addition to being cute, will go and beats up the mouths of the bad guys.
She is already the source of many memes on the Internet, and she deserves it totally. Praise Nezuko.
I also want to add that I love the relationship she has with her big brother. It's Japan, so it would have been hardly surprising to have hints sometimes misplaced about the brother-sister relationship. But it is not the case here. It is truly a pure and touching fraternal relationship as we see little.
Overall appreciation: 10/10
Kimetsu no Yaiba quickly became one of my favorite anime. Oh yes, nothing more.
I did not get bored for a second, and I was frustrated at the end of each episode because there was nothing next. Waiting a week each time was frustrating, and every episode delighted me. This anime really touched me, and I can not wait to see the next arc of the Ghost Train ! (although I have already read the manga!)
I also want to add my personal opinion on a subject: that of the fandom.
I find it strange that when you belong to a certain community, it necessarily forces you to disagree with other communities.
Everyone's opinion is purely personal and relatively subjective.
If someone tells me he does not like KnY, I'll be surprised, I'll try to find out why, but I will not force them to like this anime because I love it.
If someone does not agree with you, do not attack them by saying they are wrong. Do not denigrate them because they does not have the same tastes as you.
The same goes for rivalries and ""wars"" between communities: loving an anime does not prevent you from loving another, a ""rival"" anime.
If I like an anime, it's because of what it makes me feel. The emotions I feel watching it, its characters, its story, its music. But not what people or communities could dictate to me.
Of course, listening to advice and opinions is always something positive, but it's up to me and only me to judge what I should like or not.

Salut à tous, les amis, on se retrouve pour une nouvelle review et -/MUR/
Je tiens à rappeler que je n'écris que très rarement de reviews, donc forcément mon style et mon développement ne seront pas d'une qualité irréprochable, ne vous attendez pas à du Edgar Allan Poe
Quand j'ai entendu parler de Kimetsu no Yaiba la première fois, j'étais plutôt intrigué, et content, car j'étais encore en plein visionnage de Dororo et cette atmosphère de Japon ancien et de démons me plaisait énormément
Comme pour beaucoup d'animes saisonniers, je me suis renseigné au strict minimum, voire pas du tout, afin de ne rien me gâcher. Est-ce que je l'ai regretté ? Aucunement.
Mais trève de tergiversations, passons directement à la review.
Histoire : 8/10
Si l'on y regarde de plus près, l'histoire de Kimetsu no Yaiba n'a rien de vraiment spécial, ou unique. Elle est plutôt banale. Mais bonne, rafraîchissante et très agréable à suivre.
Si elle ne brille pas par sa complexité, ses dénouements ou sa profondeur, elle reste très appréciable.  Je ne me suis jamais retrouvé à pointer du doigt des erreurs scénaristiques, des incohérences ou même des problèmes de rythme. Bon, il faut dire que je suis très bon public. 
Je me suis laissé porter par l'histoire de Kimetsu no Yaiba, et ce fut un voyage particulièrement plaisant.
Art : 10/10
L'un des gros points forts de cet anime. 
Il y a tellement à dire...
Tout d'abord, les décors sont souvent très jolis, l'anime se passe en majeure partie en milieu rural ce qui permet de montrer de beaux paysages, souvent détaillés et sauvages. 
L'ambiance plus urbaine est très surprenante, car on parle ici du Japon du début du XXe siècle, un Japon qui entre dans la modernité mais encore profondément ancré dans ses traditions et sa ruralité. Le contraste entre la campagne et la ville est bluffant.
L'animation lors des combats est impeccable, rien à dire là-dessus. Bien évidemment, on pense tout de suite à l'épisode 19, mais chaque combat de cet anime a été magnifiquement animé. Le visuel des attaques de souffle est particulièrement beau. 
Enfin, bien sûr, parlons du CGI. 
Comme je l'ai déjà peut être dit dans une autre review, je suis TRES sensible au CGI dans les animes, et dans presque tous les cas, je le trouve moche et il nuit à mon appréciation. Kimetsu no Yaiba est l'un des rares animes où ce n'est pas le cas.
Le CGI est MAGNIFIQUE. Pas juste ""passable"" ou ""correct"", c'est vraiment beau. En plus, cela donne naissance à des scènes spectaculaires, comme le combat contre les démons aux flèches et aux ballons, ou plus récemment dans le dédale de Muzan façon Inception. 
Soundtrack : 10/10
L'autre point fort de cet anime. Tout d'abord, j'adore l'opening, c'est l'un de mes préférés tous animes confondus. L'ending lui aussi est très beau d'ailleurs, ce sont des points qui jouent beaucoup dans un anime.
Mais que dire de l'OST ? C'est l'une des meilleures que je n'ai jamais entendues ! L'association de musique orchestrale occidentale à de la musique traditionnelle japonaise est à la limite orgasmique pour les oreilles. Les musiques sont brillamment utilisées au fil de l'anime, et participent énormément à la création de toute cette ambiance si particulière qui émane continuellement de KnY. 
Personnages : 9/10
Que l'on se mette d'accord : les personnages de KnY n'ont pas une complexité hors du commun, comme c'est le cas pour certains animes. Pourtant, je les apprécie (tous) énormément. 
Les démons ont souvent une backstory intéressant et qui aide à compatir avec eux, sans pour autant partir dans du mélodramatique à la Naruto. 
Les piliers ont eux aussi une personnalité et une histoire intéressantes. Pour l'instant, on a seulement pu voir le parcours de Shinobu, mais ayant lu le manga et sans spoil, je peux simplement dire que les autres piliers sont pour la plupart extrêmement sympathiques et leurs histoires bien construites, elles aussi.
Il en va de même pour les autres personnages, parfois un peu plus secondaires, qui font preuve de sentiments admirables, et qui ne tombent jamais dans les comportements génériques et clichés.
Tanjiro, le protagoniste, est incroyablement agréable. On a un MC qui réfléchit, est raisonnable dans son jugement et ses décisions, et qui...est juste incroyablement humain. Il est très rare de voir un protagoniste de shonen faire preuve de compassion, une vertu pourtant primordiale pour un être humain. Cette compassion (qui n'est pas de la naïveté, attention) rend Tanjiro très agréable et attire toute la sympathie du spectateur.
Contrairement à ce que certains ressentent, j'apprécie beaucoup le personnage de Zenitsu. Oui, il crie beaucoup, oui, il est bruyant. Je comprends totalement qu'il puisse agacer bon nombre de personnes. Mais...ce n'est pas mon cas ! J'apprécie son rôle de comic relief.
Il en va de même pour Inosuke, qui en plus, a un développement intéressant au fur et à mesure qu'il passe du temps avec Tanjiro et Zenitsu.
Réfutez-le ou non, mais Inosuke est la meilleure waifu. 
Et, bien sûr, finissons avec le meilleur : Nezuko. J'ai rarement vu un personnage aussi adorable et en même temps aussi utile. Il aurait été facile de créer un personnage mignon mais bouche-trou, qui se contente de faire des trucs mignons. Mais ce n'est pas le cas de Nezuko, qui en plus d'être mignonne, va aller casser les bouches des méchants. 
Elle est déjà la source de nombreux memes sur Internet, et elle le mérite totalement. Praise Nezuko.
Je tiens aussi à rajouter que j'adore la relation qu'elle entretient avec son grand frère. Japon oblige, il aurait été à peine surprenant d'avoir des allusions parfois déplacées sur les relations entre frère et soeur. Mais ce n'est pas le cas ici. C'est vraiment une pure et touchante relation fraternelle comme on en voit peu.
Appréciation générale : 10/10
Kimetsu no Yaiba s'est très vite placé parmi mes animes favoris. Et oui, rien que ça.
Je ne me suis pas ennuyé une seule seconde, et j'ai été frustré à chaque fin d'épisode car il n'y avait plus rien ensuite. Attendre une semaine à chaque fois était frustrant, et chaque épisode me ravissait. Cet anime m'a vraiment touché, et j'ai hâte de voir le prochain arc du Train de l'Infini ! (même si j'ai déjà lu le manga !)
Je tiens aussi à placer mon avis personnel sur un sujet : celui du fandom. 
Je trouve ça étrange que, lorsque l'on appartient à une certaine communauté, cela nous oblige forcément à être en désaccord avec d'autres communautés.
L'avis d'un chacun est purement personnel et relativement subjectif. 
Si quelqu'un me dit qu'il n'aime pas KnY, je vais être surpris, je chercherai à savoir pourquoi, mais je ne le forcerai pas à aimer cet anime, sous prétexte que je l'aime moi. 
Si quelqu'un n'est pas d'accord avec vous, n'allez pas l'agresser en disant qu'il a tort. Ne le dénigrez pas parce qu'il n'a pas les mêmes goûts que vous. 
Il en va de même pour les rivalités et les ""guerres"" entre communautés : aimer un anime ne vous empêche pas d'en aimer un autre, un ""rival"".
Si j'aime un anime, c'est pour ce qu'il réveille en moi. Les émotions que je ressens en le regardant, ses personnages, son histoire, sa musique. Mais pas ce que pourraient me dicter des personnes ou des communautés. 
Bien sûr, écouter des conseils et des avis est toujours quelque chose de positif, mais c'est à moi seul de juger ce que j'aime ou non.",10,Damuzen

                Kimetsu no Yaiba, the manga drawn and written by Koyoharu Gotouge, has broken sales records since Ufotable handled his adaptation.
The plot easily places us in context and pre-establishes what the rest of the story will be, approximately. The popularity of such anime can generate a contrary expectation or it can misplace people making them think that it is about an indisputably perfect story, hence many disappointments and people saying that such is overrated. Although his story is not perfect and may have subjectivity conflicts with comedy and / or clumsiness that break the immersion; Kimetsu no Yaiba triumphs by letting you know in advance, with
                  a generic plot, that his adventure scales all the predictable peaks of Shonen and tales of revenge. What do I want to get to ?: Kimetu no Yaiba, before his story begins, explains that it is not a mixed and creative Shonen, but for the most temporary and nescient entertainment you can have. Nor do I say that the work depends on the ignorance of the interpreter, but that, like all existing authentic stories, it depends on a correct idea so that it is not seen from an inadvisable angle.
I know here I am already delivering a stupid reputation by saying that its story is authentic when it is an anime popularly criticized for being generic. Let me explain my point first. If Kimetsu no Yaiba is popularly criticized for being generic, then it is not generic, but genuinely generic. It has scattered components of the power levels and abilities that try to be unique to avoid a plagiarism drama, however, Ufotable has an important role here and, that role, is to make a story almost empty of shock have remarkable and appreciable moments. This anime does not give all its essence through its story, but through the fireworks that color the clear black sky with colors that make it a memorable experience.
The story, before the main factor, is the contributing factor so that the animation and soundtrack studio have the necessary pillars for an explosion of shocking moments to take place. If you remember Yuru Camp or Angel's Egg, you are immediately remembering animes that may have flaws or a decent story at most, but whose production turns it into works of art that try to catch the viewer so that, at the same time, they can witness a story coherent.
The concept is basic, it shows the demons in their most natural behavior, excluding Nezuko, who is the protagonist's sister. It stands to reason, by human instinct, that demons are evil and humans are weak in relative strength and can even exhibit supernatural powers. Again, Kimetsu no Yaiba delivers concepts understandable to the naked eye to make it an easily digestible experience. Just by reading his plot and understanding the charismatic personality of Tanjiro, the author takes us into an experience where we already differentiate good from evil and, with this, we already have full confidence in the victorious end of its protagonist. This is not an error nor is it a defect; Besides, the only thing that should matter to us in such a story is not the beginning or the end, as I said before, it is an important factor so that the viewer does not enter with lateral expectations.
If we talk about the story and its general structure, it follows the structure of a conventional Shonen distributed by arcs that go from weak opponents to the greatest final enemy, progressing and concluding in a possible climax. Kimetu no Yaiba follows this same structure throughout the season and possibly all 207 chapters of the manga. Here, what makes Kimetsu no Yaiba more exceptional is his evolutionary rhythm, adding new characters and showing us the origin of their behaviors. While personalities may feel illogical at first, characters are not given depth at the wrong times. Every character has his flashback moment and, after exploring the memories of him, we regain consciousness and he surprises us with a good final development. And while characters like Zenitsu have this illogical complex in their expectations, other characters will be introduced in more serious and grim ways with unique characteristics that will pique your interest before their flashback moment.
After a battle, the conclusion does not feel victorious, but rather like a dark adventure where each character is moved against the grain by an obligation of revenge and permanence, there is no thirst for lust staining the objectives of each character. And, what's more, here not even the viewer is able to capture a feeling of triumph, since we are shown the past of the demons who want to face the main cast. It is not a fight in which you wish to the death the victory of a character, but rather goes on a more genuine path and chooses to make you feel the desire that each one does not run into a destiny stained with tragedy.
Now if we talk about this anime in general, it is one that is worth watching or at least giving it a try. I am aware that it has things that could divert some people, so your enjoyment with this one is not guaranteed, but if you want to be amazed with a brutal production and outstanding moments, this is the first one that I would recommend.",10,EyeViewer

                Hippity hippity Demon Slayer lacks titties, and I'm fine with that. 
It's been ages since the day Kimetsu no Yaiba exploded, and people worldwide got blown away by what this anime can offer. After finally having the time to catch up to observe what made its potential bloom, I can say this anime deserves the recognition it deserves.
Plot-wise, it's nothing revolutionary nor narrates complex writing of any sort, but rather, it simply tells the story of our protagonist, Tanjiro, in his typical Shonen adventure to seek answers and revenge for his family that got annihilated by some Demon ('tis not a spoiler though, it's literally
                  the summary so don't fret ). It follows the same formula for almost all anime belonging to the shonen genre, but like many good shonen anime's out there, they executed it well, seriously. There's a starting point, a wise old man, grinding arc, existential crisis arc, death of friends arc, and of course, the unbeatable plot armor that continues to shield our beloved shonen protagonists from the misery they ought to face in their journey. And while it sticks to that cliche formula, they've carried it out well that I've no grudge against them, because it's that good.
I've got nothing to say for the soundtracks except it made my ears cum to the banger OP that I guess to anyone reading this, probably heard. But it's not only the opening that deserves the grace it receives, but I'd like to point out the fitting scores that captures the overall tone of the scene, thus brought me for a much more immersive experience. Though I guess what made my view on the soundtracks much more on the positive side is that the scores DURING the fight scenes are truly incredible, I unconsciously left my jaw-dropping for a moment there. 
The animators however, unlike many generic anime's out there, simply didn't hold their crotches and instead focused on drawing every little detail and movement while animating each frame. I caught up late on this anime but I can still say the visuals are magnificent enough to make its popularity rise above the heavens and attract new preys to this bizarre anime community. Knowing the studio behind this is Ufotable, you can clear any anxieties regarding lazy animation of any sort, as they're known to throw away budget like there's no tomorrow. 
But I guess what I truly liked about Demon Slayer is that its approach to villains, is new to my perspective. Instead of just continuing the episode after defeating a villain to proceed to the next arc, Demon Slayer merely reveals each demon's background, some having unique and impactful history, and some are mediocre enough for me to forget, but when the meaningful lore shows, goddamn it hits right in the feels. And I like it; I like how the villains, even with cruel desires, have a past of their own to explain their present actions. This approach, for me personally, is what made Demon Slayer a good anime for me, even with all the flaws and generic bullshit the author proceeded to insert. I usually sympathize with the villains I see as long as they have a meaningful and relevant background to justify their actions, and Demon Slayer somehow captured my sympathy with their villains.
Fanservice is uhmmm...few or close to none. The only fanservice you get is from our protagonist's little sister, and that's terribly adorable alright. I did find myself smirking from the noises (no lewd intention ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) the little sister makes, but hey, she's really cute ya know. 
So anyways, I see that many diehard anime fans shit on this anime for being overrated and lacking in aspects many underappreciated anime's have, and I don't give the slightest damn about that and you shouldn't too. It's really not an anime with deep storytelling nor life-changing wisdom to teach you, but if you're a casual anime watcher like me or even a newbie in the field of anime, then feel free to give this a try and have your virginity taken by Demon Slayer as you begin your journey to explore many more anime's out there in the future.",9,Akira_Habane

                This is my first review, so it may not be the best! Thank you for looking at it, though!
I love Demon Slayer. I am one of those freaks who has a Top 10 Anime list, and Demon Slayer falls squarely at #7. Demon Slayer pulled me in, enchanted me, enthralled me, made me emotional, and completely captured my heart.
The thing is, I can't figure out how it did it.
In writing this review, I am asking myself, ""What makes this anime so special?"" ""How did it rise above and dethrone Rising of the Shield Hero as #7 in your list?"" ""Why do you think everyone under
                  the sun should give this anime a chance?"" I sincerely don't know the answers to these questions, but I'm going to take a crack at it.
Demon Slayer is a quintessential shounen anime. Right down to its core, it is shounen. Male protagonist with troubled past? Check. Said protagonist starts off weak but gets the hang of it with the help of antagonistic—but generally good-natured—rivals? Check. Band of merry friends who cause as much trouble as they do solve? Check. Mysterious, absent father figure? Check. Characters who have specific fighting styles that are generally based around an element and have attack names that fit that element? Check. Long strings of minor villians that serve to solidify—but sometimes raise questions about—the protagonist's beliefs? Check. ...Imperialistic symbols? ...Check... God, I'm honestly wracking my brain, trying to think of more shounen tropes. The point is that this anime is a shounen, and not a super original one.
Maybe the familiarity of this show is what made me love it? Despite Demon Slayer's lack of originality, it executes (heh) its genre with finesse. This anime is nothing that I haven't seen before, but it all feels so fresh and new. I do have to say, though—Meiji-Era Japan makes for a wonderful backdrop, especially when the protagonist enters a big city for the first time. The stark contrast between rural and urban is something you experience at the same time as the other characters, and it makes you feel very out-of-place.
I also have to praise the characters. It feels like every single character is fleshed out in some way—even the minor villians. Everyone gets a story, and everyone's story has a resolution. In addition, I love that the protagonist's kindness is never a weakness. The protagonist treats everyone around him with respect, even if he's fighting against them. He realizes that even demons have a past, and he's attentive to what may be important to them. My favourite example of this is when he avoids stepping on paper that's scattered on the floor, because it may be part of his adversary's most precious memories. He sees good in everyone, but he never allows that to be a crutch. He knows what his job is, and he always gets that job done without resorting to cruelty.
Was it really just the characters that made me fall in love with Demon Slayer? I honestly don't know. I feel like there is so much to love about this anime, but I not sure how to put it into words. It's really special.
With that, I will end this review by thanking you for taking the time to read it. I really appreciate it!",10,ladymoonbeam

                This has to be one of my favorite animes, from the characters to the story and of course, the animation is top class as LITERALLY like to point out first. Despite the typical stereotype that only the animation of the anime is good is far beyond the truth. People like to point out the fact that the story is average but sometimes an average story is all you need. The characters are all loveable (especially zenitsu) and the power system is amazing, well I mean it is breathing, but it is still nice especially the variety of the attacks. The sound is dynamic and matches
                  the attack, emotion, and scene perfectly. I'll say that overall the anime is enjoyable if you don't like super complex animes or romcoms.",10,RadiateJam

                Demon Slayer is considered to be one of the best anime out there currently, and I personally find that statement to be true. Obviously it doesn't compare to things such as Naruto or One Piece, but it hooks you in from the beginning just as easily. 
Let's talk story.. I personally love following the plot of Demon Slayer (I even went out and bought the manga to continue following Tanjiro and his companions). While the story isn't exactly top notch, it's a solid 7/10. ""The show has a bad plot, carried by art."" is a statement I hear quite a bit; I find that statement
                  to be heavily untrue. The plot following Tanjiro and his need for revenge against Muzan is good overall, and you can see how it makes Tanjiro develop as a character. 
From an art perspective, this anime is absolutely phenomenal. The visuals are absolutely amazing; from the snow falling, to the blood splashing. Everything about this art is absolutely amazing, I have 0 complaints. 
Sound from the OST would be an 8/10 from me, but the voice acting (sub) carried it to a 10. I can feel the emotion in every scream, cry, laugh etc. I haven't felt emotion like that in many shows, and this one gave me that amazing feeling.
Enjoyment is more of a personal thing, but I gave it a 10/10 as I was hooked the entire time. I never felt a truly dull moment.
Overall this is a 9/10. It has its flaws, but every anime does. It's definitely worth a watch, as I feel this anime will genuinely be the next HUGE thing.",9,LilKanyeV2

*very minor spoilers*
Love it or hate it demon slayer is surely of the best animangas out there.
The anime community has seen a large discourse surrounding demon slayer on one side we see people claiming animation carries on another we see people falling in love with the characters and stories and when i look at it demon slayer has outstanding writing.
tanjiro is a character who's life is completely forced to turned upside down by pure coincidence and is left alone with noone but his demon sister many of you know the story already so there is no need to give a further explanation on it but
                  many will claim this is a very generic or basic story which i highly have to disagree too because this does not take the basic shonen formula many other shows take such as wanting to be the best or strongest etc;

When i hear people talking about the story and how they don't like it i think they are getting confused on what they are trying to say because for story demon slayer is very easy to understand and straight foward there is no waiting for 3 seasons to make some progression there is no keeping up with timelines or getting confused by so called complexity of a story that is not the case in demon slayer the story is very easy and simple and just cause is easy to understand by no means does it make it bad in fact it actually makes it good because it is something everyone can understand and enjoy the story is a solid 9-10/10
story progression
the story progression is something very nice in demon slayer in times it can be slow but im really of fan of that because you get the feel of how hard the journey to becoming a demon slayer for tanjro was it took him quite along time to be prepared to fight demons and even then it was still hard over all the story progresses nicely as tanjiro encounter stronger demons and meets new people who have all suffered in the world they live in the over all flow of demon slayer is extraordinary 8-9/10 
protagonist 
tanjiro is a beautiful protagonist and his ideals are something so well suited for the story. One instance in particular that i really like about his character is how his ideals are confronted and the thing is tanjiro has hope that his ideals will come through and we see this when he makes the deal to kill himself if nezuko ever kills a human but its not just this tanjiro's ideal can exist with others that aren't as similar for example most of the hashira hate demons and don't sympathize with them but thats ok because wether or not tanjiro or the hashira and other demon slayers sympathize witht he demons they will still make sure to kill them tanjiro's kindness is just a bonus he was able to receive by having a demon sister which makes his ideals nice to look at.10/10
side characters
all the side characters are very unique and i like that about demon slayer not just the slayers themselves but the demons too pretty much about everyone in demon slayer has a back story and like that alot because the backstories are all very different with some similarities of course however the backstories are really nice because it helps create the notion that everyone came from somewhere for example my favorite demon being rui was someone who just wanted to have a family because he thought his human family didn't love him even tho they did , regardless of their acceptance to his fragile body he felt he still needed a healthy one but it turned out bad and created his life to spiral downwards the backstories really help humanize the characters and add a lot of relatability to the story with real life implication of course someone irl isn't going to become some human eating monster but the need to be better is something very prevalent but even further the thought of needing to be better regardless of wether you are accepted or not is a nice story to represent and this is true for about 99% of demon slayer characters. the characters are by far my favorite part of demon slayer as they are very touching and its emotional impact is something amazing the comedy from characters like inosuke and zenitsu always feels right and necessary to lighten up the mood before a tragedy 10+/10
enjoyment 
this was so amazing to watch i feel like i could watch it over a million times and never get bored of it in fact i've watched it 3 times already 10+/10  
animation
the animation you already know is phenomenal by no means does this carry demon slayer at all but it is a nice bonus for such a masterpiece 10/10
ost
again its beautiful and such a bonus for a masterpiece 10/10
tl;dr demon slayer excels at characters which is why this is so good on par with many bonuses like good animation and ost  and will surely become a classic in decades to come",10,Ivanh0571

                Once again ufotable proving they are the absolute GOAT.
Anything that this studio touches with their unlimited budget works literally ends up being a masterpiece. Demon Slayer:Kimetsu no Yaiba is no exception. An absolute breathtaking journey into the world of Taisho Period Japan, with a twist. The lands are infested with man eating demons which the demon slayers (a group of elite fighters specially trained to kill demons using blades infused with special material) are then sent to dispose of. This story centers around an innocent Tanjiro who comes back home one day to find out his whole family has been brutally slaughtered, except for his
                  little sister Nezuko. He later finds out she has been turned into the very thing that killed his family, however she still has a tiny sense of herself and who she really is, hence protecting and accompanying her older brother in search of a way to turn her back into a human. A simple story sure, but one that is done very well and is very enjoyable to watch.
The blend of 3DCGI and 2D animation (something that ufotable is second to none at) is immaculate, especially for the breathing techniques. This is the same studio that did the Fate/stay Night and Fate/Zero series so of course the animation and fight scenes are world class. The colours used are so bright and vivid, breathing life into the beauty of Japan with its references to folklore such as Urokodaki's tengu mask and the gorgeous purple of the wisteria flowers.
Ep.19 was one of the greatest episodes of anime I have ever had the privilege of consuming. The animation and visuals were just eye-candy and the OST fit perfectly with the emotions brewing within Tanjiro throughout the series and in that particular moment. It left me literally breathless as i sat back for 20 minutes staring at the ceiling contemplating the beauty i just witnessed. 
The score is just as good as the animation, with LiSA blessing our ears with the opening theme and a solid set of OST's by the wonderful Yuki Kajiura. What really stood out was the OST during Ep.19 titled ""Kamado Tanjiro no Uta"". Perfect for the scene with lyrics directly relating to Tanjiro and his journey through the darkness with no choice but to keep pressing onward.
The main cast of characters are really enjoyable to watch, especially the trio of Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke with some really hilarious moments and scenes. The design of the pillars are amazing, you can tell how intense and poweful they are from just looking at them. 
Thank you ufotable for this gorgeous series, いただきます.

                If you've seen episode 19, you know.
This shit is BRILLIANT. So smooth, so colorful, so dynamic and powerful. The music, the sound effects, the way everything builds and builds into a jaw-dropping tsunami of an episode. And to think that this isn’t even the last?! Somehow, I know they’re going to top this, as crazy as that seems—but let’s be real, this series has been getting better every episode so I can't imagine that will change.
Animation, cinematography, sound designs, everything is woven together perfectly. The animation in particular is unbelievable—it's the most beautiful I've ever seen, even compared to the likes of Bones' Mob Psycho
                  or even ufotable's own Fate Series.
The fights have a dynamism that's hard to explain, a kind of movement and vigor that transports you from your surroundings into the adrenaline, a whirlwind of pulse-pounding energy that does NOT let you go. It's incredible. Not many shows can ""electrify"" you. You know the feeling. It sets in slowly, a kind of soft flicker of ""wow, this is good"" that swells into a roaring fire of ""holy fuck, I'll never be able to watch a fight scene again"". Well, here you go. I just made your life easier.
I'll say it again. 
This shit was brilliant.

                This is how you make the best out of a mediocre genre. Shounen is known for its predictable overblown action, generic this generic that. But this show takes those generic action scenes and fucking CAAAHPLOYIES it to the moon. Every action scene is engaging, enjoying every second until its conclusion. Pair that with the stunning illustrations and sound design and you got yourself peak action scenes. 
I've seen how people say the story and characters are nothing special to note about but I would disagree and say that while yes they aren't the best, but they certainly are not generic. The only characters I could
                  agree with being generic is ramen boy and boar bog even then I would say they play the best generic roll ive seen as there are sprinkles of uniqueness in their backstory or mental situation. Which makes them compelling and goes past the stereotypes you see in other animes. The story is honestly a fresh take to me, and the encounters they face along the way and believable and charming. Is that training arc was everything you could ever want a training arc to be. The development of character and body mixed with the motivation to compel and IMPROVE! 
To my mind there really isn't any negatives other than at times the cgi looking wonky and that there was minor moments that fell flat. but otherwise flawless anime in my eyes. Based Face Expressions/10",10,IceploxtheOG

                I only finished this a month after it ended, so I understand I'm very late to the party. Nevertheless, although I don't write reviews, I felt strangely compelled to write one for this. 
It appears baffling to me that many have passed Kimetsu no Yaiba off as a show with insipid writing and poor characters, with phenomenal animation as its only saving grace. Beyond the bloodshed, Kimetsu no Yaiba is a story of morality. Throughout the story, we see a recurring motif of empathy, often through the actions of Tanjiro, our protagonist.
It is the Taisho era, Japan. Tanjiro and his family dwell rurally in the
                  mountain, selling coal and wood to make ends meet. For reasons untold, the family live sequestered from others, save for other eccentric dwellers and a small village by the foot of the mountain. They are impoverished. Life is weary and full of graft, and yet, they are happy. 
Tanjiro is presented concretely — a person of impeccable rectitude, benevolent to a fault; he works industriously as the breadwinner of his family (despite his young age) and supports his mother in raising his younger siblings. He does favours for everyone in the village freely, and splits hairs over the most minor transactions, insisting on paying even if what he has is meager. He is liked by everyone, and disliked by no one. 
But happiness is transient, and disaster strikes when Tanjiro descends the mountain one day and fails to return in time. He survives only with the aid of Giyuu, a demon slayer, who berates him for his obsequiousness and helplessness. The encounter is seminal: it impresses on Tanjiro the need for strength and Giyuu the chance for something different. Giyuu is cynical, jaded. It is clear that he has seen too much in his vocation as a demon slayer, but he recommends Tanjiro to his former teacher, trusting his instinct. 
'...the first human every demon kills is itself.'
So enters Tanjiro, demon slayer with sword in hand and demon in tow. His very existence is paradoxical, but curiously, this antinomy allows Tanjiro to empathise with even the worst demons. Far more than pity, Tanjiro dignifies them in their final moments of quietus. He humanises them. 
'...they're not hideous monsters at all. Demons are hopeless creatures. They are tragic creatures!'
Even shambling monstrosities who have committed deplorable atrocities seem to be no exception. When they are first presented, they appear reprehensible, and the furthest thing from a human. But as the fight progresses, tinctures of the whole picture are revealed. As the demons regain a hazy sense of human lucidity before their death, the curtains are dropped and the full picture is laid bare. A raddled writer. A confused child. The desire for human warmth, the abnegation, the stinging regret. A human connection. 
Make no mistake, Tanjiro understands that these demons cannot be forgiven for their deeds. When it comes down to it, he is perfectly willing to unsheathe his steel. The duality of his character is well-articulated and fleshed out. 
Kimetsu no Yaiba was nothing short of a masterpiece. The art, animation and music elevated it to meteoric heights, but the real coping stone, to me, was the characters and the way they were developed. Moral themes and comedy are deftly interwoven into the story alongside passionate action scenes.

                Kimetsu no Yaiba/Demon Slayer: I loved it! 
PLEASE NOTE: I'm not new to the shounen scene at all, however I do tend to prefer things like romance and comedy, so I'm about 90% qualified to leave a review. Keep that in mind!
Story: 9 - Cause it was kinda generic. Never seen before...but also generic. But did I like it? Hell yeah! Only one point off because I'm not gonna be a hypocrite.
Art: 10 - Great lighting aesthetic, and the colors managed to be so dark yet VIBRANT!
Sound: 10 - I watched with a surround sound system, and oh boy, that was bone chilling!!!
Character: 9 -
                  Point off for ""GeNeRiCnEsS"" with some of the characters (you're gonna hear that a lot). I understand that shounen sees that their fans like the ""with the power of [insert something, preferably friends, family, or strength], I will become very overpowered!!!"" and kinda milk it for that reason, but like I said earlier, I'm missing 10% of ""qualified"", so I'll sorta let it slide...
Enjoyment: 10 - I had a blast watching this series. Sure, there are a few flaws, but overall, it was so fun to watch. I also give this a 10 because of how much/often I had to force myself to watch it: never! I didn't have to force a second of watching!
Overall: 9 - I liked this series a lot because of the clear amount of creativity and effort put in, but it did have things that made me take a point off.
Watch this series if you like shounen, action, fighting, and bright colors.
Don't watch if you like no plot/story, slow and easygoing, and something TOTALLY new. I will also say that this anime should not be your first; it will set your expectations kind of high.",9,gengrie

                Demon Slayer knows exactly what kind of story it wants to be, and does so extremely well, but does its reliance on certain narrative crutches make for “bad writing?”
Most reviewers agree that the sound, animation, and overall presentation of Demon Slayer is excellent, but the writing is more divisive. That’s why this review is completely dedicated to the story. 
One of the most important questions to ask when judging the writing of a story is: “What is it trying to do, and does it do that well?” While Demon Slayer might not be breaking your expectations for the action-shounen genre, it achieves its purpose incredibly
                  well and makes for a wonderfully entertaining story, as long as you can put up with some unrealistic interactions and sudden developments. 
|| Focus 10/10 ~ Masterful ||
The first 15 seconds of Demon Slayer explain almost the entire premise: This is the story of how Tanjirou will save his sister. Most of the story elements contribute to narrating Tanjirou and Nezuko’s journey as they train in body and spirit as they grow to understand and pity the demons they fight, so the story never loses its path towards that goal. 
✓ Everything supports the story’s goals and themes
✓ Elevates a simple premise into an engaging plot
✓ Utilizes a fairly small cast of characters to great effect
✓ Characters consistently feel important to story events. 
✓ No hot springs or beach episodes
✓ No filler
|| Ambition 7/10 ~ Good ||
Demon Slayer avoids the worst tropes of the Shonen genre and even has a few innovations, but at the end of the day it’s still the simplistic plot you would expect from an action-shounen story, though that isn’t inherently bad.
I can’t express enough how much I enjoy the cooperation in Demon Slayer’s fights. There’s a few exceptions, but most of the time our heroes have to work together, protect one another, and create weaknesses for their comrades to exploit when against tough opponents. 
✓ Actual cooperation in battles
✓ Fantasy mechanics feel consistent despite little development
✓ Story progresses incredibly quick for its genre, making up for the simplistic plot
✘ Mechanics are so simple that you have to just accept them and move on
✘ Plot has little intricacy
✘ Par for the course in action-shounen
|| Dialogue 6/10 ~ Fine ||
✓ Efficient in developing characters
✓ Moves story along quickly
✓ Concise, leaves more room for other things
✘ Unrealistic conversations
✘ Nezuko’s name is shouted too often
✘ Awkward dialogue during fights
✘ Characters frequently react with vapid/pointless questions. (Asking a question even though the answer is obvious, e.g. “are you awake?”)
Tanjirou has a tendency to ask unnecessary questions as a way of keeping the conversation moving down a fixed path and pointing out important details to the reader. An example of this is how Tanjirou and others will point out obvious things during fights (“Oh no, my hair is wrapped around the axe!”, which isn’t abnormal for action shounen, but isn’t a necessary crutch when the animation is good enough to show it just fine. This is normal for its genre and isn't necessarily bad, but can be annoying.
|| Structure 10/10 ~ Masterful ||
Demon Slayer hones and sharpens the tropes of its genre, proving that some tropes exist for a reason and aren’t inherently bad for their stories.
✓ Humble beginnings create a great sense of progression
✓ Every encounter develops the world
✓ Fight structures are less predictable than others in genre
✓ Characters and plot elements introduced slowly at first to build mystery
✓ Villains backstories don’t interrupt fights, makes them harder to predict and matches emotional fallout
|| Overall 8.25/10 ~ Great writing ||
Most of the ‘flaws’ in Demon Slayer’s writing may seem like bad writing when isolated from their context, but when I ask myself: “Would changing that make the story better?” The answer is usually “No.” Sure, I would care more about the villains if they received character development before they were already dying, but that would interrupt the pacing of the fights. By doing it consistently, KnY teaches you to expect the villains to be the “tragic, pitiful creatures” that Tanjirou sees them to be, and reminds you of that in the wake of every victory, which is where your emotions are most vulnerable.
Sure, when characters point out obvious details in fights it goes against “show don’t tell.” But they also focus the action on the most important events and those thoughts anchor us to the characters’ perspectives and make the fight immersive. Even though such a thing isn’t realistic, it makes for a much better story. The series clearly displays a talent for “show don’t tell” through how it develops its characters through details, behaviors, and design, but that’s a separate discussion entirely. How much people like Shinobu despite a relatively small amount of screentime should be a testament for the series’ writing philosophy.
While it may seem confusing that Nezuko is gagged and unable to talk whereas the other demons converse freely, the symbolism of the bamboo muzzle as a thematic comparison to a Buddhist monk’s vow of silence, as well as her unique condition make her to be a strong character in her own right whose muteness is a reminder of the struggle to retain her humanity. Sure, it’s a plot device to keep the focus on Tanjirou as the protagonist, but it makes the story better.
Finally, while there are instances where Tanjirou suddenly gains a new ability, but they’re forgivable because if we knew he had them before, they would be the Chekhov’s gun and make the fight more predictable. There’s more enjoyment to be gained in a story by having this character growth frequently come in during fights, instead of always during long training arcs, even if that was more realistic. Demon Slayer makes this growth canon, as well as thematic, with the expression of how near-death experiences pull at your long-forgotten memories. Thematically, this enhances the frequent connection between memories and one’s humanity that makes all the flashbacks in the series more meaningful. 
In conclusion:
If you’re going into Demon Slayer expecting novel-quality writing or don’t like the action-shounen genre at all, you’re going to be disappointed. However, if you like the type of story the genre is capable of telling but can’t get into them because of their cliches and slow pacing, then Demon Slayer will almost definitely impress. It avoids cliches, leans into its tropes, and crafts a gripping story from fairly simple-seeming characters.  Due to how well its apparent flaws actually enhance the story’s focus, I would say that Demon Slayer has flawed but still excellent writing because of how it tells Tanjirou’s story in the most entertaining way possible.

                This might contain some spoilers, 
I’ve always had a bad habit to procrastinate doing many things, but I solely believe that this habit, in particular, is what enables me to enjoy a piece of content to the best of its capacity.
And the highly acclaimed title Kimetsu no Yaiba – Demon Slayer (it’s better-known counterpart) is no exception. I knew it was great, having watched snippets of its epic scenes on YouTube I was convinced that this would be one of the better series to close out the decade of 2010-2020. But it was only after starting to set aside the time to binge the series
                  did I understand why the popularity of this anime is so tremendous. Just like Shingeki no Kyojin, its popularity is justified. Simply being, SNK was great due to its originality and world-building. KNY (Kimetsu no Yaiba) shines in its amazing cast of characters and their backgrounds where the entirety of the narrative revolves around the characters which they feature. Both with a different focus and yet they’re both great masterpieces in their own right. Some might say that the writing for this anime is poorly done, but to be fair if you’re able to see things from the author’s point of view or perhaps obtain a workaround on viewing things from a perspective other than your own. Maybe then you could understand why this anime is such a masterpiece.
Now let’s get started with an actual review of this great anime known as Demon Slayer. As a writer, how would you know if you’ve made an impression on your audience, at the very first episode no less? That’s right, you start by kicking them straight in feels, playing everything out as a happy go lucky type of setting just to be thrown into the shit moments after. Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t the recipe for success but the way the author made the setting complemented the theme so well that it felt second nature to the series as a whole. The first episode alone is enough to send shivers down your spine because of its implicit and no-nonsense approach. The foreshadowing and tease from the extras was merely the start of what the audience can expect.”The great calm before a mighty storm” and the writer delivered this marvellously.
But every story has to start somewhere and the writer wasted no time planting a convenient yet effective method, the main character and his family but what can the writer do to ensure that the protagonists continue their journey relentlessly? That’s right, by instating a purpose and a raison d’etre to ensure that there is an end goal to meet alongside the expectation of something more or rather to the light at the end of the tunnel. Now to begin, the main theme of this show is actually familial warmth and the bonds we share as individuals living together. Whether we like it or not, we cannot choose nor can we change how other people act but we can change ourselves for the better. Be it love for oneself or love for another, the author is able to pen down her thoughts rather effectively and trigger the tender heartstrings of her audiences well. And make no mistake, this isn’t your typical Nakama Power nonsense. People often joke about how Naruto uses Talk no Jutsu (it has become a full-fledged meme at this point) well guess what, the Main Character in this series exploits the power of his mind to overcome the many obstacles ahead.
Maybe the author herself understands that everything within us as humans are only limited by ourselves. The mind is a very powerful tool and what limits us is our very own thoughts and expectations, when we remove what we could potentially accomplish or cannot do we are setting an expectation over an intended result. But this is different when we just ignore our limiters to attempt something rather than just thinking. This itself is a dangerous thought but the results may at times surprise you. This is interesting because of how real this actually is. If the people in our current era forsake the thought of what if I fail and ignore the cannot’s and just focus on the do’s we’d get far more results and greater successes. That is quite frankly how our Main Character is able to push forward even when the odds are stacked so ridiculously against him. The bonds that he shares are just that much stronger than the forces opposing him. The human mind is able to overcome the most impossible of odds when faced with a life and death situation. Our desperate attempts to stay alive is the depiction of the last vestiges of our existence, it is what causes strange phenomenons to take form which again highlights our greatest attribute as human beings. “Our ability to adapt.”
Humans are weak, that is why we band together to form communities. It is an undeniable fact as shown through our history. It is essential for our survival, in this show the demon counterparts are the representation of strength the direct opposite of weakness. Which is why they seek to work alone and be solitary. (This is further explored on in potential seasons/manga) (but we will not touch on that here)
The genius in Kyoharu Goutoge’s narrative is that she is able to create characters with relatable stories and backgrounds which in turn causes the audience to sympathise and empathise with. In turn, it also depicts that everyone has a lot in life, and not all are blessed that is why we humans are ‘Unequal’. When we are born, we just have to accept what we are given and live with it. Do not complain that the rules are unfair because nothing in this world is. And Kyoharu’s writing will ease this concept into the very depths of your mind as you watch the series moving forward.
From the very first episode, everything is thrown into a spiral and thus our Protagonist begins on his arduous journey in a venture of something that is quite possibly impossible. The story alone is very touching and heart-wrenching, it is almost as if the writer herself has been part of such tragedies and or rather is exposed/made known to them. She is able to find a purpose to reason and justify why bad things happen, a factor, a situation, everything in constant, one final outcome. Everything happens for a reason but why do things turn out differently when the same situation is pitted amongst others? Because every individual is different, we all have our own problems and we face them differently. This show does a damn good job in depicting this.
The story starts out in a very fluid way, every episode covers important aspects for the plot to progress. For how dark this show actually is, the writer incorporates light-humour to offset the extreme negative feelings brought about by the show as it moves forward. One of the main highlights of why Kimetsu no Yaiba is such a masterpiece is that the writer has an absurd cast of characters and for her to come up with background stories for almost every one of them is mindblowing. Every villain in the series has a background story, not sure if this was the writer’s intention to justify why people do bad things. But everyone has to start somewhere and bad things can happen to anyone.
It is more of how we cope with them moving forward. Kyoharu utilises the transition between her narrative well, from action into recovery and into world-building. I would say that this is a recipe for success, given that the series never felt boring even for a second. It was extremely engaging, not to mention hilarious given the side characters interactions depicted a touch of humanity in a world where demons roam it helps to have these short bits of comedy to keep things light. It refreshes the audience’s mood for what is to come next. I am unable to delve much into the story without spoiling it but the narrative is written in such a way that people behave in such a way that they do is mainly due to the circumstances that they are in. We do not choose to be where we are but we can choose to become who we want to be.
The art in this anime is simply mind-boggling, it felt as though they had the budget to create another season of attack on titan. Imagine a series rivalling an anime that is arguably going to be the anime of the decade. That alone is pretty insane, the attention to details for the characters, environment and effects is simply outstanding. It wouldn’t be exaggerating to say that this anime could potentially be the next Shingeki no Kyojin. Although the tone and approach are different its popularity is undeniable, the music is well done and quite simply extremely fitting for the tone and setting of this anime. It is unsettling when it needs to be, light-hearted when required and epic when needed. The openings and ending are sung by LiSA nuff said. Not to mention the character song that is played when one of the epic fights occurred no wonder the author herself cried, it was really one of the “Caption Moments in Anime History.”
Needless to say, I freaking enjoyed this anime, I mean I can totally see myself rewatching this again and again without ever feeling bored or unimpressed. It is just that good, the characters are very interesting each and every one of them provides a different perspective and there is always more than what meets the eye. If you’ve not seen the background story for that character, don’t sell them short it isn’t because they don’t have one. It is just that they haven’t gotten their chance to showcase it. When you have the audience loving not just the main characters but the side characters you know you’ve got a great piece of work here. BUT to go a step further, to make your audience empathise and like even the antagonists now that is awe-inspiring. It isn’t easy to create likeable characters and Kyoharu is able to imagine and create an assembly of likeable casts left and right. It almost feels like it is second nature to her, it is simply astounding. When you’re exposed to content like this, you know that you’ve got a binge-worthy series on your hands. Given how this anime takes no chill to another level, you will always be on a roller coaster of emotions.
In terms of its depth, there are many things that can be learnt from this anime but let us cover a few that Kyoharu has so graciously outlined for us the audience. Good and bad, are two sides of the same coin, how can we determine which is right from wrong? Who gets to decide that? The fact remains that we as individuals dictate what we should think and how we should feel, not based on what people tell us. It is true that the strong get to decide what happens and the weak can only cower in fear if they refuse to fight back. Because if you don’t try you will never know if you could have done something differently or made a difference in your situation. At times when the forces against us are so overwhelming that we start to despair, it is easy to let the fear settle in and cloud our judgement it is only until much later that we regret our actions and start to realise the folly of our decision. But once you’ve made a mistake does that mean that you’re forever lost? Is there no chance of redemption?
No, there is always a turning point but you must be brave enough to take the first step. Because at the end of the day, it is us and only us who can change ourselves to rely on others to do it for us is simply pathetic. Because even when it succeeds the results are not borne through your individual efforts it was forced out of you by another. Can you truly say that you lived that life? Or rather did what you wanted to? To live without regrets, one must first believe that within themselves on what they’re doing is truly right and just. Sometimes circumstances force us to become what we are not, but if things turn out the way they are who then is able to determine if that they’re doing is truly wrong? What seems wrong to you might seem right to me, to judge without considering both perspectives is wrong. There is an abundance of hidden meanings and depth to be derived from this series and to cover it all would require serious discussion, but to stay on track let’s just say that everything happens for a reason.
Needless to say, a budgetless series like Kimetsu no Yaiba is practically exposed to one of the most stacked Voice Acting casts I’ve ever witnessed, even the extras and side characters are voiced by very prominent VA’s within their field of expertise, when you have the likes of Kaji Yuki, Kana Hanazawa, Hayami Saori, Sakurai Takahiro, Shimono Hiro. You know that you’ll be in for a treat. There’s a reason why these individuals are all prominent VA’s. The studio would never go to such expenses to hire such talent to waste away, this just goes to show how big a potential this series held and how much it is loved by even the cast for them to want to be part of it even as a side character no less.
Even when the narrative at times starts becoming predictable, you almost always feel for the main characters and want them to come out ahead, but when they do you start feeling bad for their opponents even though they’ve been so threatening just moments ago. Every scene and combat brings about tremendous growth for our cast and it helps to develop the series into a gem among gems. The main antagonist is something else, the unsettling feeling that he brings about and how he is the main reason we even have this series is a testament to how great a character he is. Overall, the anime generally takes on a pretty dark tone but the author is able to create silly situations to distract the audience from it. Almost as if to depict that, even within the darkest depths you can still search for the light and eventually is shines just as brightly as ever before.
I absolutely loved the series and can’t wait for its sequel, I know for a fact that the upcoming movie will just be an enabler for Season 2. I am extremely hyped and can’t wait to feast my eyes on this absolute treasure.
A definite recommendation for anyone out there that seeks to watch a great piece of work, perhaps even one of the greatest anime of all time.",10,Alphyx

                Demon Slayer is a visual treat with beautiful sound to back it up. The story is basically a venn diagram of Naruto, Bleach, Shaman King, Tokyo Ghoul, and Inuyasha. A decent distillation of the good stuff with tolerable trope-creep and superior pacing. Except for Zenitsu - he's an unbearable looney toon and hopefully they tone that guy down in future seasons.
Should YOU watch it?
The first five episodes are top notch in all dimensions. The world is built beautifully, the key characters engage us, the tone is set to mature and mysterious, future directions are tantalizing. Everything stews together perfectly and starts to smell amazing. Beautiful
                  artwork, compelling themes, lovely sound, great animation - and a zero-to-hero training arc that is as good as they can get, I suppose. But in the fifth episode a clear shift in direction put me on the fence...
Behind the first door, the show may live up to the promise of the first five episodes and I would be happy I kept watching. Behind the second, the forgettable shonen formula wrings all the special sauce out of the manga, which I don't ever plan to read, and serves us the rest with a sprinkle of badass fight scenes to entice us into consuming trash. Thankfully it lived up to my hopes many times and only lapsed into garbage territory breifly in ways that don't matter that much. The Gotei-9 for example were absurdly lame, but they're only on screen long enough to screw up half an episode. The fight scenes were VERY badass, and spread in a thick layer across the entire season rather than sprinkled with a cherry on top of episode 19. While our main character is a bit of a wet blanket and his crew as useful as urinal cakes, between Nezuko and the bad guys it works out. 
My take is that you will not be disappointed with the quality of the first five episodes, and will see in that time exactly what the show has to offer. Can't go wrong up to that point. Demon Slayer feels just a bit unique, and to me it's greatest strength is the atmospheric art + sound + animation combo that really breathes life into the demonic abilities of opponents and makes a spectacle of the fight against them. Add to this the flashback sequences we get that humanize the demons, and we've definitely got a deeper battle-shonen here than most.",9,PiereDelecto

                Ever since the passing of his father, Tanjiro Kamado has taken many responsibilities to shoulder his family. While the Kamado family lives impoverished, they are happy together living a peaceful life in the mountains. On his way back home after selling charcoal to the local village, he settles down for the night in a strangers home. The stranger warns him about the existence of dark flesh-eating creatures of the night, demons. Tanjiro arrives back home after sunrise, discovering his family to have been slaughtered. That's not all, his sister Nezuko managed to survive the slaughter, but is now a demon herself. Unable to put Nezuko
                  down, Tanjiro tried to get through to her, reminding her of who she was, and who he is. Astonishingly, he was able to get through to her, stopping her from killing her brother. Tanjiro now swears to have his vengeance against those who have slaughtered his family, and vows to stay by Nezuko. His journey begins with the discovery of a mysterious group, the Demon Slayer Corps.
Shounen anime in recent years have really been going above and beyond the shounen standards we've come to know by now. Demon Slayer, is one such example of how to buck the long running trends of shounen anime, all while still being just as bad-ass and impactful for fans.
At its core the anime is actually rather slow, something I'm sure most of us are familiar with when it comes to shounens. It does pretty much all you would expect of a modern shounen anime. Lengthy battles, an emphasis on power levels, adapting to your opponent/environment over the course of multiple episodes, dialogue during fights, you name it. Yet it manages to do all of this seamlessly with an equal amount of urgency and intensity. Every episode felt quick and eventful, as if I had just sat down to watch my episode of the week, only to feel like it ended as I sat down. when in actuality it was twenty minutes of exciting moment to moment action intricately woven together by it's plot. Guess I never got to physically sit down in the first place, since Demon Slayer had me so far on the edge of my seat I was practically standing. The only time this anime ever hard stopped or slowed down, was when the characters themselves physically needed a moment to rest and recuperate. Make no mistake though, those episodes were fantastic too, overall the pacing itself is damn near spot on, and I haven't even talked about the characters yet!
I'll be focusing on mostly Tanjiro and Nezuko since the other leads show up later, and are better seen on the big screen rather than read about. I'll start with Nezuko since it's pretty straight forward, she's very adorable, endearing, and cool in combat when Tanjiro lets her out of her box. That's pretty much it though, sorry Nezuko fans, I've just got more to say about Tanjiro. Tanjiro is a good lad through and through, though there is one thing that separates him from the majority of shounen protagonists, compassion. Because of his dilemma with Nezuko, Tanjiro has a much deeper connection to the demons in this anime. That connection might not be directly, but sympathy goes a long way when he needs to cut down someone who's going through the same struggles as his beloved sister. Unlike most protagonists, they don't truly understand what their opposition has gone through, what unfair cards they have dealt, Tanjiro understands that. It's what makes Tanjiro's personal quest so captivating, for him to save his suffering loved one who is fighting just to stay in control, he must put those who have lost control to rest. Tanjiro is without a doubt in my mind, the best boy of 2019.
Anything else I could talk about this anime would just come off as gushing at this point, since the anime has no obvious faults. The 2D animation is on point while also including some well thought out usage of CGI, the soundtrack is exhilarating, and the voice actors all put in a great effort! There really is no shortcoming in Demon Slayer I can think of, Ufotable put a lot of effort into making this anime the best it could be, and it worked! While my review will end here, Demon Slayer's anime won't stop here, thanks to the immediate reveal of a movie sequel coming in the near future, the Infinite Train arc. Until then, I'll be waiting, as for anyone who hasn't jumped on this hype train yet, the time is now!",10,AndyKyrielight

                Demon Slayer, the biggest hit of the new anime that came out in 2019. 
Story: 
Classic shounen, it's simple and straight forward, so no plot twists or anything tbh, therefore it's quite predictable, but still, the narration is well paced. 
Art: 
Hey come on, it's ufotable, 9/10 is even an understatement to the fantasic animation that the staff has produced. 
The blend of 3D and 2D fight scenes are just perfect, it's just on another tier compare to other anime series out there. 
The water breathing really gives you that ukiyoe kind of feeling, and it's been executed perfectlySound & music: 
Still, outstanding sound effects, you can literally feel the different breathing techniques
The op Gurenge by LiSA was amazing, the song from episode 19 Kamado Tanjiro no Uta was amazing, the ed was good, totally satisfied
Character:
Characters have their depth, even the demons have good background stories, everything justifies their actions. 
I think the construction of Tanjiro's character was good, he is yasashi, but he is not a sanctimonious dude, unlike some other characters who let the evil survive because the villans will be rEfOrMeD
so, well done
Enjoyment: 
Easy 10/10 for me, I was totally sinked into the story, but keep in mind, the enjoyment is based on personal experience. 
So overall, a 10/10 for Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba",10,Sine-Pai
38000,"
                Ugh. I am gonna say it now. This show is an overrated piece of garbage that had the potential to be not.
The story starts with Kamado family bonding then fast forward, they are killed by a demon and while they are killed the MC, Tanjiro was away. When he got back, he was shocked. Nezuko, the only survivor of the attack, was on the verge on dying then she became a demon. Giyu arrives at the scene to kill the demon, which is Nezuko, so he and Tanjiro fought a bit but in the end, because this garbage is so unoriginal, Giyu spares Nezuko for
                  no logical reason. After that, Tanjiro then made a resolve. REVENGE!!(Ugh. Cringe level over 9000). Then *drum roll* DEMON SLAYER!!! Wow! What a terrible premise but the fans said ""iT gEtS bEtTeR fRoM hErE"" so I pushed through.
First, we enter a generic training arc that only has animation (the blinded A LOT of people) as its redeeming factor. There is a part here that show how poor the storytelling of the show is. We see Tanjiro training with Sabito and Makomo. Shing shing sword fight then at the end, Tanjiro and Sabito had a clichè final sword slash. Tanjiro appeared to cut the mask of Sabito but then few shots later the stone the he cannot cut at the earlier part of the arc was cut in half. It was revealed then that Sabito and Makomo are actually dead. So my question is all this time was the rock moving and having a sword fight with Tanjiro? Such a poorly written and told fight. 
Then it was revealed that Nezuko was sleeping all the time and apparently sleeping makes up for hunger. Ugh. Fucking wasted potential development. Instead of giving Nezuko internal struggles of suppressing hunger and developing her from there, we get this lazy ass writing that Sakonji used an off screen hypnosis so that Nezuko won't eat humans. Clap, clap, clap. 
Development: Am I a joke to you? 
We could have been shown clips of Nezuko eating animals to supress her hunger and at some point make a conflict between her and Tanjiro but no the author is lazy af. This could've made her an interesting and compelling character but now she is just a cardboard of an character that is mostly used for cringe ass fanservice. nEzUkO kAwAiI.
Then after the training arc, we go to the final selection. There we had the first villain, the green-giant-slime guy. Typical. Tanjiro was struggling at first then at the end he wins despite not being strong enough and what is worse is that the ones with Tanjiro also undergo almost the same or exactly the same amount of training as him. Nonsensical power scaling. But there is a larger problem here. While training, Tanjiro is shown to only use normal sword attacks but during the fight suddenly he can use Water Breathing attacks that are NOT shown during the training. Sure he was also practicing his actual breathing but how does it become a Water Breathing attack was never shown. So in other words, the techniques he use (from Breathing 1-10) are like asspulls. This show uses the training arc in the worst way possible. 
After that we had a few missions of Tanjiro and Nezuko fighting demons. After all those fights, the show tries to make you feel sad for the demons but the execution (at least to me) is so bad , especially with the drums demon. I jUsT wAnT sOmEoNe tO hEaR mE!!!, that instead of making me sad, it makes me laugh and cringe at the same time. Their flashbacks are to edgy for me. Like please, give your villains variety. Have a demon that is just a villain till the end. Don't make them all people with sad past. It gets tiring fast.
Episode 19 is trash. Its writing is Fairy Tail writing. ""Hinokami Kagura"" is one of the biggest asspulls of the year. Water user becoming able to use Fire (without training) in the verge of being killed is one of the worst moments of 2019. After Tanjiro ""beheading"" Rui, the author tries to make his failure weigh lighter so he made a Diabolus Ex Machina for Rui. He actually beheaded himself before Tanjiro can cut him so that it won't look like Fairy Tail. Wow so forced. Author-san if you think you got out of the shithole, NO! It just shows how poorly written this show is. Nezuko using Demon Arts despite sleeping 80% of the time and also without training is also an offender. 
I almost forgot the two horrendous main characters, Inosuke and Zenitsu. Two characters with little to no development and are just there for ""comedic"" relief but they are pure annoyances. Inosuke was just too bland for me to care so....meh but Zenitsu......He is easily one of the worst characters in 2019. His character is to be annoying. Shouting here, fainting there. Funny? HELL NO!! His power is pure Deus Ex Machina and is not ashamed to hide it. 
We have better revenge stories out there like Vinland Saga, which is now my gold standard for revenge stories. The author knows what he wants to do. He makes Thorfinn look pathetic because he wants to get his message across to the viewers. Revenge is stupid and a waste of time. By Episode 22 of VS, this message was sent across perfectly. That scream from Thorfinn realizing he wasted years of his life for revenge was well done. Back to Kimestu no Yaiba, revenge here is taken in such a shallow way. Revenge is just an excuse for Tanjiro's fight with demons to have ""weight"" but it has little to none, at least to me.
Like every 10/10 anime has flaws, a 1/10 anime also has positives. Kimetsu no Yaiba is no exception. The last episode (Muzan killing the lower moons) was actually pretty solid. That's it. Omegalul. Bye. Peace. Signing Out. 
Anything not mentioned, is either a clichè moment that didn't really piss me off or a forgettable moment.
Wait. What the fuck is the purpose of making Muzan look gay?",1,Dystopie
38000,"
                In my opinion, Kimetsu no Yaiba is one the most shallow but over-hyped animes I have ever watched. Every time I watched an episode, I was always expecting some improvement to unfold on the next one (it's ufotable's bro). Sadly, it never happened and I ended up wasting my time finishing the whole episodes for this season with a big disappointment.
As others have mentioned, the animation and sound for Kimetsu no Yaiba are arguably one of the best out there. However, art and sound alone are weak components to make an anime worth watching. Some animes with poor animation such as Kemono Friends and Kemurikusa,
                  which happen to be from the same studio Yaoyorozu, are far more enjoyable to me than this piece of half baked anime. In fact, I consider Kemono Friends as a master piece.
Finishing the whole season of Kimetsu no Yaiba makes me wonder where does all the hype for Kimetsu no Yaiba come from? Or is it just me?",2,ScienceLover
38000,"
                Kimetsu No Yaiba is a masterpiece in the making, it doesn't have the best or most original story but it has the capability of going the unpredictable way when faced with cliches, it has creative writing, art, animation and a great set of characters that help it achieve much more than most action/drama anime which is why it became as popular as it is now. 
What makes the anime stand out are the good characters as well as the animation/art. The animation/art part is predictable though, I mean it is Ufotable after all so I never expect any lazy parts in that part but let's
                  talk some more about the characters. 
The characters are amazing, Tanjiro who I think is a main character done right, he isn't an angry edgy teen or a coward of an MC, he is a calm MC that doesn't have superpowers yet he is so mindful that he tries to use whatever he has to become a stronger person, he didn't let the hate consume him and make him think that all demons are like that because they like it, they too feel the pain and suffering and some of them were forced into it because they don't know any better. Of course best girl Nezuko is a very big reason for that, she is also a very good kind and caring character. Those 2 made the anime much better, they created a wonderful atmosphere with familial love and caring for eachother and that was enough to make them great. 
I also loved the fact that even the villians had great backstories, it shows the pain they felt and how they were forced into turning into a demon. They fear and feel hatred and sadness which shows that despite turning, they still have somewhat a human side to them, this is also one of the best parts that showed how good they were as well as how great of a character Tanjiro is to understand that and grant them peacefull death instead of suffering. This is a spoiler so SPOILER WARNING IN THE NEXT SENTENCE but the death of the spider queen was by far the best one. It showed how the mindeset of Tanjrio changes once he gains knowledge of anything and how just feeling that a character has been through stuff makes him think of his choices. 
All the other characters are great, from his friends to the other side characters and villians, they were all great and had unique characteristics. 
The voice acting was great so 10/10 as well as the OSTs/OP/ED songs. 
Overall I would give thie anime a 9/10. This anime has been extremely fun and enjoyable, this should be enough for me to give it a high score tbh. 
Would recommend it to anyone tbh.",9,RPWPA

                Kimetsu no Yaiba´s strong side is without a doubt the production value of Ufotable. It can shine with good music, fluid animations, decent artwork and nice character design. 
The problems seem to lay just under the highly polished surface. Especially the story, worldbuilding and characters are sadly quite lacking. 
Before i go in deeper in my reasoning i would like to make a comparison to make my problems with the series so far a bit more clear.
KnY is basicly Claymore, just with the problems inverted. Instead of a focus on the character and world building, Kimetsu is showing of spectacle.
Both anime are about a child
                  that loses it´s family to dangerous humanoid monsters, joins a shadowy organisation, is given a special sword and is send to take out said monsters. The similarities don´t stop there, but the rest isn´t realy necassary for my comparisson.
The main reason i even make this comparision is that i can see how amazing  KnY could have been. 
I was wondering about the way this world, this organisation or even the skills work, why the characters even do what they do and so on. Are ghosts normal in this universe? Why does Tanjirou think he should spend over 6 month training in the mountains instead of searching a cure for his sister? Why did his scar change and why didn´t anyone in universe reacted to it? How can it be that the people of the land don´t believe in demons anymore, when our MC can´t even make two steps without finding one? How can a demon slayer afford food, medicine or an inn if the organisation doesn´t even pay them? Why would anyone even listen to them after reciving his/her special sword? How does the magic work? 
These problems and questions aren´t present in Claymore and other anime like it and it is so disappointing for me to see such a good looking take on the historical dark fantasy setting, falling over problems that were already solved over a decade ago.
It is sadly not the masterpiece i was hoping for, but it´s entertaining enough for anyone who is solely looking for eye-candy and spectacle.",5,KillTheFuture42

                Hello, today I will be talking about anime, which has won many awards. They deserved every one of those almost. 
Please note that there will be a spoiler but I will notify you before, so you can just skip it if tou haven´t  seen the animation yet.
The anime talks about demons and demon slayers in Taisho- era. It has visually pleasing fight scenes that you can literally watch an hour straight.  It also gives a pretty good insight into how life looked in japan during Taisho-era( 1912-1926). Kimetsu no Yaiba also greatly proteid beauty and the dark of a human soul, in my
                  opinion. 
It really felt like they chose professionals for every department. The history side of anime was rather correct. It made me think that Ms. Koyoharu *(assuming that it was right also in the manga)* either has a historical background (either studied or is an enthusiast).  Movements in anime were on point. Fighting scenes didn´t look dull thanks to that. The storyboard was played out nice even though you mostly watch fighting scenes, I didn't feel bored once.
I read some other reviews and they said the content wasn't anything original. I at first thought the same but for me, I discovered something deeper from it. SPOILER AND TW!! - I cried already in the fifth episode. In the scene where Tanjiro was fighting the hand demon, I thought how the dead children represent the kids in real life who have lost to demons their lives. (mostly through horrible grownups but I also thought cancer and mental illnesses). But also the demon themselves were people who were wronged by society or had some kind of another tragic event in themselves and they didn't know to deal with it other than hurt others- therefore turning into demons. !! And like that the whole story took 360 turns for me. Yes, it was already used context but I feel like Ms. Koyoharu and the animation crew gave it whole new life.
I loved the art style. It didn't look totally different, but it also didn't look like the regular style we see in most animes. Watching Kimetsu no yaiba I saw how similar water in fight scenes looked to the traditional way of portraying water in Japanese art. I felt like it added a nice touch to the historical theme. So I looked for references in other elements too, sadly other elements weren't pictured so traditionally. I also loved these patterns on their clothing!! so unique in my opinion.  One thing that I didn't like was the occasional 3D animations.  I'm just not a fan of 3D in anime.
As for characters, I don´t agree with the best lead character award they got. I mean I loved Tanjiro, who didn't, right? The only problem is I couldn't see any minuses in his personality. He was a little perfect baby and sadly a mary sue. I haven't read the manga. Maybe there they open him up a little better but for now only minus, the main character was another Mary Sue. The same goes for Nezoko but I mean, she couldn't express herself much so I give her that.  For all other characters, you could clearly see their personality, they were all fun and had pretty human traits. I know some Zenitsus and I know some Inosukes. I wish I could have known more about some characters, but I guess that I have to read the manga, and it's hard to come up with so many sad stories. Also, I have to add, all the characters were really pretty.  >///<
But overall I really enjoyed it. I loved how I could add my own depth to it, think along. I will surely watch this anime again and again and I recommend it to ya all.

                Despite any reluctance you might have to watch the show - maybe because it seems like a very generic shounen, maybe because it gained a huge amount of hype you start being sceptical about it, maybe the whole demon slaying thing is not your thing - Demon Slayer is truly a noteworthy piece that will go down the history of anime as one of the classics, I'm sure.
Every show is like a burger, which means it is composed of very crucial ingredients, and lack of a single one of them makes up for a very nasty sandwich.
Let's start with the most important ones: THE BUNS
                  (aka the story). Many shounen buns are the same. You enjoy them, they taste good, they are what makes burger a burger, yet you would welcome some slight variety. In the case of the Demon Slayer, they have some minor difference to them. The story itself is cohesive, does not dawdle too much and has the right amount of comedy snuck into it at the right time. The premise is pretty simple; hunt some demons, but the fact that the show is not stagnant, and the enemies in it scale up in strength after each battle, already proves to be more diverse than most shounen shows. So the story has an actual journey and not just ""fight-relax-fight"" arcs where none of the characters develop at all.
It would not be a burger without a proper chunk of MEAT (aka the characters). There are instances where the meat is undercooked, it is something Gordon Ramsey would yell at. And you get salmonela. The distaste lingers in your mouth hours after consuming it. Fortunately, this meat is juicy and warm. Neither raw nor hard to chew. The progress of characters is clearly there. That is the most defining element of long-running work where you expect things to change. With this it already rivals its big brothers, FMA:B and Hunter x Hunter. All characters have backstory, which is not dragged out and offering the viewer a look into the past of both good and bad guys. The anime also blurs the line between the good and the bad in its revealing of the past. That does not derail Demon Slayer from capturing its evil, for there is a very defined dislikable villain from the beginning.
If you only add some piece of bread and meat, you are essentially having a grill party. That on its own isn't bad, but we want that good sandwich. What do we do? We add the VEGETABLES (aka the art, the visuals). Fresh lettuce, some onion, tomatoes, pickles, you name it! Now, you can wipe that sweat off your forehead, because Demon Slayer is packed with beautiful artstyle. Needless to say, it was made by ufotable, so there is no need to go into the details.
Now, sometimes, or sometimes too often, studios forget about the SEASONING (aka the sound). Or they simply do not have the budget for it, which is unfortunate, but not in this case. Hiro Shimono as Zenitsu does incredible job of being a wimpy crybaby, transitioning into the opposite. Saori Hayami manages to capture the sheer creepiness of her character. Obviously there are many more due to be listed here. Apart from the voice acting, similarly to the artstyle, there should not be any need to justify the glory of the soundtrack playing throughout the whole story.
Coming from someone who despises shounen shows, I seriously recommend everyone who stumbles upon this one to keep watching until the end. There are, of course, some convenient moments, where the plot armor shines brighter than the sun, but that can be forgiven this time given how much the positive things outweight this one little flaw. In the end, Demon Slayer proved to be one exceptionally tasty burger. Naturally it is imperative for the rest of the story to be released, but even so, it would be one of the better shows out there on its own; standalone, first season.",10,AdamozoCZ

Story 10/10
Be prepared for action anime with unexpected, highly emotional twists. The story is about Tanjirou, who was a parentified child (meaning: caring too much weight on his shoulders already), finding his family massacred by demons, with one sister as the lone survivor. To make matters worse, this sister has been transformed into a demon herself. Right off the bat you think “holly shit, what is he going to do with all of this now?” and by “this” I mean having virtually no family, no one to go too and having to decide whether to kill his sister or save her, which in
                  fact, he never hesitated what he would do (hearts, hearts). He decides to protect his sister at all cost and become a demon slayer himself.
What I really liked about this anime is the originality of its script and how well the characters are presented for you to fall in love with them and their story. We see Tanjirou overcome whatever struggle is presented to him, but we also see his sister be a “different demon”, refraining from harming humans and actually helping defeat demons. I really loved their relationship and how they always had each other’s back. I wished my brothers would love me as much!
Art 10/10
This is definitely not my forte, but this anime looked pretty good to me. So many good scenes!! I loved everything, from the designs used with the characters to the colors used on them and backgrounds. This anime, as far as anime drawings can get, felt realistic to me.
Sound 9/10
I am a fan of the opening. Obviously, I had no idea what they were saying, but the song has stuck with me for weeks after I finished the anime. And obviously too, I had to google the translation and it goes too well to summarize the anime itself. 
Characters 9/10
The only reason this section is not getting a 10 is because of Zenitsu and most of the Hashiras, excepting Tomioka. The Hashiras are just a very weird assemble of characters, most of them annoying for either being too extravagant or just plain mean.  Zenitsu I found annoying because he was whining 95% of the times and, when conscious, was just a drag. However, I must say I found it hilarious that he would go unconscious under extreme fear or pressure, would be a superb fighter while “sleeping” and would not remember anything he did while unconscious. I would have preferred him to be asleep for longer time and maybe he would have been less annoying! (I hope this doesn’t get explained as a trauma, because then I would feel sorry for saying he is annoying). I am still at lost as to why Inosuke wears a head of a boar most of the time too. Explanations anyone?
On a positive note, I was moved by Zenitsu’s last moments after fighting the spider group and applaud how smart he was to think of how to prevent blood flowing too much and the venom killing him. 
Tanjirou is as interesting and as strong as a lead character should be. I think Tanjirou is mature beyond his years. I am an adult and I can tell you that finding my whole family massacred like that would have thrown me into an existential crisis. But somehow, he found strength to overcome the situation and protect his sister against all odds. Tanjirou is such a sweet and pure soul that he even felt sorry for the demons and would show them mercy and forgiveness. 
Nezuko is another brilliant character. I was moved by most of the scenes involving her as she mostly came out of Tanjirou’s backpack to protect her brother. And just the fact that he carries his sister in a backpack for her own protection is heartwarming!!…I also loved how Nezuko proved herself to the Hashiras!!
I was glad to see Tanjirou had so much support from Tomioka and Sakonji. They give him the guidance and tough love needed for him to grow under the circumstances. 
On a side note, was I the only one feeling sorry for Rui by the end?
Enjoyment 10/10
This anime had me on high alert all the time while watching. Episodes 19 and 20 were jaw dropping for me! Felt all the feels and more. I really enjoyed Tanjirou’s and Nezuko’s relationship and each character’s journey of growth and development. I can only hope following seasons are as good.
Overall 10/10
I would highly recommend this anime as I haven’t been able to find a flaw or a “but” in it, which, if you check my other reviews, I most certainly always do!",10,lilkraken

                I give the story a 10/10. Nothing complex or original with the main story, but still good and is greatly complimented by the unique and complex setting paired with amazing story telling, and other aspects of the overall story are creative and great. The demons, demon slayers and their powers, fights and dynamics in this world were amazing and I loved it. The extra depth to Tanjiro's family was intriguing. There are small nitpicks I have, but they can Easley be overlooked or rationalized... for the most part. There are tiny plot details that change or don't stick throughout the season, but again, it's not
                  a big deal. With this, and behalf on the 'characters' flaw I will mention, I am taking a point off here. The stories/arcs in this show were amazing. I specifically liked Mount Natagumo arc. I think everything in that arc was outstanding. The story and characters were extremely well written with an antagonist who had a very unique, interesting and well written motive, along with the world building(with the demons, ranks and abilities).
I give the characters a 10/10. The only criticism I have in this department is that Zenitsu, along with some very minor characters, will have a specific character trait that are beaten to death. Now the few characters I am talking about have pretty good characters besides that one issue so far. The only character that has been fleshed out at all in this category is Zenitsu, which I mentioned previously. He still has a good character, and I don't wanna take points off for that specific reason(at least right now because it wasn't that big of a deal). So, getting into the other characters, Tanjiro was an outstanding main character and protagonist for multiple reasons. He is a nice and compassionate guy who is polite and tries to help when he can, but he is not ignorant to danger and will stand his ground when appropriate. This kind of character is amazing, and with his families past having a role in his development and the shows is brilliant. Inosuke was also a great character with a complexion to him that makes him easier to love. Smaller characters still had personality and development, which is always good to see. Even with the antagonistic demons, they have depth to their character to. They have a back-story that succeeds in humanizing them, even though their actions as demons are unforgivable, they were once human, and could have been good people before. Nothing too bad I can say there either.
I give the art a 10/10. The art and animation is beautiful! The whole show is beautiful on its own, but the fight scenes take it to another level!
I give the sound an 10/10. The sound effects were solid and the music was great and made each scene more enjoyable to watch.
I give enjoyment a 10/10. I was glued to this show throughout the whole season and greatly enjoyed it.
Overall, I give 'Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba' a 9.5/10.",10,Michaels_List

                honestly, the first few episodes are kinda meh. sure they look good but past the chara and sound design, it's pretty standard stuff. the power up are weirdly fast and a few things are a little too convenient. zenitsu and the boar are also very annoying at first (it get better, a lot). the storyline and world building is not very original.
that's all, this is all what i can critizise about this show.
EVERYTHING ELSE IS PERFECT! And i don't exagerate. 
The first thing hitting you is the colors, the designs, the flowing movements. Nobody can complain about the visuals, they are among the anime industry
                  best crafted works. Period.
Then, you are hit by tanjirou, the hero of this story. How to say it...he feels FRESH, new. first time meeting Monkey D Luffy kind of new. It's hard to explain what makes him different from all others fictional characters i ever met. You can feel in your guts his humanity, his humor, his sensibility, his whole personality is just...
it's hard to have both men and women fangirling on a character but he deserve it.
Just for him, this show is worth the watch.
the whole season is shonen did well. the sister is super cute but not exagerated, the side characters grow on you very fast and the bad guys are complex and interesting. 
important to note: the women characters are really well crafted, they are not what you usually see in shonen. they feel real and have a lot of personality, all of them.
speaking of it, all characters are very well done. they all have interesting or funny screentime.
overall? it's a must watch. it really surprised me by how good it is.
it get better and better too",10,VertSang1

                Demon Slayer is the latest shounen anime to grace the medium with it’s presence and gain a surge of popularity and praise. And you know, this shounen actually deserves it! The competent writing, endearing characters, Ufotable visuals and music by Yuki Kajiura just screams recipe for success.  Yet despite this agglomeration of positive elements, this series was only able to be just good in my eyes. There were just several bad decisions and areas where the anime failed to reach its potential for me to call it truly great.
Let’s start off with the highlight of this anime: The epic visuals. Ufotable once again proves
                  that they’re one of if the the most competent anime studio out there by providing some truly breathtaking art and animation. And they know they’re good, and you can totally see them flexing in some sequences just to be like “yeah, we can do that” and I just love it. One of the biggest complaints an anime can get is using cgi, yet Ufotable is able to seamlessly implement cgi mechanics into Demon Slayer, and sometimes it fits so well that you don’t even notice that cgi is even being used. Their grasp on environments is simply masterful, especially when animating combat scenes. The battle between Tanjirou and the Drum Demon was memorable simply because of how Ufotable handled the rotating rooms. And speaking of battles, don’t even get me started on the conclusion of the Tanjirou vs Rui fight. The combination of the crisp animation, perfect camera angles, and unique art used on Tanjirou’s sword was probably the peak of the anime. And honestly, the art used on Tanjirou’s sword when he’s using combat arts throughout the entire show has to be one of the most visually pleasing things I’ve seen in an anime. It’s just so cool and soothing to witness. Now I could go on and on about this show’s visuals, but I won’t subjugate you further to my fanboying, so let’s move on!
Of course we shouldn’t let the fantastic visuals eclipse the sound work done by Yuki Kajiura. She once again proves why she’s one of the best in the industry by producing a fitting and memorable selection of music. The more traditional sounds, particularly the chanting used in the main theme and other pieces, just fits so well with the style of Demon Slayer. And of course having Lisa on the theme songs is an added bonus! The seiyuu are a good bunch, and I’m particularly fond of Nezuko’s grunts for some reason. Of course, it does sometimes feel like the voice actors go a little overboard. Looking at you Hiro (Zenitsu) and Yoshitsugu (Inosuke)! But overall, they do a fine job. 
Anime has a knack for creating kawaii imouto characters, and Nezuko is no exception. This girl might not be one for words, but she’s still won over the hearts of many. The poor girl was turned into a demon after a family tragedy, but unlike most demons, she defends humans instead of eating them thanks to the strong bond with her brother Tanjirou. She even helps him fight off other demons. That’s right, she protec. She attac. But most importantly, she fit in backpac! That’s right, this demon girl has the ability to change her size for easy transportation! How convenient! Though you know what one of the best things about her is? The portrayal of the relationship with her Onii-chan. A lot of anime featuring a brother and sister pair usually include an actual sexual attraction from one to another. And while I usually find that to be cute, I like how Demon Slayer took a different approach and showcased a more, uh...""healthier"" type of sibling relationship. The love between them just feels genuine, and they way that Tanjirou and Nezuko support each other through the show has to be one of the best things about it. 
I mentioned in the beginning how there are some things keeping this anime from being great in my eyes. The most prominent of these for me would be that Demon Slayer just takes some things too far. Let me elaborate with some examples.
Zenitsu is clearly the comic relieve guy. He’s a major coward and a bit of a womanizer. Honestly, the comedy of Demon Slayer mostly falls flat for me, but I do find Zenitsu to be humorous. Especially thanks to the comedic way he’s animated sometimes. But the show just goes too far with his antics in some instances that put him in the annoying category. And in some serious scenes, like when a bloody kid dies in Tanjirou’s arms, the next scene is literally Zenitsu being funny. Moments like this just feel like terrible timing to me, and I feel like the dude would have been a lot better if he was toned back some. Regardless, I still like him as a character. 
It’s common in shounen anime for the protagonist to think about literally everything that happens in a battle. This is useful in letting we the viewers know what’s going on and stuff. But my man Tanjirou takes this to another level. There are so many times when the dude is just standing around facing a threatening demon going over so many things in his head without actually fighting that it can get somewhat aggravating. I mean it’s okay to just swing your sword at a demon from time to time without monologuing about what form your using, how you’re breathing, and how exactly you're going to attack every single time!
Finally, I wasn't sure how to feel about the humanization of literally every demon. While I like that it adds depth to these monsters and shows that they too were once human, it's kinda hard to feel for them after they're shown brutally murdering people with no remorse and only showing any semblance of human emotion after their chopped off heads slowly fall to the ground. I could better justify this if only a select few demons were given a lot of screen time and depth and thus a reason to have a tragic backstory or whatever, but all of them? I just don't think it works.
Despite flaws like these, Demon Slayer has many good things going for it. For one, I really like how Demon Slayer deals with training arcs. It’s common in shounen for the weak protagonist to work at getting stronger by developing new skills by working under a master, but there’s just something about how it’s executed in this anime that makes it stand above most of the rest in my eyes. Especially the second training arc where Tanjirou learns total concentration breathing at Shinobu Kochou’s house. Though I’d be lying if I said that the three supportive lolis weren’t a big reason for why I liked the arc so much…Honestly, Demon Slayer has the best training arcs that I’ve seen in a shounen since HunterXHunter. Also, the second half of the anime really picks up in terms of plot and character growth. The fights are better, the stories behind the demons are better, and even loud, boisterous Inosuke gets humbled, showing that even wild boar men can develop! 
Demon Slayer is a really solid anime. It took the typical shounen approach with a few twists and made something really good out of it. Sure, it might have relied on the ""monster of the week"" formula a little too much and have characters who definitely need more development, but there's a lot more source material out there to solve problems like these. Now we just got to hope that Ufotable will give us a sequel somewhere down the line.",7,HellLyter

                Please be advised that this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Kimetsu no Yaiba and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. 
Based off a popular manga of the same name Kimetsu No Yaiba which is better known by its English title of Demon Slayer or alternatively as Demon slaying blade is a adventure, dark fantasy genre anime that gives us a rather unique opportunity to see what will happen if one day a hardworking teenage boy who after the early departure of his
                  father and taking up the hard task of supporting his family as the lone man in the house was to after a delayed return to his home were to not only stumble across the slaughtered remains of his family but also discover to his horror that his beloved younger sibling Nezuko had rather than perish with her family as humans had in fact been infected and transformed into a demon that saw anyone, not of her kind as an enemy. After barely managing to stave off his now demonfied sister while at the same time managing to convince a newly arrived demon slayer from slaying his sister Tanjirou now the  sole human left from his family must now after receiving much-needed guidance from Tomioka the demon slayer embark on a difficult and potentially lethal journey as he sets about joining the one organisation among the world that can potentially hold the cure that can revert his sister back to human form the Demon slaying corps. Though the path will be a fearsomely difficult one for Tanjirou the strong desire to make his beloved sister human again means that no matter who or what stands in his way he will fight to his utmost to protect his sister and his friends while striving to find the one thing that will make his sister human again. While adventure genre animes that feature hero’s that embark on a difficult quest in order to save either their village or their loved ones from harm are a standard feature for Shonen anime what can be said to draw me to Kimetsu no Yaiba was the unique premise that led to Tanjirou’s journey as well as the nature of the war that Tanjirou will be walking into as he sets about joining the Demon slaying corps both of which I felt complimented each other perfectly. The first episode of the series I felt served to prove this preconception of mine as while it did well in introducing both the setting and the tragic circumstances that eventually led to the embarkation of Tanjirou’s journey it also featured the strong blends of tension, revelation, and action that I expected from anime made by Unfotable all of which served to make the first episode a very strong one and convinced me to watch the series to the end. 
The overall story of the series follows the life of Tanjirou Kamado a kind and intelligent teenage boy who until the start of the series lived with the rest of his family in a land that is reminiscent of  Taisho era Japan a time of great change both in terms of society and in terms of advancement both in terms of technology and in the reveal of supernatural monsters that were once thought off as nothing more than myths. In a land that is filled with rapidly changing events and tech and unknown to all but the highest levels of government a secret but fierce battle one where there are no obvious battle lines is being waged between the highly trained and fierce members of the Demon slaying Corps the Kisatsutai and the mysterious but equally monstrous demons that have started to emerge from the shadows of the world as if drawn to the advancement that humanity has made in the recent years. Whether in remote villages or in the newest cities that have taken advantage of the tech advancement to spring up and bring progress to its population this seemingly secret war will leave its mark be it in the form of blood splattered walls of a lone alleyway or in the rash of mysterious disappearances of a host of young woman that leave not even a bone behind. But for the members of the corps though every death that they are unable to save is another source of regret for them it also ensures that they will pay the demons back in death ten times to the amount of suffering that they have inflicted on their victims and ensuring that in this war mercy is a word that doesn’t exist on either side. Into this maelstrom of fierce battles against monstrous and cunning foes Tanjirou must not only use his intelligence and wits but also all of his skills if he ever hopes to not only save his sister but also face the one demon that was responsible for turning his sister Muzan Kibutsuji but before that Tanjirou must not only survive his training but also get strong enough to be acknowledged by his seniors. Only then will he have the strength to achieve his goals. 
Tanjirou Kamado 
Tanjirou Kamado portrayed by veteran voice actor Natsuki Hanae of Aldnoah Zero and Fate /Apocrypha fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A teenage boy that until the beginning of the crisis that ultimately started his journey was only worried about supporting his cherished family and support them through diligence at selling his local wares at nearby towns Tanjirou on initial impressions is shown to be a kind, responsible and hardworking person and was seen to be a person that was both gentle and considerate to a fault always striving to help others and never turning down requests for assistance no matter the favor being asked. An honest, positive and friendly person by nature Tanjirou was shown to be someone that believes strongly in fairness and in repaying the debts that he owes to others a fact that served to ensure that both he and his family were held in high regard by their neighbours. To Tanjirou, in the beginning, being able to both support his neighbours while also doing what he can to support the well being of his family can be said to be everything that he wished for in life which is shown in the interactions that he has with both. However to Tanjirou, this seemingly perfect life was to come to an abrupt end one morning as he returned to find not the heartwarming welcome that he expected from his mother and his siblings but instead find to his shock and horror that all but his younger sister had been slain. With the loss of not just his beloved family but also of the strong emotional ties that linked them together Tanjirou in the aftermath was said to be almost broken both mentally and physically prevented only from giving in to despair by the revelation that his younger sister Nezuko had managed to survive the bloodbath that had claimed everyone else. However, this soon transformed into a bittersweet moment for though she had survived Nezuko had also suffered a fate perhaps worse than death for she had been transformed into the same type of being that had served to destroy the one link that both Tanjirou and she had enjoyed together which was their family. In the aftermath of the tragedy, Tanjirou was forced to accept the cruel reality of the fact that not only was much of his family dead but his lone surviving relative his sister Nezuko had also been transformed into the same beings that had committed the act. Though grief-stricken beyond words Tanjirou rather than give into despair as many would have instead did what many would have thought impossible for a boy his age transforming his grief and sadness from a myriad of negative energy into a potent source of motivation to achieve his new life goal in this harsh new reality that he finds himself in which is to not only find the being responsible for the tragedy that had befallen his family but also, more importantly, find a means to turn Nezuko human again. A goal that soon came to head when Tanjirou was introduced to the shadowy but elite Demon slayers corps that hunts the very beings that he seeks revenge on in dramatic fashion. Though barely managing to stop the corps from killing his sister Tanjirou was soon confronted with not just the sheer magnitude of the path that he had set upon both in terms of finding the demon responsible and in gaining the required strength that he needs to order to achieve his goal a goal that he soon found an answer for in the form of joining the corps as a slayer. 
As the series progresses and Tanjirou comes to understand the harsh realities that the corps puts through to train its personal Tanjirou’s personality gradually starts to change. While largely retaining his kind, gentle and friendly personality Tanjirou is shown to show a great deal of determination both in his quest to overcome his training and also in his desire to achieve his main quest. While the training itself was a tough one it can be seen that Tanjirou rather let the training beat him instead sought to adapt himself to the training so as to allow him to not only gain new skills but also ones that will serve to overcome his inherent flaws of which there were many. While shown to be somewhat slow, indecisive and poor at reading situations in the beginning Tanjirou as the series goes on gradually begins to change becoming more perceptive both in terms of discerning physical expressions and in physical smells and becoming more willing to act on hunches that he senses a skill that gradually allows him to not just make quick but also decisive decisions on the field and in the process allowing him to easily adapt to the fast-changing battlefield. This development both in terms of attitude and skill can best be shown in the way in which Tanjirou handles his missions after becoming a slayer. Rather than give into despair that many of his contemporaries will when confronted with a threat that they cannot overcome Tanjirou will instead seek to adapt his attacks so as to both take advantage of an enemies flaw while also to learn from the mistake that he had made previously a skill that takes great advantage of both his perceptive nature and his desire to learn all he can from his foes and get stronger. However even as a member of the corps it can be seen that Tanjirou has never lost sight of his core values of wanting to help innocents and indeed even as a slayer he still tries hard to help every person that he can in his travels no matter the urgency of his missions or the risks associated with rescuing ones that are located in dangerous terrain. This desire to help all that he can no matter the risks while itself a base trait of Tanjirou’s can also be said to be a development that came from seeing his family butchered as to Tanjirou being able to reunite loved ones, reunite families or allow a grieving fiancée closure by killing the demons responsible for their pain is a small victory in Tanjirou’s eyes. 
As a member of the corps which when combined with his own personal quest its certainly understandable that Tanjirou was someone that can be said to view demons as his sworn enemies but this can be said to be only half true. While Tanjirou himself does indeed bear demonkind with all due hatred he unlike his fellows within the corps was also shown to be able to differentiate between those demons that mean harm to humans and those that bear no ill will towards them. While influenced to a degree by his gentle and friendly nature this desire to converse with peaceful demons and listen to their side of things can be said to be a development that came about as a result of Nezuko’s transformation into a being that while possessing the strength and resilience of demon had also learned to view humans as allies rather than as food. While itself a punishable offence this act of being able to work with like-minded demons shows that while Tanjirou aspires to become strong and attain the strength that he needed in order to find the one responsible for his pain that he has lost none of the qualities that have made him such an endearing person a development that few within the corps are shown to have a development that I felt suited Tanjirou’s desire to become strong while still holding the values and qualities that determine who he was before the tragedy.  
Nezuko 
Nezuko Kamado portrayed by veteran seiyuu Akari Kitou of Classroom of the Elite fame is one of the main characters of the series and is Tanjirou’s younger sister. Before the tragedy that enveloped their family and wrought a cruel fate to her Nezuko was seen to be a kind, caring and friendly girl who though not being able to leave her house to make money in town did all she can to support her mother and her siblings in the absence of a man in the house. However though Nezuko worked hard to support her family and ensure that their life while not one of wealth was most definitely one that ensured that her family was able to survive and eke out a living in relative comfort all of this changed one fateful night when they were attacked by a demon that tragically killed all but herself and her brother Tanjirou. Despite Nezuko’s best attempts to protect her siblings, her efforts were ultimately in vain. However while it was a small comfort that Nezuko did not perish with the rest of her family it can be said her survival while certainly a fortunate one was also one that was overshadowed by the fact that Nezuko was no longer human for she had been transformed into the very beings that wiped out her beloved family a fate that was perhaps worse than death for her. 
After her transformation into a demon Nezuko’s personality changes dramatically. While the transformation into a demon served to take away much of her humanity by way of taking away her ability to speak and show physical expressions that would have added charm to her human self the transformation itself also gave her what can be said to be a form of poetic revenge for Nezuko in her new form was not only able to wield massive strength but also use this to fight against demons and slayers on even if not on skilled terms. However despite the gaining of such strength it can be seen that Nezuko despite not being able to express it as easily feels immense regret and anger with the former due to the fact that she was unable to protect her family from their fate and the latter that she had not only survived but done so in a new form that only served to inconvenience her brother effects that served to impart within Nezuko a sense a frustration in the beginnings of her travels with Tanjirou. In the immediate aftermath of her awakening due largely to the demon blood that was now running through her veins Nezuko was shown to have developed a rather short temper and was shown to display  instances of aggression and anger towards others quite easily a fact that it made it difficult for Tanjirou to transport her in the first days. However as the series goes on and Nezuko through the travels that she experiences  with Tanjirou and the teachings that she learns from the people that they encounter along the way gradually begins to master these sudden urges of her and manages to develop the ability to not only restrain them but also use them at the most opportune moment. Despite being transformed into a demon it can be seen that Nezuko’s transformation itself while certainly giving her the strength of a demon had not entirely transformed her psyche to match it and indeed apart from the aggression that she displayed early in her transformation she unlike other demons did not see humans as food a fact that was used effectively by Tanjirou’s mentor during his training to not only lessen the burden that Tanjirou would have that will potentially affect his progress but also prove to the world that perhaps not all demons are enemies after all. 
As a result of this while still retaining the strength and aggression that defined her new form Nezuko also managed to in the process regain some element of her humanity. Instead of seeing humans as potential foes as she had previously Nezuko now saw them as something that was akin to family that was to be protected at all costs. While ensuring that Nezuko now saw humans as people that she had to protect this also served to reintroduce a number of personality traits that had existed within Nezuko previously that served to enhance her newfound personality with these being loyalty, protectiveness and a determination to do all she can to protect her charges traits that when used in conjunction with the bitter memories of her family only served to ensure that she will fight to the last to protect others. However while developing this new sense of protectiveness towards others it can be seen that this also served to introduce secondary elements into Nezuko in that while remaining protective and loyal towards her new duty Nezuko also displays a curious and somewhat playful nature towards her interaction towards others as shown humorously in her interactions with Lady Tamayo and her charge when she and Tanjirou encountered her. These secondary elements when used in conjunction with her other developmental traits I felt served to expand Nezuko’s character relatively well as while it gave Nezuko the ability to exact revenge on the demons by using her newfound strength to not only deny them their victory but also use it to protect the very innocents that she had been expected to kill to survive it also allowed Nezuko to be seen in a more positive light by others which when used in conjunction with the fact that few see demons as nothing more than monsters is something that’s notable both in terms of story advancement as well as in lore advancement. 
Giyuu Tomioka 
Giyuu Tomioka portrayed by veteran voice actor Takahiro Sakurai of Anohana and Active Raid fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Tanjirou’s allies within the series. A veteran demon slayer of the Demon slaying corps and a member of the corps elite Pillars group the corps nine most powerful swordsmen to which he serves as the Water Pillar. On initial expressions, Giyuu is shown to be a quiet, calm, collected and honest person by nature that was dutiful and unflinching in his duties. While a quiet and somewhat blunt person that showed few emotions Giyuu was someone that was shown to have a strong sense of justice and responsibility and indeed saw it as his sacred duty to come to the aid of innocents that were being menaced by demons to save them as fast as he can. As a result of this attitude, Giyuu was shown to be visibly devastated when he found that he was too late Tanjirou’s family. However, what served to perplex him the most was the fact that though a demon was present in the area instead of running in fear as most humans do upon seeing one Tanjirou was instead trying desperately to protect her something that not even a veteran like him had ever witnessed. 
Like much of the corps Giyuu was seen to view demons as nothing more than a menace and a constant scourge to the innocents that are caught in their sights and as a result was seen to view Tanjirou’s attempts to defend it as nothing more than idiocy a fact that he made plainly to Tanjirou during his first encounter with both him and Nezuko. However as a result of both seeing Tanjirou try so desperately to protect the demon as well of Nezuko work so hard to restrain herself this served to make him for the first time in his career halt his blade. Though seen to be someone that viewed demons with nothing but hatred Giyuu was also shown to be someone that was surprisingly open-minded if only reluctantly. While loaf to let a single demon escape his blade it can be  seen and inferred that like most veterans among the corps Giyuu too was someone that had grown weary of seeing many of his comrades perish on the claws of the demons that they had been fighting for years and as a result though wary of breaking corp laws was willing to at least test out a possibility that no matter how small can prove useful for future generations of slayers a belief that will soon prove beneficial to the corps as Tanjirou not only managed to survive the training that had been obtained at Giyuu’s express wishes but also in the process prove that not all demons were enemies and that perhaps there will be a time when peace between humans and demons will indeed be possible. The character of Giyuu I felt was an interesting character in that while he didn’t exhibit any notable physical changes much of the change within his character actually takes place within his perception and opinion of demons. As a veteran of the corps and one of the elite Pillars that form the cornerstone of it it’s a given that Giyuu’s service with them had been a long one that was full of not just fierce battles that saw impressive triumphs that saved hundreds but also many tragic defeats that cost the corp dearly in lives for both comrades and civilians alike. In this black and white world where death is ever-present while it's easy to lose hope its equally easy to just see every demon as an enemy to be cut down without realising the larger picture. In this I felt that having Giyuu a veteran slayer make the call that has so much potential for change was an excellent development as while not affecting the present situation the potential that the bud that he helped nurture can serve to have a notable effect on the future an observation that was as the series progressed aptly demonstrated. 
Shinobu Kochou 
Shinobu Kochou portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of The Irregular at Magic high school and Owari no seraph fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Tanjirou’s allies within the series. A veteran demon slayer and a member of the Pillars in which she serves as the Insect Pillar Shinobu on initial impressions is shown to be a positive, caring and calm person by nature that exhibited a friendly and polite attitude at all times and was someone that tried hard to bond with others no matter how quiet and blunt they were. Indeed Shinobu’s attitude can also be seen to be a mismatch if one did not know the role that she plays within the corps or the rank that she has then one can easily mistake her for being a normal girl in this age. While a positive person and someone that genuinely enjoys teasing people Shinobu was also someone that was also capable of being serious and in this phase she was shown to be a confident, perceptive and fast thinking person that had a preference for using skilled tactics, perception and patience as much as sword skills when engaged in combat a strategy that can be seen to take great advantage of her role as being the Pillar that makes equal use of poison and healing to both hinder her enemies as well as heal her allies. 
As the series goes on and Shinobu’s personality is expanded upon it can be seen that despite her positive and friendly nature that she like every other slayer within the corps is someone that’s been through pain as well. While Shinobu’s default friendly and caring self can be said to be her true personality it can be seen that this is only half true for while she cares deeply about the lives and well being of her allies and friends Shinobu is someone that prefers to hide her own feelings behind the masks that she creates for while Shinobu was noted to be a powerful swordswoman that when paired with both her experience and her ability as a healer made her even more so she was also noted to be someone that was particularly adept at the use of psychological warfare as shown in the countless battles in which she seemingly gives the impression that there exists a way for a demon to escape only to close it shut when the time comes. This combination of her somewhat sadistic attitude towards demons and her speciality as a combat healer that specialises in the use of poison to disorient and slowly take out demons served to create within Shinobu one hell of an alt personality one that made her an absolute terror to the demons that she faced. While shown to bear the demons with the same level of hatred that most of her fellows do as the series goes on it can be seen that to her the demon was a far more of a personal matter to her as a family matter as it was to her as a professional matter for her beloved sister had perished at their hands as a result of both her desire for peace and an end to the centuries-old war that had existed in the land since ancient times. 
When combined with her own empathic nature as well as her natural kind and caring nature towards her friends and allies this can be seen to cause an inner turmoil of sorts within Shinobu. For while she views the demons that not only took her sister from her but also inflict so much suffering in the world with hatred that served as a potent source of motivation for her to go about her duties her own way she also finds it both difficult and perplexing to find out why her beloved sister would go so far as to lose her own life in order to realise a dream that sounds impossible no matter how you looked at it for to her demons were mere monsters that had to be put down a view that only intensified as the years go by and is only stopped when she encounters a young slayer named Tanjirou whose sincere and determined nature and wish to get stronger so as to get the cure that will free his beloved sister was one that Shinobu both understood and can relate to qualities that served for the first time since her sisters passing to reveal the fierce conflicts that she was struggling with beneath her mask one that may soon see salvation if change is indeed coming to the age-old war between the demon and the slayer. 
AMV 
In terms of  both character designs as well as in environmental design and terrain variety I felt that the locations and settings that were featured within the series were not just beautiful but also well thought out while also taking excellent advantage of the foundation of the time period being a close approximation of the Taisho era a time period that blended in emerging cities with the still largely rural villages and towns that dotted the country. The effects of such a fine balance between modern cities and rural areas was seen well in the different types of operating areas in which Tanjirou’s missions sent him to notable examples being the demon forest and the town that served as the AO for Tanjirou’s first mission.  In terms of character designs, I felt that the individual characters featured within the series whether main ones, support ones or even bystanders were excellent showing not just excellent attention to detail but also variety as well with the members of the Demon slayer corps being the notable examples. With regards to the demon designs I felt that while the great majority of the demons were beast-like there were also a number of demons that looked human like which while allowing them the ability to blend into society also afforded them the ability to feed on a unsuspecting population as well a fact that did well to illustrate that  while society was advancing at breakneck speed that beneath society a secret war was being waged and that demons can literally be anyone. While affording them a degree of mystique I also felt that this also served to differentiate the demons as within the series the ones that resemble humans were shown to be the ones that were the more powerful ones that could call upon a greater variety of skills when they engage with notable examples here being the spider demon family. Combat animations wise I felt that the combat within the series is a definite highlight of the series due to the combination of fluid combat animations with the sword effects and Tanjirou’s thread seeing aspect being notable examples and the well designed and executed battles that combined both the inherent tension that came from fighting powerful enemies and the fact that you were fighting against something that can potentially call upon hundreds of abilities that can skewer you if you’re careless. While the battles were certainly beautiful to look at I felt that they also made great use of both Tanjirou’s developing skills as a slayer both physically and mentally and the inherent abilities that his opponents made use of to give us many excellent battles where the stakes were extremely high with notable examples being the fight against Muzan’s lackeys and the fight within the demon forest. While combat animation was extremely strong I also felt that the series also managed to use the strong animation to enhance this via the creative use of patterns and visual representation of Tanjirou’s senses with the former being seen in his attacks and the latter in his keen sense of smell both of which served to enhance Tanjirou’s ability to deal with emerging threats. 
In terms of music the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Gurenge for the former and from the edge that was both performed by veteran singer LISA both while excellent songs served to induce within me a different set of emotions with the former introducing a sense of loss, tension and a strong desire to go up against the odds and achieve a strong goal while the latter was a calmer one that gave the impression of happier and more peaceful times that I felt alluded to the life that Tanjirou had before the demons struck. The series OST I felt was one that was not only well designed but also one that featured a surprising variety that allowed it to complement the various scenes and emotions shown within the series relatively well varying between dramatic ones for the battles and calming and peaceful ones for the training arc and the off-time between the battles where Tanjirou was bonding with his comrades. Voice acting-wise I felt that the series main and support cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or support ones. In particular, I feel that Natsuki Hanae, Saori Hayami, Takahiro Sakurai all did an excellent job at portraying the main characters of Tanjirou, Shinobu and Giyuu respectively with Saori Hayami in particular deserving of special praise on account of her brilliant portrayal of Shinobu. With the regards to the support cast I felt that Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Ai Kakuma, Maaya Sakamoto, Houchuu Ootsuka, Ami Koshimizu, Yuri Ehara and Ryouko Shiraishi all did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Inosuke, Makomo, Lady Tamayo, Sakonji, Mother spider demon, Aoi Kanzaki and the older sister spider demon respectively. 
Overall conclusion 
In overall Kimetsu no Yaiba I felt was an excellent anime that was undoubtedly one of this years best with its main strong points, in my opinion, being its unique premise, strong and well thought out story that weaved together breathtaking action with excellent lore, excellent characters that were both unique and well developed, Well designed and developed battles that took great advantage of both the beautiful combat animations and the large amount of demon abilities that were seen within the series, excellent voice acting from a talented voice cast and a gradual expansion of the history and circumstance of both sides as Tanjirou enters that fabled world. 
The overall story of the series can be said to be one of the series main strong points and in my opinion, was one of the main things that served to draw me to this series. While the idea of a protagonist electing to embark on a journey that would allow him to get stronger is the staple of shonen manga I felt that in this case the story actually paired well with its unique and shocking premise as while Tanjirou was indeed embarking on a journey to get stronger he was doing so for a far more personal reason than gaining strength for first and foremost he was doing so in order to find a cure for his sister and revert her back to human form. In this way, it can be said that the journey to becoming stronger was only a convenient method so as to achieve this goal. The overall goal of Tanjirou though certainly a seemingly impossible one and one that was fraught with peril I felt were paired relatively well with the overall story through its use of both the inherent bonds and chemistry that exists between Tanjirou and Nezuko as well as Tanjirou’s visualisation of what an actual family should be like. While these served to create within Tanjirou a potent source of motivation I felt that this also served to allow him to see the war between the demon and the slayers in a new light as unlike Giyuu and Shinobu who as members of the Pillars had been fighting the war for years and had seen countless comrades cut down in the line of duty and who viewed demons with nothing but disdain Tanjirou was different due to both his unique goal and his own view on what a family should be like. In this Tanjirou rather than view every demon that he encounters in his journey as a hostile that’s to be cut down immediately instead does the opposite preferring to instead listen and understand their side of the story first before making a decision. 
While combat itself is not always unavoidable I felt that this served to not only show Tanjirou’s desire to avoid needless slaughter while also allowing each of the demons featured within the series to have much more of an impact on both him and the overall plot. This within the series is helped greatly by the fact that rather than being simply one dimensional characters as many Shonen manga like to portray their primary hostile characters the demons shown within the series were not just powerful ones but also ones that had unique personalities that not only made them a match for the slayers in terms of intelligence and cunning but also in physical might as well on account of the variety of abilities that they can call upon all of which served to make each encounter that Tanjirou has with them a thrilling experience as one can not tell easily if a demon is a hostile one that has problems like the spider demon family or benevolent ones like Lady Tamayo who have surprisingly human-like problems that are bothering them. While serving to add a degree of variety to the overall story I felt that this expansion of the demons also served to show that while demons and humans are different beings they are in fact very similar to each other on account of both the environments that they live in and the problems and struggles that they have to struggle within their lives matters that while the rank and file slayers will never comprehend that Tanjirou thanks to his unique origins will and in doing so making the story that much more interesting. 
However while Kimetsu no Yaiba was an excellent anime I felt that there were some elements that served to derail the otherwise stellar anime that it almost managed to achieve. One of the things that I disliked about the anime was the character of Zenitsu. On a character level, while having one that starts off as weak and cowardly and gradually developing him into a stronger character as the series progresses is the standard developmental method within animes, in this case, I felt that as a character he barely had any kind of development that eliminated this trait of his. And while admittedly his unconscious attacks on his foes were cool this was offset by the fact that his constant shouting and complaints were annoying at best and immersion breaking at worst something that shouldn’t be within animes in the first place. In addition while Kimetsu no Yaiba’s story was touted to be a tale that allowed Tanjirou and Nezuko to fight together as a team as they both get stronger I felt in actual practice only Tanjirou managed to gain this strength due to the training that he received from his seniors and fellow members of the corps while Nezuko within the series had a gradually diminishing amount of appearances within the series to the point where we often forget that she’s even here. This I felt was a shame as shown in the fight that Tanjirou engaged in during his first mission as well as during the defence of lady Tamayo the team-up between the two can be devastatingly effective against their foes when used correctly. 
Overall I feel that as a final score that Kimetsu no Yaiba deserves a final score of 9/10 that while featuring an excellent premise, story, battles, animation, voice acting and a welcome insight into the struggles that both sides experience in the war was let down by a number of issues that serve to derail the overall experience.",9,Shingster

                This review will contain mild spoilers. 
Kimetsu no Yaiba is an anime released in 2019, made after a manga from Shounen Jump. It's a standard battle shounen that was helped a lot by the fact that the studio responsible for the animation is ufotable (Fate/Zero, Fate/Stay night unlimited blade works, Tales of Zestiria etc).
The problem is that the animation quality is the only really good aspect of the anime. When you have a higher score on MAL than true masterpieces like Monster, Gurren Lagann, The Monogatari series, The Tatami Galaxy, Ping Pong The Animation or even Fate/Zero from the same studio it's clearly that something
                  is wrong.
The story is as basic and plain as they come, nothing really original, nothing really interesting, the arcs are repetitive, just like in My hero academia. The main characters are annoying, and they have a massive armor plot, almost at the same level of things like Fairy Tail. The main character Tanjiro at one point is given the help of his father's ghost and he learns a new technique on the spot, a completely unannounced thing, no foreshadowing at all, it just happened just for Tanjro to survive. And that is not the only ghosts that helped Tanjiro, earlier in the series, 2 ghosts of former apprentices of his master appeared and helped Tanjiro to get more powerful. Maybe it's a Star Wars reference and Tanjiro is Luke Skywalker, who knows. 
Basically when the author created the world in his work, I don't think he thought too far, like how to properly apply the rules of the world he created which is a shame because he breaks the very rules he created so he can get his characters new power-ups and save their lives.  
The design of the characters is also pretty basic, the worst being that of The Pillars who seem like they are directly recycled from certain characters from Bleach or Naruto. 
As for the comedy, although I think comedy is subjective in general, I can't help but find the so called comedy, cringeworthy in this anime. Zenitsu in particular I think was written as a stress relief character, but in the end all he brought to the table was pure cringe. Inosuke at least is better in that aspect. 
The handling of the drama is also poorly made. Basically drama in this anime translates to Tanjiro and co. almost getting killed, plot armor generated powers coming in, so the demons can finally get killed. 
The animation is great, one of the best this year, I don't really have any complaints here and the soundtrack is good but pretty forgettable
This anime has become quite popular just because anime as an entertainment medium is becoming quite mainstream and Kimetsu no Yaiba acts like a gateway to anime for many new viewers, just how many of us have started with anime like Gundam, Cowboy Bebop, Sailor Moon, Pokemon, Naruto, Bleach or My Hero Academia. The difference between all these shows is that some are well written, some are not. Kimetsu no yaibase falls in category two unfortunately. 
Also the argument that some give that it gets better in the manga, as the first season covers only the beginning of the story is a completely illogical and irrelevant because I only judge the anime here not the manga here and I don't judge based on future events in the manga, I judge on what happened in season one of the anime. The bottom line is that season one, which is just the beginning of the story, is nowhere near as great as some people make it seem.
My final rating is 5/10, which according to MAL ratings it means average or mediocre, and that's what I really think it was. Great animation and a nice soundtrack does not save this anime from the fact that all the other aspects are modest at best.",5,DeathTheKid4

                I didn't mean to watch this anime, since it came out last year and I already had a long list of titles to check out... But then I kept on hearing people mention it and I saw some youtube clips. I felt hyped to it was the perfect time to watch it and actually finish it. And, what can I say, that was the right choice. Recently I even finished the manga, so I have some room to compare. 
Main reason for my high rating is... there's nothing really I disliked. There were a lot of things I loved, that's for sure. The genre and
                  themes are all in line with what I like and search for in what I watch, but I was quite surprised when I finished watching and realized that I can't really point anything out. If I thought really hard about it, there could be some minor details, maybe. But when I was watching and after, nothing bothered me. When I think about Demon Slayer I only have good feelings and memories, so I'm grateful for that.
First of all, the art style and animation is obviously amazing. I noticed CGI at a few instances, but it wasn't that bad. But CGI is CGI, it still catches your eye and looks out of place if you notice that it's there. Other than that, the animation is top notch, especially in the fight scenes, where they use their special moves. A lot of vibrant colors, be it blue Water Style or red Dance of the Fire God or even yellow Thunder... The fluid and energetic movements... It really feels like everything from the manga came to life. Not only the fight scenes. Obviously, you can't properly express characters like Zenitsu or Inosuke on paper. When you hear Zenitsu's ridiculous screams and see Inosuke slamming his head into a tree like a maniac, it's just great.
I can actually remember some of the soundtrack which is strange, since I usually don't. Maybe it's because those are good songs, maybe because they really fit in the moment... Well, I can say the music is good.
My favourite part is the overall plot/characters/relationships/worldbuilding. Nezuko and Tanjiro are just such an amazing duo. Nezuko's special circumstances and cuteness make her really lovable. She saves the day multiple times and just by her defiant existance is bound to help much more, even though some people don't accept her. Zenitsu is very annoying at the beginning, but then you get used to him and see that he's a good person and can actually fight sometimes. Same with Inosuke, at first annoying with his desire to always fight but also funny and you get used to him. The backstory is quite interesting, with one person being the original demon who can turn others, or with the Demon Slayers who aren't recognized by law and not everyone knows that demons exist unless they meet them themselves. I liked how surprised Tanjiro was, seeing a big city for the first time, living his whole life in mountains. Some people make coal as their job, some people fight demons with their swords, some people ride trains. It's different everywhere.

                What do you get by bringing together gorgeous visuals, a majestic soundtrack and talented voice actors to animate a relatively good but not too excellent manga? A shockingly masterpiece of an anime is what you get.
I initially decided to pick up Demon Slayer due to the sheer hype, I initially started with the manga (which was good in my eyes but not really a record breaking series) until I picked up the anime, which really brought the intriguing story to life and truly making the watch a very memorable one
The story of Demon Slayer is relatively straightforward, with a few obstacles blocking Tanjiro's way to
                  achieving this. Although unfortunately, the series may be guilty of utilizing plot convenience at times. However, the plot is definitely quite mesmerizing and a relatively unique one at that with the historical elements of the series really being brought out in a good light and the stakes and intensity really remain high at every episode to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.
The art in the manga was absolutely gorgeous but made the fight scenes and breathing techniques seem extremely underwhelming. Ufotable has certainly outdone themselves with how absolutely stunning they made the fight scenes look, You can quite literally pause an episode at any given moment and make it a wallpaper with how stunning most of the visuals are, with a perfect balance of CG and regular 2D animation. The camera angles of some scenes are especially exquisite, it made some scenes that were otherwise quite normal in the manga seem extremely epic in the anime, whether it be fight scenes or certain character reveal scenes. The setting is just breathtaking, literally the first minute in the snowy plains was just a hint of what was to follow.
The soundtrack of Demon Slayer is incredible in its own right, massive props to the sound production team. The anime has its fair share of emotional or epic scenes greatly amplified due to the well made and well timed soundtrack, and I doubt any complains can be made about it. The VFX of the anime meets expectations, though does not exceed them either, with the setting having very realistic background audio and certain attacks having well chosen sounds to give a realistic yet fantasy feel to it
The characters, in manga form, were quite average in my eyes with Zenitsu in particular quite lacking, especially in the comedy aspect. But the Anime certainly obliterated these weaknesses, The incredible voice acting really helped express the emotions of certain characters in emotional scenes while successfully creating humor for comedic scenes. Tanjiro's personality of being an extremely kind, caring and selfless person yet ruthless and overly emotional at times is a very interesting character I hope to see developed even further in the coming seasons just as the manga had. I personally enjoy the innocent sibling love that is a prominent element of the series rather than some forced romantic relationship that seems to plague many other shonen series in the present. Even characters such as Zenitsu and Inosuke received minor developments by the end despite appearing in about half the season. Not to mention the introduction of the Hashira is a great set up for future character development as well.
Also worth noting is how incredibly fleshed out many of the villains are, it truly portrays how most demons are just victims of temptation rather than catalysts of death and evil. Which truly makes you respect Tanjiro's character for truly empathizing with them despite having suffered so much from them
In conclusion, Demon Slayer is certainly a series worth picking up and the anime has done a splendid job in not only honoring the manga but even exceeding it in various aspects. One of the best recent series that Shonen Jump has been blessed by and I truly hope Ufotable can do as splendid a job in adapting the last few arcs (or even exceeding the manga again) just as they have done during this season",10,Potatobanana

                Listen. Do NOT listen to the hate people have about this show. It became extremely mainstream and thus it’s super edgelord and hipster to hate on it unfairly. It definitely is not everyone’s cup of tea I shall admit but there is a lot that it does right. I personally adore this show, but I will give it a fair assessment for anyone who reads this. 
Story: To me this is the one area where I feel complaints are valid. It’s definitely set up in the shounen structure. Kid has tragedy, becomes strong  and trains to beat ultimate bad guy. The breadth of depth
                  to this show does get lost. This goes mostly into character development, which I’ll touch later, and is vastly misunderstood and underrated imo. 
The story is part historical, and part fantasy obviously. It feels a bit like the chimera ant arc in HxH meets Rurouni Kenshin. Not quite but that will give you a general gist of it. The sword fighting techniques used against the demons and their powers feel different to each and every character and gives some depth to battle, and really employs strategy not found as often in this genre. There is some good world building and hidden plot threads to chew through once more seasons come. If you can handle shounen and like sword fighting and not crazy like blasts, and some slow pacing at the beginning, then you will enjoy this show. 
Sound: fantastic OST. This is personal preference but honestly the intro and most of the sound overall is pretty well done. The intro always got me pumped and the voice acting in the sub was fantastic. 
Art: does this even need to be stated? Have you seen fate/stay? It’s unfotable. They are God’s among men with their animation quality and both the battle scene that had this show trending worldwide and the last episode especially stood out. 
Characters: This is the part I hate criticized the most.  Zenitsu, thunder wimp, whatever you want to call him gets especially hated on. For the anime only people, they see the character as a total pain to listen to. They actually seem to hate him, but all his bad qualities are there to show his development which is to come in the story further down the road.  Same with the “pig headed” inosuke (pun intended). Best girl Nezuko clearly has character growth throughout the first season even if she does play second fiddle to the MC. The hashiras all have individual personalities which haven’t been explored yet, but most of the supporting cast really gets some TLC to have growth, even if there wasn’t enough time to do so in season one. A lot of the demons get fleshed out back stories. Although considering the time of these flashbacks a brief amount of character growth is obtained but clearly they are still demons who have murderer and consumed humans 
Let’s get to the real meat and potatoes. Let’s talk MC. A lot of complaints and I say they are a little warranted is the lack of growth for the MC. This is not at all true. After his family is attacked, killed and turned into demons which kicks off this story he is steadily improving. A weak child unable to protect and now vowing to do whatever to save his sister. His growth is in that department and a bit less emotional. This is not a bad thing at all. Let me explain. 
Our MC Tanjiro is pretty different from most shounen characters. He doesn’t like to fight. He doesn’t believe in a magic power of friendship. He simply is doing what he must to protect his sister. He fights for his sister and his love for her and his family takes root. This leads to growth between their dynamic and leads to both of them getting tougher mentally and physically. That said there are characteristics of Tanjiro that is so vastly different from other characters, specially in this show. Tanjiro is not afraid to strike and demon down. He is however gentle as a breeze. He is calming and soothing and feels pity and sorrow for the horror a lot of the demons went through to get there. He is kind and nice and isn’t your over the top white knight, even if he is constantly seen helping. He is just gentle and is unswaying in his personality. So much of his growth is set to be physically improving, learning the secrets of his father, and growing his bonds with his sisters and friends so he has motivation to work harder. He really has some shining moments coming even if currently they haven’t aired much of his personal growth in season 1. 
Conclusion: I cannot convince you to like the story or setting. Some people don’t like shounen and don’t like fantasy action. After reading the manga to current I can honestly say I loved the story, for the story. I enjoyed the character development and the seriousness of the manga. If you watch shounen and can handle the story then just know everything else is pretty much too their. The animation, and the sound are among the best there is and I don’t thing anyone can straight faced disagree with that. If character growth is super important to you, than at least watch the movie and or season 2 whenever it comes out before you write off the characters. This is an enjoyable show and regardless of how much people hype it up over “influencers” tweeting about it, or the people hating it for the sole purpose of it being too mainstream or the fact that it’s too popular, I will say plain and simple it’s great. Unless unfotable screws it up ( yeah right) this will almost certainly be a classic, this will land on the top shounen of all time list once it’s said and done. There is too much to love about this show and personally I cannot wait to see things really kick off in the coming seasons.",10,Venom0723

                What can I say about this anime ...? This is a masterpiece for me. It has brilliant graphics, but as we all know, it doesn't matter that much. They're just so good I can't help but mention them.
The story is very intriguing. From the very beginning, the anime starts hard. You see how the main character, Kamado Tanjirou, leaves his family for a short period of time and when he returns they are all killed by a demon without a single member. This member is not just anyone, but his little sister Kamado Nezuko, who, to Tanjirou's great misfortune, has become a demon and is
                  trying to kill him. As they fight, a seemingly unimportant character appears, Tomioka Giyuu, who saves Tanjirou and thinks it's right to kill the demon his little sister has become, but despite the scene from before, Tanjirou is against it and defends her little sister at the cost of his life. This dramatic moment awakens Nezuko's soul and she also intercedes for her brother. Tomioka Giyuu decides to believe the words of the two young people and sends them to Urokodaki Sakonji, who trains the young Tajirou in the basics so that he can pass the test for joining the ranks of Demon Slayers. You will probably wonder why he does it? He does this so that he can find a way to get his sister back in human form. There is no point in explaining what happens next, because I should have already won your attention, or rather you should have already played the first episode, but let me finish.
 Remember when I told you that Tomioka Giyuu seems minor at first glance? Well ... He later became one of my favorite characters in this anime.You will see why when you watch it. Tanjirou and Nezuko go through many difficulties together. Nezuko even has to pass a relentless test to prove that she is different from other demons. Anime has its own style. One of the few animes that made me really smile as I watched, thanks to Agatsuma Zenitsu. Anyway, so far with the anime episodes. 
It's really worth watching and I recommend it with both hands up. It even ends in a very promising way, and by ""promising"" I mean it promises Season 2. After a little research I did, I saw how long the manga lasted, so there's enough material for Season 3, even Season 4. There's only one thing I don't like and it has nothing to do with the anime itself. I'm annoyed that the reviews at the top aren't that good. They explain the anime as simple and straightforward. that there's nothing deep in it, even though these are only the first 26 episodes.Wait for the next seasons to release and you'll get the depth you want.",10,TheEternalHunter

                This anime is a freaking masterpiece.
Honestly,the art style, the fluidity of combat is AMAZING! How they show the lightning style, water style and others is so cool. The story is the same as other anime of this category where humanity's survival is threatened and the mc joins a force to bring peace or some other motive.
Its got a decent story with great art and fluid motions and some fair comedy.The combat parts is something to look forward to. It's really great.
It's got some some cute moments and dark moments too. The main character isn't like others that you see who go on killing the other
                  creatures with no sympathy or no feelings or quick death or some painful way. But here the main character realizes how they feel, understands their past life, the stuff they went through and kills in a almost a painless way even if it is with a sword. Not like quick death or something but in a way where the bad guys or the demons kind of die happily or are at their happiest moment. I know this must be sounding crazy but I don't have any other way to say this. It's like knowing what the other person has went through and relieving them of their suffering in a beautiful way(I DONT MEAN KILLING'S BEAUTIFUL BUT THE WAY THE MC DOES IT THE DEMONS ARE AT THEIR HAPPIEST AND MOST PEACEFUL TIME) even though he is just killing them.
You'll get what I am trying to say after you watch it.

                I've just watch 7 episodes but I think it's Must necessary to do a review of this.
from the first Episode I've seen i got instant Attack on Titans vibes from it after watching it considering how brutal that Anime is and how it doesn't even have a safe zone which means anything can happens so if you're a fan of that Anime then this Anime is a must watch for you .
the story here is really interesting and kept me on my toes for all those 6 Episodes that I've seen so far unpredictable and bloody events with the mystery surrounding it making this plot
                  probably one of my favorites .
Action scenes and the Animation and artwork all really great and everything looks gorgeous to look at .
also one side note : i really love the connection and the relationship between those two siblings the main protagonist and his sister really eager to find out how things will end up for these 2 .
overall i really rarely gives a high rating but this one really deserve a solid 8 / 10 might consider giving it a higher points in the future with more Episodes out .",10,MysticGod

                While the show is certainly a visual treat, it lacks originality and depth of character.
While the show began slow, it's worldbuilding and atmosphere were two great points going for it. But the atmosphere slowly morphed as we piled on more characters, and the show slid into a more traditional, and uninspired, battle shonen. The interesting characters are few and far between, with standout annoying performances (the two sidekicks especially, are walking tropes taken to extremes) which completely destroyed the earlier feel of the show.
Kimetsu no Yaiba is a decent, if unoriginal, battle shonen. If you like these kinds of animes, the visuals alone should keep
                  you entertained as it is by far its strong suit. The animations are normally great and sometimes downright gorgeous with effective use of colors and CGI to create some scenes that truly stand out from more mundane shonen scenes. 
It's a technical achievement if anything. I can hope for bigger and better battles in the future of the show, even if I now know what to expect from its mediocre at best storytelling.",5,SevenTales

                Well, admittedly I actually struggled considerably even getting myself to watch this series. The impression I had was that of an overhyped, relatively generic shounen- devoid of the elegant nuance I usually seek from anime and manga. I was of course incorrect in that assessment and I believe that to be emblematic of how this community can sometimes spur people towards judging something on things it isn't attempting to even do. 
Demon Slayer is just a lot of fun. Though, its lighthearted tone fluttering throughout most moments never really got in the way of some timeless thematic representations of various aspects of the human condition
                  for me personally. It's all balanced super well. Grave situations/emotions gives way to outlandish comedy rather quickly and at times even takes place closely together- it just sort of always refreshingly worked for me. Koyoharu Gotouge (the mangaka) wisely included quite a few characters with experiences rife with elemental characteristics of different types of people and how events in life can affect them; I considerably enjoyed realizing the author understands many different types of people well enough to include so many believable characters and reactions from them. 
When one character says to another, ""I guess..the voice in your heart is really tiny"" or "" Hey, that doesn't matter. Since you helped me out, you're part of me now. And I'm carrying all of your emotions onto the battlefield with me!"" surrounded by the context that makes those lines relevant, they serve as examples of how a writer can voluminously imbue authentic reminders of certain things we as people could do well to reflect on for awhile, all in a few short lines or so..well, that to me is valuable in art. 
I could go on about the great animation, and how I as a 28 year old graduate student enjoyed the reprieve of comedy others might disparage as childish or unrefined, or how Nezuko is adorable and Chuntaro is best girl- but none of that or the other things I don't have much more time to mention seem necessary for me to elucidate my main point. 
Demon Slayer does what it tries to do entrancingly well from where I was sitting. Sure, there're things I could draw attention to which weren't all that perfect in my assessment- but what's of critical importance here is I genuinely don't think any of it got in the way of me being enthralled with watching a show I was almost positive would've been underwhelming. Lotta fun and looking forward to the movie premiering in the US and reading the manga past the anime. But really Chuntaro is precious",9,ShaneOmac27

                a month or two before i officially started the anime i read the manga since one of my friends had suggested it to me.
i was in the er reading this manga and this is the first time i had ever read anything by the author Gotōge (only to come to find out this is their first work)
i fell in love with the story itself fairly quickly, i am a family person so i quickly fell in love with tanjiro with doing everything he could to help his sister so she could become human again. 
after catching up to the point where the anime ended i
                  binge-watched the entire season in a couple of days, and ufotable did animation beautifully and did each scene justice (except a few) but I will say this.
had it not been for the breath sword skill animations(and nezuko), I doubt this anime would have had so much hype.
yes this animation is incredibly beautiful but let's be honest, had it not been for the extremely amazing animated action scenes, I doubt most people would've continued it. who'd want to see simple demon-slaying with just cutting and moving here and there while shouting,""Breath of Water!""?
and let's be honest nezuko is the ""it"" waifu for 2019 at the moment, had it not also have been for nezuko's adorable desgin i doubt people would've continued it. don't get me wrong she's absolutely adorable and i love the cute caring nature she has but, there is such a thing as overhype, even though she gets much more to her in the manga, it's her simple ""hmphs!"" that has everyone watching, and it's like??There is more to a character you know? but the anime community loves their waifu wars
anyways those things aside i do highly suggest this anime(the manga more so than the anime) it's got a good story, good animation, and good characters. it knows how to make you laugh and cry!",10,moonlight-ana

                The shounen genre has seen a great deal of evolution in the past decade. For the last 10 years, shounen writers have strove to make their series the next big thing, and many have succeeded in different ways. The shounen genre stays true to its common tropes of heroism, hype battles, and, of course, what I like to call “dick-measuring contests”, because it always seems like there is a competition between characters to see who is the strongest and the main protagonist usually has full-fledged ambition to become the strongest. Whenever there’s an extremely powerful character at one point, another even more powerful guy comes
                  along. There’s always that need for writers to break the limitations of their most formidable characters, usually to extend the life of the series. Anime like DBZ and Naruto are pinpoint perfect examples of that.
People say that this genre is mainly aimed at the teen and young adult demographic, but to be completely honest, I believe that this genre has gone far beyond that point. I’m 22 years old, and I still enjoy shounens depending on what they have to offer. Yes, I always expect the common tropes that come with the territory, but what I’ve been seeing lately is the fact that most modern shounens always include something unique, fresh, or exciting in order to gain your interest and hold it until you’re finished watching. You had the anime Hunter x Hunter, which drove itself on its masterful character development and writing. My Hero Academia drove itself on straightforwardness, including its fast pace, spectacular action, and positive ambition. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood drove itself on emotional impact and flawless character development. Attack on Titan drove itself on intensity and subversion of expectations. The shounen genre is virtually no longer something that should be aimed at a specific age demographic, because nearly every shounen has that something that sets it apart from others, giving them their own identities that can attract a multitude of anime fans regardless of age.
Kimetsu no Yaiba was an anime that was destined for popularity simply because it’s a shounen, and anyone who has first heard of the anime from the get-go drew their attention to one word: ufotable. This studio most notably known for their contribution to the Fate series, namely Fate/Stay Night UBW and Fate/Zero. Ufotable was praised for their animation and visual design in both installments, and even though Fate is a series that I don’t see being talked about often, ufotable still made a name for themselves through it in which that recognition would work its way into Kimetsu no Yaiba. I went into the anime with zero expectations except for the fact that I knew it was from ufotable. In fact, before I started watching, I had no idea that it was a shounen anime. I practically figured it out 2 episodes in. 
Like any shounen, the premise of Kimetsu no Yaiba is simple. The anime takes place in a world that’s ravaged by demons (not demon spirits, but basically just humans turned into monsters with special abilities) that feed on human flesh. The story follows a young boy named Tanjiro, who finds his entire family and village killed by demons, with his sister, Nezuko, surviving the onslaught but has turned into a demon herself. Seeing that Nezuko can somehow resist the urge to eat humans, Tanjiro goes on a journey to become a demon slayer and hopefully find a cure to turn Nezuko human again. 
Remember when I said that I figured out that this anime was a shounen 2 episodes in? Everything about the beginning of this anime was a dead giveaway. Right off the bat, we have a protagonist who is ambitious to train himself to become stronger in order to accomplish a specific goal. This should be the trademark trope for the entire shounen genre, but because of it, I was afraid that I would end up turning away from the anime. Yes, this is a shounen anime. I watched the whole thing, and I can honestly say that the story itself is nothing new. There’s nothing unique about what the anime does with its characters that separates it from other shounens. If there’s nothing unique with the story or characters, then why do I obviously have an extremely positive opinion towards it, to the point where I just slap a 10 on it?
Directing, novelty, and pacing. Remember when I mentioned how shounens have something that drives their stories and gives them their own identities in turn? The things that drive Kimetsu no Yaiba are its directing, novelty, and pacing. I have many reasons to slap 10s on certain anime, and I’ve done so with quite a few. Even when I know of their flaws, if the aspects that drive their stories are impactful enough to raise my level of excitement and interest to the point of blowing me away, then you get my vote, whether it’s an 8, 9, or 10. They’re different levels of enjoyability, but those numbers are all highly positive. With Kimetsu no Yaiba, I was expecting the anime to only get worse, but I was seeing the opposite. Every episode, it just kept getting more and more exciting to watch. Let me explain how it handles its 3 aspects:
Directing:
An example of a shounen anime that has very good directing is My Hero Academia. While its shounen tropes and flaws are obvious to the eye, the directing is what makes it so fun to watch. The writer of the anime knew exactly what it was: a superhero anime, and was bent on keeping it that way by making it uplifting and heroic. In the case of Kimetsu no Yaiba, the impact value from its directing revolves around beauty in a treacherous world-build. This anime is violent and menacing, yet it is still one of the most gorgeous and attractive anime I’ve seen. One of the best examples of how beauty is implemented in its story is through the villains of the series. The demons aren’t evil just to be so, which is how they are made out to be at first, but later down the line, you realize that they are all sheep who slave away under a single person. They’re evil because they have no choice but to be so, and the way the anime directs every villain’s backstories and hardships generates sympathy for each of them. Almost every villain death is shown in highly artistic fashions, in both explosive (i.e. Zenitsu’s kills) and slow, tranquil (i.e. Tanjiro giving a soft death to the spider girl) manners. 
These critical moments left a huge impact on me, because I rarely see anime present violence in a way that can be seen as beautiful rather than simply brutal and harsh. The way the anime is directed through its treacherous world-build immersed me further into the ride. It made me care more about the characters like they were real people, and this is considering the shounen tropes. Yet, the next two aspects also apply to the directing:
Pacing:
This anime is extremely well-paced in nearly every aspect. There is no part of this that is rushed or tedious, and pacing is something that many shounens have an extremely hard time getting right. This is another thing that the first season of MHA did so well. If it was going to be an anime about superheroes, the focus of it was directed more towards its action than trying to conjure up a deep and complex story (which is also something I think an anime like Sword Art Online struggles at doing). MHA had a focus and it stuck with it, which is what Kimetsu no Yaiba also does well in a similar fashion. This anime is focused mainly on its artistic drive through the treachery and dangers of its world. It builds itself on intensity and keeping the viewer excited and hungry for more action. Action sequences are very well-placed throughout the anime to the point where it rarely slows down, because even in its slow moments, I was always hyped to see more action and more beauty.
Novelty:
The animation, the music, the action choreography… they’re all spectacular. The pacing in the fights are excellent. They are all extremely tense and fast-paced, and every single one did better than the last. It seemed like whenever there was one incredible fight, the next fight outdid that and so on. Ufotable makes utilization of every single strength under their belt, including the unique art, use of CGI, and spectacular visuals and special effects. The art in this anime really stands out, especially considering how two-dimensional and flat the characters look, yet the way ufotable seamlessly makes them blend in with the more three-dimensional environment is incredible. The soundtrack is fantastic, and is composed by the legendary Yuki Kajuira. I’ve been a fan of her compositions since the first time I watched Sword Art Online. She is incredibly skilled at writing music that you’ll turn your attention to while watching an anime, which is something that’s hard to do for a lot of film composers. Compositions are mainly meant to be background music, but a multitude of tracks in Kimetsu no Yaiba don’t fade into the background like they’re supposed to. They simply stand out so much that they give me the initiative to keep an eye out for a soundtrack release. 
Kimetsu no Yaiba is not a perfect anime in any way. You may believe that the anime doesn’t deserve the perfect score, even if you are positive towards it, but I rate anime based on my enjoyment of them and not by how perfect I think they are. I know fully well that Kimetsu no Yaiba is very flawed, yet it has the drive that heightened its impact value, and there are so many moments throughout that blew me away. This is really all dependent on how I viewed the anime. I may be exaggerating my descriptions in this review. I may be making too much of a big deal out of it, but hey, I’d much rather make mountains out of molehills than miss out on some worthwhile entertainment.",10,Mcgillacuddy

                Kimetsu no Yaiba or rather Demon Slayer is a shounen about a boy named Tanjiro who seeks to turn his demon sister Nezuko back into a human by reaching the source of the demons. Muzan Kibetsuji. 
Story (8): 
This may sound like a typical shounen by the plot synopsis, but throughout the season it expands and gets better by each episode and by the end of it, you'll be begging for more episodes. The plot us unique, ""a boy wants to save his sister and avenge his deceased family by killing the source of his sisters demonhood/families murderer in hope to make her human again.
                  It works well and it's an engaging plot. 
Art (10): I mean honestly, this shows art/animation direction are absolutely breathtaking. All characters are vibrant and full of color. Each characters moveset boisters stunning detail and animation that will cause your jaw to drop. Same can be said for the demons blood arts. Landscapes and backgrounds range from being full of life with a happy mood to being dark and evil feeling. It adds so much tension in the right moments and it knows when to lighten things up depending on the atmosphere. Ufotable knows what they all doing.
Sound (10): The sound design is incredible as well. From the sound of swords coming out of there sheathes, too the sound of the instruments used within the anime. It adds a whole new depth to some scenes, especially near the end of episode 19, which is an amazing episode.
Character (9): Our main cast of protagonists are Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke are all so different from one another. Tanjiro is just a normal boy who isn't overpowered and he knows that, he's very human, selfless and will do whatever it takes to save his sister and defeat any demon that threatens them. Zenitsu is an odd ball for sure with his split personalities. Most of the time he is scared of everything in the most hilarious way, he gets easily jealous when girls talk to Tanjiro and sometimes when a demon is in his way, his mood completely shifts and he becomes a powerful demon slayer, a side no one knows about, even himself. Inosuke is a competition freak. Everything revolves around him. He loves being loud and will fight too the bitter end and hates feeling inferior to others. Nezuko harbors the look of a demon but the heart of a human and she will not attack humans. She will fight for her brother Tanjiro at the right moments. In my opinion the best arc in this season is the Demon Family arc with Lower Rank 5 Kizuki Demon Rui. Amazing.
Much more can be said about a few of the Hashiras including Shinobu and Giyuu but you need to watch this show. 
Enjoyment/Overall: (9):  To me this show felt like a breath of fresh air with Ufotable at the helm. It makes me even more excited knowing there is a movie releasing next year to continue the story, (Infinity Train Arc) and maybe season 2 will release in 2021. If you love a shounen with lots of action, character building, cool and interesting demons as foes for our protagonists, with a great engaging plot, give this anime a go. I absolutely recommend it.

                This is one of the best shonen i have ever watched. I feel in a shonen anime story isnt everything.  
Story: 7.5
it has a pretty solid story and develops well. There is no lag in the story. It is pretty predictable but again this is a shonen , so having a predictable story isnt wrong. People call demon slayer story horrible writing, they are wrong!!! Its not horrible. Why do people except a show like AOT all the time. It is actually a bit different from classic shonen. Usually the protagonist wants be or achieve something so that they can become stronger. But
                  here thats not the case. Tanjiro is someone who didn't know demons existed and had his family slaughtered but his sister turned into a demon. His only aim is to just live peaceful life and save his sister. He dosen't want be pirate king or hokage or hero. And this anime has very less plot armors unlike classic shonen. In the manga the writer didn't hesitate to kill characters. Really unique in its own way as a shonen.
Character: 7 
Character development was not bad, we get know each characters back story be it a demon slayer or a demon. The story has just started and it is too early to judge. I already watched the demon slayer movie and it was amazing. So we have to wait for season 2 to get to know more about the characters.
Sound: 10
Amazing sound effects. The flowing water sound and the sound tracks are amazing.
There is no mistake in any sound effects. Sometimes u feel like ""this scene could have been better"" but for me it wasnt like that. 
Art: 10
U cant see a better shonen anime for me in terms of art. Its just too good. Ufo table have done an amazing job. Ep 19 was one of the best shonen anime episode i have ever seen. it not only blew me away with the animation but also the effect it had emotionally. It shows the bond between these two sibilings that is very hard to break. If people complain about the flashbacks i dont care. Most of the shonen animes have horrible amount of flashbacks. It is also later explained that these flashbacks come when a person is on verge to death. Ufo table did a better job in the mugen train movie in terms of art.
Enjoyment: 9
Be it the serious moments, Sad moments or funny moments i really enjoyed this show. it is really good and enjoyable for me. Prople miight have over hyped it, but if a show is hyped it dosent mean it is bad.

                After seeing these pictures and memes all over social media I decided to finally take a look into Demon Slayer (Kimetsu no Yaiba). I came with many many doubts and prejudices only to be wronged in so many goddamn ways. Demon Slayer was a whole other ride.
Story: (7/10)
Our main character Tanjiro lives a quite pleasant life with his mother and siblings until one day he comes home to find his family slaughtered by a demon. The only survivor, his sister Nezuko, was turned into a demon. Tanjiro now tries everything to become a demon slayer himself to get revenge on the demon who killed his
                  family but most importantly turn his sister back to human. 
Demon slayer is your typical shonen anime. That doesn’t mean the story is bad per se but is by no means unique or new. The plot itself is good enough to keep you attached and interested tho and it has its own twist here and there. Overall I enjoyed the pacing and storytelling.
Characters: (9/10)
I’m actually not a fan of shonen myself because most of the time I get annoyed with half of the cast (looking at you Naruto, bhna, etc). But with Demon Slayer its different. Yes Tanjiro is your typical shonen character: optimistic, dedicated, selfless, calm and just lovable. I’d usually hate him because he’s supposed to be  this dumb, naïve cliché protagonist… but he ain’t. Despite his optimistic self you won’t ever see him acting dumb or careless for others, he has a mind of his own and he uses it. and holy shit he is badass.  I don’t want to go on talking too much about Tanjiro even tho he is probably one of my favourite shonen protagonist but there are so many characters besides him that are insanely well written.
Our second main character is Nezuko and despite her having like one line in the whole series, you can’t but love her. She’s just way too adorable. (Can’t wait for a 2nd season to show her badass demon side). Other than those two, we get introduced by some other characters, the most important ones being zenitsu and Inosuke. Zenitsu is rather plain and boring characters, crying over girls and fearing everything  (he gets more interesting in the manga later on). Inosuke is your… not your typical character. I tried comparing him so someone but I just can’t. Wearing a boar mask and two katanas, he stole from a demon slayer he runs around trying to fight anyone he meets. After getting smashed by Tanjiro he follows him around, always wanting to fight him again to prove he is better. Compared to all these kind and nice characters he is the perfect fit for the main group of characters. 
Character development isn’t lacking either and already in the first few episode we see Tanjiro evolve and develop some ground. Other characters sharing their amount of development as well. For characters like Nezuko and Zenitsu we will have to wait as we approach their insane  development in the manga.
Art & Animation: (10/10)
Demon slayer has by far the best animation I have seen in an anime. From the tense fighting moments to landscapes and even the funny moments in manga style, it just fits. There are no such things as static images, low effort fighting scenes, etc. The scenery is simply breathtaking and even though I’m not really into 3D animation Demon Slayer did an insane job mixing up 2D with a few 3D animations. Tanjiros waterstyle feels so smooth and is just beautifully animated. The fighting scenes gets you hyped everytime, its insane. Big probs to the studio, this animation and art style is top notch.
Soundtrack: (10/10)
With Gurenge performed by LiSA we get greeted by one of the best anime openings of all time. It simply fits and manages to give me goosebumps every single time I’m listening to it. It’s a banger. The ending is really good as well. What stands out is the stunning, exiting music coming with every single fighting scene. It has been a while since I got hooked by an anime like this. But the music and animation work so well together its impossible not to cheer for your favorite character. I had to calm myself down sometimes because fighting scenes got tense to the point where I just wanted to scream my lungs out.
Conclusion:
Demon slayer has by no means the most unique stories or characters. The anime ain’t perfect but it is close as hell. The Animation as well as music makes up for the rather generic storylines and the characters get such a deep and interesting exploration throughout the season, you feel yourself falling for the whole universe. I’m not a shonen fan by any means and I went into this anime with really high doubts. I’m glad to be proven wrong. I fell in love with almost each and every character to the point, I immediately started reading the manga after finishing the anime. That’s why I have to give demon slayer a well-deserved 10/10. I highly recommend you to look into the anime yourself, even if it doesn’t seem to be your cup of tea.",10,ParzivaI_

                Alright so I am noticing that at least the top comments for this show are all from people in about May who had only seen 7 or 8 episodes by that point. The anime although was still extremely good back then, it does not even come close to comparing to what it is now. 
The fighting and the development of Tanjiro and Nezuko is taken to a whole new level to the point where they aren't even just protecting one another now, but able to fight as a well oiled machine exponentially increasing both of their strengths. 
The animation of course is amazing and the
                  voice acting is as well, but the animation really does shine in episode 19, the latest episode, probably one of the most beautifully and well done fight scenes of all of anime. I cannot remember a time that a fight scene has left me in awe and goosebumps for so long, I just can't seem to stop myself from watching this one scene over and over again. It was so good that I may even say that watching the anime is more than worth it just to see this scene. The ED that they used for this scene as well just made it even better, in fact without the music I dare say that the fight scene may have just been amazing instead of spectacular.

                *No Spoilers. It has been 6 months since I finished Demon Slayer. I've watched about 100 animes since then and now, I think I can review it. I decided one summer evening to watch anime. I chose Kimetsu no Yaiba because I heard it was good. I only watched My Hero Academia, Season 1 of Sword Art Online, and about 60 episodes of Fairy Tail. Other than Ghibli movies, I had no anime experience. I watched it and was completely engaged with the characters and art style. I didn't hear anything about episode 19, but when I finished it... I fell in love with the
                  medium that is anime. I was watching Kill la Kill and Ms. Kobayashi's Dragon Maid at the time so, I didn't have that much to relate it to. But...It changed me. I was a typical gamer before then. But I became a full on weeb. I binged about 20 more series throughout the rest of summer, 70 series in the fall, and now I'm already 15 series in this winter.
*Now to talk about the actual show.
STORY: 8
I think the story is really solid. The first episode sets us up for us to root for our main characters: Tanjiro and Nezuko. The following episodes set us up for the rest of the series teaching us about the upcoming threats and battle system. Overall solid and enjoyable.
ART: 9
The art is amazing in this show. The art style is unique compared to other animes, and the animation from Ufotable is some of their best. (I still haven't watched much of the Fate series.) The camera work is masterful and the effects for the attacks are really beautiful. Almost like someone is attacking me with ocean waters straight out of a painting. I also really enjoy the choreography. Highlights are the the arrow fight, drum fight, and episode 19 fight. Overall... amazing job Ufotable!
SOUND: 7
I love the sound effects for the attacks, and the ost can shift from beautiful, all the way to hype. Buuut... I feel it wasn't the biggest muscle that was flexed compared to other animeIt was never bad, but I never felt the need to gush about it. I do think the voice acting was really good. I watched it subbed.
CHARACTER: 8
I like almost all the characters. ZENITSU!!! (Sigh) I liked his backstory, but I thought he just a creep and wuss for most of the show. He displayed a lot of character when he protected the box and when he finished his final battle, but other than that. I guess he was fine. Other than that, likeable characters, and amazing designs.
ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 9
I love Demon Slayer. It will be in my heart as the kickstarter for my weeb days, and I thought it was very well made. I am proud to call this one of my favorite animes despite how normie it now is.",9,Copyboy-13

                ""Turn your brain off""...
...is a phrase that is commonly associated with shounen anime and it's a phrase that I hate. If you have to turn your brain off to enjoy something, then that thing is a waste of your time. Since turning your brain off is a prerequisite to enjoying most shounen anime, I've generally avoided properties licensed with Shonen Jump. Hero Academia is a big exception, but that's because it's a show that you can hardly avoid (probably like Naruto and Dragon Ball in their own times). I actually love that show, which is the main reason why I was willing to give Demon
                  Slayer a shot.
So, how does Shonen Jump's newest cash cow stack up? Actually, pretty well.
Don't get me wrong. The writing is just okay. It's littered with tropes and it doesn't set itself apart in any way. For my own sake, I didn't go into this shounen anime with high writing expectations. Instead, at the very least, I expected to see some masterful fighting animation. After all, that's where all of this show's buzz is coming from (as well as the oni-waifu). And I'm glad to say that I saw the magic. This show's animation is stellar.
What can I say. The animation is simply amazing. It may seem off-topic, but I swear it isn't: when I watched this show, the episodes didn't feel like they were 24 minutes long. While watching this show, time seemed to flow by without my knowledge. Before I knew it, I'd watched 16 episodes in one sitting. I can safely attribute that to this show's pure visual quality.
Usually when I watch a show, I end up getting exhausted from silently nit-picking every frame where a character is staring off into space or whenever a character is moving unnaturally choppily. These flaws don't largely exist in Demon Slayer. Almost every scene in this show has the animation quality of a good anime fight scene. It felt like nothing was unintentional- even when it  didn't necessarily matter. 
More importantly, though, the fight scenes... I mean... Words can't really do them justice. The only flaw that I could see in the fight scenes lied in the generic nature of each protagonist's attacks. If the choreography was on-par with My Hero Academia, then this show would have been an easy 10.
So, yeah, Demon Slayer is awesome. It's not the best show I've seen, but it's really good. I'd Recommend it.",9,ShaIIot

                Demon slayer: kimetsu no yabai is an actual work of art, and forever will go down in anime history as being one of  ""the greats""
the story is a typical revenge plot, MC ""tanjiiro""  finds his family hurt, and goes out on a revenge path to find the one who hurt them and the one who possessed his sister, along the way  he finds numerous friends and allys, and of course horrifying enemies ""demons"" with godly powers, each one more stronger than the last
the art style is absolutely stunning. It uses the perfect blend of CGI and Hand drawn animations. Not one character
                  uses any cgi or 3d models *to my knowledge* , nor does any one use of CGI stick out horribly like a sore thumb  *like most cg aspects usually do*
the fight choreography is also just as stunning, seeing the liquid like flows of their swords slashing through heads,the twists and turns to avoid attacks and so on. Each demon has unique powers and fighting styles,  no two demons have similarities. *except maybe the spider family* 
the character design is kinda typical. It has the overpowered MC, younger sister he wants to protect, lazy best friend, and super show off shmuck that  thinks hes better  when he clearly isnt,  but it all oddly works out for this show.
overall i give this show/series a perfect 10/10, maybe a 9.9, 
as im not  a big fan of a show building up a super awesome storyline, just to say ""FIND OUT IN THE MOVIE"" i wish they could have progressed it more
but apparently the story arc for the movie is also one of the best arcs in any shounen  manga of all time, so i am also hyped for the movie
TLDR; this show is a work of art, super solid art and animations, story, choreography all of it",10,Brianiac

                I started watching this because LiSA sang the opening. Cutting to the chase: This is a simple, yet great anime.
The story isn't very complex (so far) and everything is well-explained. I felt like the pace was a tiny little too fast a few times but nothing grave: one time it was because of a timeskip of two years, so all is good here.
Character introductions? Made sense, nobody came in ""unexpected"" - that is to say, unrelated and out of space.
I'm kinda missing a little more complexity here, so the story gets a 7 (good) from me. There also were a lot of funny scenes!
The artstyle
                  takes a little getting used to - they all look like kids, even if they're adults. Personally, it was a little of a downside for me because I'm a sucker for good looks. I would also say it has a good aspect to it too: it made me focus more on the storyline.
Each of the characters is uniquely designed. Their facial shape may be the same, but the eyes aren't. Their eye design differs greatly from each other, if you compare.
The animation? Chef's kiss, very nice with some 3d elements, very smooth. I particularly liked the Water Breathing Technique's animations.
Sound 10 of 10 because Gurenge as the opening? Perfect. The OSTs were great as well, very fitting, got a vibe of past Japan.
All the characters are nice, well made. Certainly not perfect but that'd be boring anyway. There is a lot of room for character development for certain characters.
I liked the dumb main trio very much. They all seem a little bit of stupid but all three are different kinds of stupid. While Tanjiro is dense, Inosuke has exactly zero percent of human competences Zenitsu always seems stupid but that's because he whines so much. This trio is very dynamic. They fit each other well.
Another aspect I like about them is the healthy rivalty they've got.
I really enjoyed this series throughout and it's definitely worth the watch. I'll stay tuned for another update!",9,Guiltena

                spoiler warning for the weak minded
Just about anyone who has had any interest in the action and adventure genre may have come across the monomyth aka the hero’s journey. A term popularized by Joseph Campbell about a common narrative template that has been used through many ages and cultures of stories about heroes and adventures. While it has been argued that the monomyth and it’s details are considered too broad and general that it can fit the description of almost every story. It didn’t stop people from accepting the idea of the hero’s journey and integrating them into their own works. In some way the
                  popularized use of the hero’s journey in modern writing helped retroactively legitimize the hero’s journey, if it hadn’t been already. Now comes Demon Slayer which is the latest to follow the template of the hero’s journey and does it to a t.
Demon Slayer doesn’t wear the hero’s journey on its sleeve but more so is the sleeve itself. By just grabbing an image from any search engine about the hero’s journey will provide a good road map of where the show will go. As the show follows a young man named Tanjirou living a normal in the woods with his family. However one day when he returns home he finds his family slaughtered and the only survivor being her sister, Nezuko, who became a demon. Despite being a demon she still retains some of her humanity that stops her from attacking her brother, and it’s that humanity that gives Tanjirou hope that he can cure his sister which becomes his call to adventure. He is given supernatural aid by a man who is in the Demon Slayer corps who is initially met with hostility as he tries to kill Nezuko, but then relents due to Tanjirou’s perseverance and gives them a chance by directing them to a man who can help them. As they go to meet the man they are faced with a moment where Tanjirou refuses the call, because in order to continue the adventure he must become a demon slayer. This becomes a problem due to Tanjirou’s nature as he finds it difficult to kill another being, even if they are a demon, nonetheless he decides to join for his sister's sake. The man they were meant to meet becomes the mentor figure for Tanjirou and puts him through many trials and training in order to prepare him for his adventure. With the Selection exam finally allowing him to cross the threshold and become a demon slayer, allowing him to journey deeper into the supernatural world. And that’s all the narrow examination i’m going to do as the point has hopefully been made, which leads to the grander narrative.
Despite following the classic hero’s journey story, Demon slayer is still a Shounen Manga and like most shounen manga it is long running. Demon Slayer is in the more moderately long side when compared to other manga in it's demographic, and it's only halfway through the first triple digit of chapters. With such a long form of storytelling in order to not stagnate to long on a certain point in the journey, stories such as these tend to do repeat certain points of the journey again in a different form or adding new parts that they didn’t use before. It makes the journey less of a complete circle but more so arcs of varying degrees. Story arcs that have as well been a main aspect of many long formed series especially in shounen series. Demon slayer for the most part has two major arcs. The first one stretching from episodes 1 through 10, and the second arc for the remainder of the season with a bit of the 3 arc at the tail end. While having story arcs aren’t a bad thing in capable hands, they sometimes tend to feel disjointed with the tiniest threads connecting them together or worse, being detours and a waste of time if they offer nothing of substance. Demon Slayer does fall into one of these categories, but luckily it’s more the former than the latter. Thanks to the magical bird of plot convenience taking them not only from one arc to the next, but also from one location to the next. With each one conveniently being more tied to the plot then the next. Anything else about the story is standard action shounen fare with a couple of hiccups. It has an evil group/organization with a x group of members that are fought in more or less ascending orders, It has a group of well trained warriors who help the protagonist along the way, and so on and so forth. None of it helps or hinder the show, which is something I can't say for the characters.
Tanjirou basically carries this show for most of the season. He serves as a good main protagonist for the show and is better than most shounen oriented protagonists in general. He still shares traits with many of them by being a bit loud and hot headed, but it doesn’t come as annoying due to it not being his defining characteristic. The same goes for his intelligence as he isn’t portrayed as too smart where he over analyzes everything but he isn’t dumb back of rocks either. What defines him the most is his level of compassion towards others, even his enemy. He’s still able to fight and kill demons like any slayer but that doesn’t stop him from feeling sorry about them, which is usually missed by other slayers. Tanjirou certainly isn’t a complex, nuanced, or even iconic character, but what he does have makes him endearing. His sister Nezuko however could have used better treatment for her character. Anything that could have made her interesting is neutered. Dialogue? Put a bamboo in it. Personality and internal conflict? Hypnosis. Screen time? In the box she goes. It’s truly a shame especially in the moments when the show tries to reinforce this idea of their sibling bond, but their lack of having much character dynamic holds back those moments that could have had a lot of impact. 
Then there is Inosuke and Zenitsu two other demon slayers that the main character meets along the way. Inosuke is a belligerent bi-shounen boar boy and is the more tolerable of the main duo mostly due to the fact that he gets some development. Going from a loud very aggressive person who does things by himself, to being less aggressive and is willing to help out with others. He also doesn’t scream as much, but i guess that’s due to the fact that someone squeezed his neck once really hard. Zenitsu on the other hand is harder to warm up to. He is a coward but that’s not the problem but more so what branches off of it. 1st is that Zenitsu’s coward personality serves as much of the comedy for the show as he is sort of a comedic relief character but it’s less funny and more annoying. 2nd is that he doesn’t develop much as a character or at least it’s aligned with the fact that his development is inside him the whole time and he has to go to sleep to unlock it. 
As for the other characters. It’s hard to say. The other demon slayers that have any relevance are the pillars, the veteran warriors, who are like the captains and commanders you would see in other shows. They are the most tropey of all the characters but that’s mostly on their character designs and limited screen time and dialogue. The demons also get little characterization, only a tragic backstory to make them somewhat sympathetic. The only one that gets a bit more than the rest is the final antagonist of the season, but it’s really not much. 
Demon slayer also boasts great production value all around. The soundtrack is great and it accompanies the show very well. Sporting both orchestral and traditional Japanese music that range from the slow and sad, to the loud and triumphant. And at times both intertwine to create a beautiful symphony. There’s also the choral singing that brings a mysterious and supernatural feeling to the show. Not to mention the mention the abundant use wind instrument music that along with the singing compliment the show which focuses on the character having breathing control in order to fight properly. Of course some tracks do fall to the wayside,but it doesn’t detract from how great it is overall.The art for the show is really good with striking character designs, use of color, and thick use of lines that lends to the visual appeal. Also the fact that it’s done by ufotable that gives their shows a certain polish that adds a beautiful flare to the animation and action scenes. However it still has some moments that bother me to some extent. While it’s true that the CGI is better than most other shows due to how it’s used, it still has a few blemishes here and there. This also carries on to the metaphysical attacks that the demon slayers use with their attribute appearing from thin air. They do look great and it gives them a nice visual flair but sometimes they look weird especially with tanjirou’s water version as the “foam” still lingers on screen for a bit more and just looks weird. Finally i’m not a fan of shows changing visual styles for the sake of comedy or at least very few do them right and demon slayer isn’t one of them. Nonetheless, the combination of its sound and arts is a sight to behold as it sweeps you off your feet and makes it easier to forgive the bullshit power ups this show has.
Demon Slayer is one of the more decent shounen oriented series to come out in a while. While it does play safe in terms of storytelling, it’s still serviceable for the average viewer. I just wished it was as beautifully done to the same level as the visuals and audio of the show. This is a show that I would happily like to see a continuation of, with the hopes of improvement. Maybe then the show can ascend to greatness that the show wants to be.",6,LaLeLuLiLo

                (WARNING: May Contain Spoilers. I will label spoilers as the review goes along)
This is my first review ever
Demon Slayer is like watching art being painted on a canvas. It's natural beauty makes this show amazing to watch. 
Story: 7/10
The story of Demon Slayer is extremely interesting, but isn't necessarily unique and complex. There is a simple yet effective resolve from Tanjiro that drives the plot forward. This simple resolve plus the world around Tanjiro makes the plot move in a way that isn't bad, but doesn't have an unique setting. The resolve itself is not unique, as FMA:B has the same endgame, but ultimately does
                  it better. While the plot itself is good, it does not feel unique, but is boosted based on characters. The development of how Tanjiro becomes a Demon Slayer is developed well enough. The plot itself is developed well, however, it is a simple plot and resolve that don't make it unique.
Art: 10/10
Ufotable outdoes itself in regards to art. (spoiler) Episode 19's clean transition from water to fire style is extremely well done and so clean (spoiler end). The slices of the sword feel so real due the clean animation. The use of motion tracking in some of the episodes make it so much more interesting. The landscapes and scenery itself is breathtaking, and it shows itself in Episodes 1-4, where the wildlife is so vibrant. It uses its animation to push the story. Zenitsu's use of his style is so rare, yet it looks the cleanest of them all. Giyu's unique style is like watching art unfold behold your eyes. The character designs themselves are unique, yet are amazing. The characters emotions are fully displayed by their animations and facial expressions. I heard from somewhere that it's like watching art on scree, and I can agree
Sound: 10/10
The sound of Demon Slayer is unique but beautiful. To start, the OP created by the legendary LiSA, is one of the best modern OP's I've seen. The OST""s themselves are amazing. They fit the emotions for their sole purpose. When there are emotional scenes, you get hit with the piano or the flute, with hard rock scenes you get hit a guitar, and of course, the creepy scenes use that choir that fills the air with eeriness. When they all mix together, it is some of the most impactful pieces of music that move you, for no reason. The music choice is superb throughout the story
Character: 8/10
The characters in this story are engaging, entertaining, and likeable. To start, the Main Character himself has a resolve that is simple, effective, and obtainable. Compared to Shoneon tropes where one wants to be ""the king"" of something, Tanjiro's resolve is not for selfish purposes, but to help the others. His comprehension and sympathy for others far surpasses other MC's. His character is written very well and mature for an MC. Then we have Nezuko, who's character is fascinating and loveable. The fact she's able to comprehend humans who are good and her family despite her being a demon makes her a great character. She can help herself but also help others. Her empathy and caringness despite the condition she's in makes her a great character. Of course there are the two sidekicks, Zenitsu and Inosuke. Zenitsu is a more developed character, and his backstory is so interesting. Of course he is used as comic relief for most of the time, but his serious moments do engage the audience. Insuke is arguably the weakest link, as his behavior is only barely justified and he doesn't develop, thus leaving him an one dimensional character used for comic relief. While there are other side characters that I truly enjoy, such as Giyu, Shnobu, they don't get enough screen time, but add to the depth of characters. In regards to the Demon, I believe they are the weakest part overall. The demons resolve is unclear. While some demons have interesting backstories, some of them fall flat. The main villian does not show clear intent at all through the series and leaves me confused. However, the Demons that Tanjiro fights are somewhat interesting to see, especially Rui, who is the most interesting Demon. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
I enjoyed this show for it's interesting world building, the likeable and deep characters, the good and comprehendible plot, and the impact of the art and sound, left me engaged and loving this show. I did enjoy this show a lot and how things played out
Overall: 9/10
Demon Slayers unique art and amazing sound, the likeable characters, and comprehendible and good plot make this show very interesting and a great watch. It's simple complexity keeps me craving more of this show.",9,Kalyteros

                For the past two seasons of anime, I've had the pleasure of watching Kimetsu no Yaiba, for me, there was never a dull moment. My first time watching the opening, and seeing the art, I thought to myself, they surely can't consistently have artistic and animation quality of that level right?
Story: The show grips you immediately, places you in the shoes of Tanjiro, who lives in the mountains with his mother and siblings. He takes care of his chores to help the family survive; gathering wood, trips to town to sell and buy goods for the family, etc. One day, he returns to find his
                  family brutally slaughtered by demons, the only one clinging to life, his sister, Nezuko, this begins their journey. While searching for a way to turn his sister back into a human, they become entrenched in the demon slayer corps, and their battle against not only the demons, but against Muzan and the twelve Kizuki as well.
Art: Man, it's good. A little too good if you ask me. It leaves me questioning whether or not UFOtable can keep up this level of animation throughout the full length that this anime ends up running. I'm not very artistic, nor do I have a ton of knowledge of the techniques, but whatever technique they use for drawing the elemental breathing technique stuff, is absolutely breathtaking. It makes the fight scenes stand out from every other anime in my opinion- because it hasn't really been done before, at least not at this level of quality, as far as I know.
Sound: They hit you in the mouth right off the bat with the kickass Gurenge by LiSA, and the music choices throughout the show always fit the mood, and felt incredibly cinematic. The voice acting was spot on as well, you could generally feel the emotions when they were present. 
Characters: Man, the cast of characters in this anime, was outstanding. Of course, you have Tanjiro and Nezuko taking the lead, but, they did such an amazing job of making every character that joined the fray have their own personality and emotions, generally from their past. You don't find many animes where they genuinely make you feel for almost every villain that's encountered along the way, but they made it happen with this. It played to the idea that ""maybe demons aren't all bad"" because you had moments in their deaths, where you could see the very human side of them. It was incredibly well done.
Enjoyment: As someone who works weekdays, this anime made my Saturdays even more enjoyable. I was able to roll out of bad after 10am, plop on the couch, and allow myself to get lost in the story that is Kimetsu no Yaiba. I consider this a Spring anime, because of when it started, so, it easily took the cake as my favorite anime of the Spring, and that carried over into the Summer as well, although, the competition was quiet a bit higher in the summer IMO.
Overall: 10/10 easy. It's uncommon when I have an anime that just gets a 10 in my mind with little to no thought behind it, and that was the case here. It just felt so obvious to me that it was a 10, with just how much I enjoyed this show. I look forward to the movie, and hopefully numerous seasons to come.",10,SCUBAST3V3N

                Demon Slayer is one of the greatest animated series I have ever watched and I recommend any fan of Shounen anime to give it a watch. It has a great plot, loveable characters, beautiful animation and an amazing soundtrack. Every episode left me hooked for the next one and many left me with my jaw dropping or laughing numerous times so I'm going to review why this was a great show and why you should watch it.
Plot:
Demon Slayer is set in a period of Japanese history which is often overlooked, the Taishō period. This was a period in history where Japan had very much modernised
                  but rural and traditional lifestyle was still not uncommon which makes for a very interesting setting where we can have 20th century technology along side katanas which isn't something you see everyday. As you can guess by the name of the show, there is demons and there is demon slayers who slay them. The demon slayers themselves are unrecognised by the government and operate more in rural areas meaning a lot of people are unaware of the demons. Our main protagonist is Tanjiro Kamado, a young boy from a poor family whose whole family is murdered by a demon except for his younger sister, Nezuko. Nezuko is turned into a demon and Tanjiro joins the demon slayers in hope of finding a way to cure his sister. I won't spoil anymore of the plot since its worth a watch but thats the general idea.
Characters:
Compared to most Shounen anime Demon Slayer has a pretty small cast, there is four main characters and each of them do a great job of representing different aspects of the world in this story. Tanjiro is one of the greatest protagonists I have ever seen and he is a great role model as he is extremely kind and is willing to do anything for his sister and his friends. Throughout the series we see him motivate others through hard times as he has been through very hard times himself he is very understanding of others. Unlike a lot of Shounen protagonists he is not overpowered and sustains great damage in battle which have long term effects. The rest of the cast also is very representative. Nezuko shows a lot of courage and love to go against her instincts to help others, Zenitsu represents the fear of people and his view of himself as an ordinary guy against the more courageous demon slayers and the demons themselves is interesting. Inosuke shows how there is much more to just believing that you can win which overall I think is a great part of this anime, how it doesn't rely on friendship and other bullcrap and actually applies logic while still showing how values are important. The characters all have their own quirks which allow for fun moments too though some may find it obnoxious which I can understand I think the balance between humour and seriousness is done very well. The rest of the cast is enjoyable too though some may think the pillars are boring with one line personality traits though they still need to be developed next season as I also thought the same of Tomioka and Shinobu until they were developed more.
Animation:
This is definitely the shows strongest point and it is why it became so popular. The animation is done by ufotable which is a phenomenal studio most know for the Fate series. I'm not usually a big fan of CGI in anime but here it looks absolutely breathtaking. I've rewatched many of the fights numerous times because of how clean they are. Episode 19 and 26 in particular look phenomenal. The art style is very distinct but it doesn't look out of place at all, the backdrops and environments look beautiful. Many effects are used which I haven't seen much in anime before and it is very surprising how good they look especially for a TV series.
Soundtrack:
It's amazing, the opening and ending are great songs which get you hyped up for the episode and the one after especially considering the great cliffhangers this series has. The background music is beautiful too, it uses a variety of instruments which really feel like you are in that time period. The battle music, the more upbeat music, the peaceful music... it all sounds fantastic. My favourite track has to be the music from the end of episode 19, I can't help but smile when hearing it during the action.
Overall for me this show is 10/10 which is not something I say often but I was really captivated by it and it hooked me early on. If you like Shounen anime you should really check it out.",10,Maykii

                Story 
demon slayer story's pretty simple.there are demon slayer who slays demons and there are different ranks of demons and then there is the originator of the demons aka the boss level demon but what carries the show is the reason for the people to become a demon.What happened to them that they decided to hate the society this much to even become a demon and kill others and how her sister will be cured.
Art style 
oh boy the art style is soo good on the points that it carries the show forward.An awesome job done by ufotable :]
Sound 
i found this anime through its
                  music.its goddam good not only the music but the sound effect is as good as the music is :}
Characters
i like mc  of this anime.He is different he knows what has to be done, has to be done right there.He do sure understand the pain of others even of his enemy,he feel sorry for them but he knows he has to slay them he does not  do this out of revenge but to free the demons and the things which happened with him does not happen to anyone else and also to turn her sister human back again ^^ 
As for the other character some are funny but at times they get annoying too but those moments gets balanced by some badass moments by these annoying characters :')
Conclusion
i like the anime for its art style ,characters,music,sound effect,and interesting backstory of poor demons and slayers
i would recommend this anime for those who like the things i mentioned :"")",10,NubPlayz

                (This is my seconde review, and the first one was really cringe, so please be gentle :) )
Demon Slayer is not overrated.
I gotta admit, I didn't have such high expectations when I started watching Demon Slayer (plus I didn't read the manga). Honestly, I was kinda scared to the idea that this could be like, I don't know, a basic ecchi (I was fully aware of the Nezuko fanbase, guys she's like 15) or just a sequence of too many arcs, not really linked to each other. I was wrong, and I am going to tell you why :
Story : 8
A young man, who wants
                  to cure his demon sister, and occasionally slaughtering every single other demons in his area (yeah, it looks like a certain type of ad, and I don't freaking care). As simple as it looks, it is surprisingly good. Like I said before, each arcs have its own background, its own characters (even if Tanjiro remains the MC), its own particularity. Moreover these arcs remain connected, in one way or another. The story becomes more complex, and it makes the anime pretty decent on this point.
Art : 10
I'm going to be really quick and unoriginal about the art : it's absolutely stunning. Demon Slayer has the best art I have ever seen in an anime, especially during the fights scenes. Watch it, and you'll understand.
Sound : 9
I want to be honest with you, usually I don't pay attention to sound effects or music, because I find it very basic in most of the cases. But damn, that's not how it worked here. The soundtracks in Demon Slayer are completely different from the modern music we can hear in another anime ; we feel, like, an ancient Japan atmosphere (the story is happening during the 1910's). Another time, our anime stands out from the rest, for the better.
Character : 9
I think there are 2 things that define a good anime character : first, how far can it go without being annoying, and then, of course, its development. What can I say except that almost every character has an unique development ??? The further you go, the harder it becomes to say who is the best girl and who is the best boy. If I had one advice to give you, think carefully before judging anyone.
Enjoyment : 10
You enjoyed the first episode ? Congratulations, you'll enjoy the rest. Just like me !
Overall : 9
After such a favourable review, it seems evident that I consider Demon Slayer as a really, really good anime. Thanks for reading !",9,Vety

                First thing i will say thankyou is to : Mrs Koyoharu Gotouge because him we can see the wonderful story of masterpiece.
And the second i very say thankyou to the studio who make this series so hype : Studio Ufotable. I very merging to watch this manga adaptation in all aspect. So i will give some review about aspect that i merging for :
Story : (10) the story of KnY very very unique. All of story have continous thing and tidy plot. The story not just focus in Tanjirou as Main character, but make focus in all aspect in character (this make me feel so
                  ""wahh"").
Art : (10) for art, we don't need to ask anymore, ufotable is the greates studios until now to produce the best act. they make every frame/picture so details and we know, ufotable is greatest for this case.
Sound : (10) nah, in this aspect i very very like. if i can rate this through 11, i will give this aspect rate's 11 from 11 (because this rate just until 10 hehe). ths ost, opening, and ending designed very well, especially in the ost. (By the way i very like the battle ost of KnY). for the opening and ending, we dont need to ask how LiSA perform's. She always perform in 100%, so that can make the op and ed very very good. But again, the ost will make you get goosebump.
Character : (10) : in this aspect too make me fall in love with KnY, because the character in this series is unique. Almos all of character in KnY have sad past. and i very like the character development like tanjirou from weak until he strong and other character.
Enjoyment : (10) if you need to enjoy your self after you got tired in work, you can watch this series. this series contain has a comedy side, have a little romance, and almost the great action and adventure is very well mix in this series
Overall : (10) for Overall, i rate this series 10 for sure.",10,KennySultan

                this is my first review thank you for being indulgent
first the scenario of Kimetsu no yaiba has nothing really remarkable it is in the end quite classic without big reversal of situation, nothing that makes him stand out from the lot. Tanjiro’s objective changes from that of the other classic shonen, the goal of our hero being simply to find a way to retransform his sister into a human, (the one or mainly that of the other shonen neketsu is to be the strongest). The anime regularly speaks to us because/thanks to this objective of family relations and confronts several visions of the family with
                  that of the other characters. This is for me what makes Kimetsu no yaiba differentiates itself from other anime, personally I had never seen before a anime talked about family relations this is perhaps why it marked methe characters seem to have a very thorough development, I hope that all the characters will have the right to a development.
Next the graphics of kimetsu no yaiba are very beautiful, (even if one could have thought that ufotable would have done better). The animation is just sublime, (probably one of the most animated anime I have seen). The style is quite clean a kimetsu no yaiba, (despite that this style really looks like that of other ufotable anime). The touch brought to the sword technique really make the whole beautiful (like the zenitsu lightning).
The seiyuu voices are good, (I didn’t really pay attention). The sound effects are also very good there is not really anything to complain about, the most important point of kimetsu no yaiba is the OST that is just amazing, (the composer being Yuki Kajiura,) all ost are a real pleasure to listen to, (my favorite being the Zen'itsu theme). The only regret for ost is that the one that came out the most is that of the famous episode 19, which is for me far from being the best. The opening is really good (probably one of the only ones I like among those of singer Lisa, the ending is also very cool even if it is less good than the opening.
The characters are interesting, some already have a good development, to see in the sequel if the others will have one as well, but I do not think that all will have a development. The chara design is really original, the most part are very colorful with colors that I rarely see in other anime (like the yellow of Zen'istu).
What I like the most about this anime is really the ost, (Yuki Kajiura being probably my favorite composer it’s pretty logical). The animations are also really sublime (episode 19) the graphic quality is really beautiful, there is no personal that is zero they are all interesting, and brings all something to the anime is contributing to make Kimetsu no yaiba one of my favorite anime (shinobu <3).
However the scenario is not really transcendent, of the story in itself also it is in the final quite classical, the world of kimetsu no yaiba is really cliche, (people who fight with sabres and ""powers"" that make (almost), that fighting really reminds me of my opinion about anime before I start looking at it. (And this image is according to it's probably in the worst that we can give to anime in my opinion). And this is probably the image that people who do not watch anime have anime
To conclude Kimetsu no yaiba is not good because the scenario is good, Kimetsu has made talk of him because it is pleasant to watch the animations are probably the best that have seen him for a shonen neketsu the ost are sublime is this is what makes us go into the anime (the animation and the ost allowed me to see the most epic anime I have ever seen)",9,Haikazan

Keep this quote on your brain, cause yes: this will happen basically anytime on the anime. I'll not coil right there, so let's start.
Story: 10/10 [SPOILERS]
So, I'm not actually sure what was the last shounen that I saw in my life (I think it was attack on titan, but only the 1st season or something), but I only started to watch this one because a lot of people didn't stop to talk about this show. And yeah, I know: Kimetsu No Yaiba is overhyped as fuck. But, to be honest, I really don't give a single f*cking
                  care about it. If the anime is good or not, that's the only thing that matters. I started to watch because a lot of people reccomended to me, so why not? And this one is also a unique case, cause: I was advised that, on the plot, there's a very slightly spoiler of the 1st episode. And when I heard that, I was automatically thinking of not reading the plot, because I wanted to feel the real tension of the 1st episode. But, only by hearing the people talking about, I already knew the general things of the show, like: there's demons, there's swordsmans, there's the protagonist, there's swords, there's powers, and etc. The story of Kimetsu No Yaiba (or Demon's Slayer) takes place on Japan (on the Tasho's age), where we have the protagonist Tanjiro Kamado, that lives isolated (on an house, in the other side of an mountain), and in a poor family. One day, in order to help in the financial conditions, Tanjiro decided to go to the city (in the other side of the mountain), to sell a lot of coal to the citizens. And on the next day, coming back to home, Tanjiro was facing the worst situation ever: his entire family was dead by the forest demons. The only survivor was his younger sister Nezuko, but unfortunately she turned to an demon too, but in an specific case: she didn't want to eat human flesh (she turned to an demon by the main villain: Kibutsuji Muzan, but after that, all humans are considered ""family"" by Nezuko), and she can't eat them (and yes: Nezuko only can recover energy by only sleeping a lot). With that, Tanjiro decided to pass by a very hard trainment, to be part of the ""Executors' Squad"": to go to a lot of missions, kill a lot of demons, in order to avenge his family and find a way to make Nezuko turn back to an human. So, yeah the premise looks generic (it looks like it will be another classic shounen or something), but the way the things are shown is very unique. Because, as usual, we have a lot of demons (which are villains on the anime), but the majority of them were also humans, that had stories, had lives, and something. And because of sufferings, pains, and compilations, the majority of them were turned to demons by Muzan (due to their pains that they had). And when they die, they basically are sent to the sky, with thie sins forgiven. And yeah, with that, we also have some refferences with, at least, three animes (as my brain can remember): 1st - Naruto: because yeah, wanting or not, there's some refferences to japanese culture, like: the use of kimonos, hashis to eat, the japanese cooking, the japanese religion (that can be identified by the Kagura's dance, made by the deceased father of Tanjiro, that always practice the dance to amaze pains and suffers from his family), and etc. 2nd - Akame Ga Kill: and yeah, there's who says that Demon's Slayer is an remastered version of akame ga kill, but it's not. Well, surprinsgly, I still didn't watch this show, but it's possible to fin some similarities, because we have the villains on both, and on both, the majority of people die (but the only difference is the emotional appealing of both: on Kimetsu is sadder, on Akame Ga Kill I can't say, but I think it's not on the same way). And 3rd - Angel Beats!: damn, this one also has some similarities too, like: the fact that we have sins on both animes (and like: characters that wanted to do some things, but they can't, because the life time is over, and that brings to them a lot of pains), etc. The only visible difference is: on Angel Beats, we have characters (already dead), and on Kimetsu No Yaiba, we have characters (on the same situation), but turned to demons (as the anime title suggests). Also, as I said: there's a lot of emotional appealing. Due to that fact (when the demons die, this is like a redemption), because we know about their stories, and we can identify ourselves sometimes with them. When I finished, I was like the Inosuke's voice actor: crying in the corners, specially with the Rui's story (to be more specific, the spider demon guy; the bottom five of the twelve kizuki). Because Rui was a child, with the incapability of walking and do almost everything. Unfortunately, Kibutsuji (seeing his suffering), he turned Rui to an demon (because in all the time, Rui was like blaming his parents, by the fact of being full of defects). And when he turned to an demon, after devoured his parents, the last words from his mother and father were: 
""I'm sorry Rui. I'm sorry for didn't give you a perfect body, but we did everything to make you happy as far as possible"".
DAAAAAMN. His story just got me, and yes I cried so much with that story. I was sobbing so much. The saddest story on all the anime for sure. And I'll talk about the life lessons on the final section (overall). But, summing up, I really liked of Kimetsu No Yaiba, because the story leaves no loose ends, and explains literally everything. Really caught me: I laughed so much, I cried in some moments, I was short of breath (because there was a lot of moments that my adrenaline levels went crazily high), I was goosebumpy in a lot of scenes, and I got enchanted by almost everything. It looks a little bit ponderous, I know. Because we have a lot of bloodthirsty scenes, and deaths, and somethings. But, at least for me, this wasn't a problem. Clearly my heart hurted in those scenes, but I think that they were presented to show how the real human suffering can be. So, 10/10 to the story. REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY AMAZING.
Art: 9/10
It's from Ufotable, so what can you expect? Well, basically: an stunning and uniquely amazing piece of art style. I mean: this is about Fate franchise. Because, I only watched the Fate/Stay Night seasons produced by Ufotable, and damn: the art of Fate is simply unique. It's so f*cking detailed, so real, the traces are basically amazing, the colors, the characters design and the scenarios are simply genious. And about Kimetsu No Yaiba, I think it was really so good as Fate series, but I think: we can't deny that Fate's art style is light-years, compared to Kimetsu. But Kimetsu is also very good too: I like the characters design of both; I like the CGI of both (and to be honest, they are the best animes with CGI use); I like the scenarios of both, and etc. But, on Kimetsu No Yaiba, sometimes, the art style looks more simple. Don't get me wrong: the art of Demon's Slayer is also fantastically amazing, but if you compare with Fate, it'll look more simple. Like the traces looks more childish sometimes, but they're very good too. And we can make some good hecking desktop wallpapers with the backgrounds and with the characters (and I think this will be a trend for years, because this anime don't stop to be so popular, even if it was launched like one year ago). So, the art is pretty great: the colors are so good, scenarios so good, characters design so good, the traces and the brightness so good, and all the fight scenes were very very well animated (I got goosebumps everytime I saw the fight scene between Tanjiro and Rui). But again guys: we can't deny that the Fate's art style is light-years better. But, overall 9/10: it's also uniquely great too.
Sound: 10/10
10/10, and nothing less. Because, I really love the opening and the ending songs so much. The opening song (Gurenge), what can we say? Fantastically amazing too, like: it really gave me goosebumps literally everytime. LiSA is a very great singer at all, she didn't deserve to ""Autotune"" her voice, because she already have a great, excentric, and beautiful voice. The scenes that appear on the opening were very choose at all, the fast takes too. And with the ending, we can several wallpaper compilations to our desktops, right? The ending was also so good: the song, the scenes that show more about the Tanjiro's family. Yeah, sometimes I really wanted to go back, to just repeat the songs, because damn it's so addicting at all. The background soundtracks were amazing too. We have the right soundtracks on the: sad moments, on the fight scenes, and on the funny moments. The most addcting funny soundtrack was the background soundtrack on the Taisho's gossips scenes (after the final credits). And on the goosebumpy moments, there's always the best choices of soundtracks, to pass to you: a even bigger air of tension and despair. And yes, I liked of that. So, 10/10 to the soundtrack. Do you have the courage to say that the soundtracks are bad? I think not.
Characters: 9/10
Really amazing too. *cof cof* Zenitsu *cof cof*........ LOL, okay I'll explain that later. So, summing the four main the characters:
- Tanjiro: easily one of the best protagonist on all the shounen animes,  have a very good keen sense of smell, very courageous, funny, sweet, and sometimes, you'll have the willing of putting him inside of a little pot, due to his mood and cuteness at all;
- Nezuko: the cutest demon girl on all the anime;
- Zenitsu: one of the most annoying characters ever, yelling everytime, not so lucky when it comes to be attractive to girls, fearful, but funny at the same time;
- Inosuke: the guy with an boar mask, that always chase Tanjiro (""I can do anything you do'', it's basically like that lmao), lives isolated, have a very good mood, and very funny too.
And we also have the Hashiras (the nine most powerful characters on the anime, along with their master: Kagaya Ubuyashiki):
- The bug pillar: Shinobu Kocho- The fire pillar: Kyojuro Rengoku
- The water pillar: Giyuu Tomioka (and yes, I laughed so much when shinobu was bullying him, saying some things: ""no one likes you"", ""you don't have friends"", and etc. And the way that Giyuu reacts to these comments is so funny at all. I cracked with laughter so much, and this is also a meme too I think).
- The love pillar: Mitsuri Kanroji
- The wind pillar: Sanemi Shinazugawa
-  The snake pillar: Iguro Obanai
- The sound pillar: Uzui Tengen
- The rock pillar: Gyomei Himejima
I'll not coil too much with the characters, but I'll give my general opinions: 1 - Shinobu is definitely the cutest girl on all the anime (I don't know if this is an unpopular opinion or not), but while Nezuko is the cutest demon girl, Shinobu is the cutest standard girl or something. And again, speaking about the characters, again: I need to quote the demons (the villains). Specially about Rui, and probably the demon with tsuzumis (with drum around his body), I slightly shed some tears, but again: the story of the demo family (spider demons, Rui) just got me every time. I including identified myself with him, but again: I'll talk about the little life lessoes that we can take with it. The worst character is, no doubt, Kibutsuji Muzan, because you know: he's like a scumbag, that even kill or mistreat his followers, which is something that pains my heart (by only talking), and something that will make you hate him forever. But the characters are a very strong point on the anime (and yes: I'll talk about why I don't give a 10/10 to Kimetsu No Yaiba, on the overall section). For while, I give 9/10 to the characters: very well constructed, and you'll find yourself sometimes.
Enjoyment: 9/10
Overall: 9/10
So, summingup everything I already said: Kimetsu No Yaiba is definitely a plesant surprise, coming from Ufotable (the studio that, until my brain remember, only produced some animes of Fate series). So, I think that they decided to rummage in the coffin, and finally wake up for life, with the objective of producing something that will impact the whole world (and they got it as always). Kimetsu No Yaiba is, no doubt, the best anime of 2019: something that automatically (less than 1 year) turned to an high-grossing anime: big success, and a very fast formation of a large fanbase are the characteristics of Demon's Slayer (or Kimetsu whatever). Anyway, definitely a must-watch anime, that I reccomend to anyone. So, you're probably wondering: why I gave 9/10 not 10/10? What life lessons can we take? Well, I think I didn't give a 10/10, because of Zenitsu. Damn,  I mean he's so annoying in all the senses, he yells so loudly, but he's funny at the same time. But I don't know: I didn't give 10/10, because I think that there was something missing to make it a 10/10, like some element, or most probably because of the ending of the last episode. And yeah. I finished the last episode of Kimetsu No Yaiba, now I'm crazily anxious to watch the movie. Because the last episode show a very quick scene of the beginning of the movie (Infinity Train). I wish I would have luck to watch the movie on Japan, now I'll need to wait 5 or 6 months to launch worlwide. GODDAMIT!!!! If someone have the movie (with subtitles or not), please give to me bruh lmao. Cause I really want to watch, and yes I'm very curious to see what will happen on the movie. DON'T GIVE MORE SPOILERS, PLEASE!!!! I was already warned that Rengoku will die, so don't give more than that please. The second thing: What life lessons can we take? Well, the lesson that we need to valorize the family that we have, because seeing the entire Tanjiro's family (and a lot of blood around) pains me everytime, because we can predict the future, right? So, we need to valorize the family that we have (in relation to intimate relationships, and etc.), because the next day will probably be a new story (we don't know, right?). So, this is something that hitted me so deeply. And something very curious about Demon's Slayer is: we can assimilate the actual show with the actual pandemic situation, right? Like, in the both the worlds, we have a lot of people dying, and a person that don't give a single f*cking care to the deaths (on the kimetsu's world is Kibutsuji, and on the real world, are the actual f*cking stupid presidents of EUA and Brazil, right?). Take me as an example: I live in Brazil (not that surprinsgly), and this is so hard, because both kibutsuji and the actual f*cking brazilian president we have the willing to kill both of them. I know: this is very very heavy (looks heavy), but it's the truth. Both of them doesn't care about the actual pandemic, and they are like: f*ck the dead people. So, can you see the actual similarity? Okay, I really don't want to enter in political things, but this is necessary to say. So, yeah, I'm just giving 9/10 to this show: very very amazing, it really intrigued, because I felt some things that I didn't feel for a very long time, and I'm really happy that I returned to the shounen world. Can't wait to see the movie, because I know: with the movie, my adrenaline will go crazy too, and I definitely can't wait to cry on the movie theather, with the death of Rengoku (even if I know that this happens, I'm already prepared to cry tho, I'm gonna take some tissues to the movie theather as well). So, 9/10: amazing characters, amazing story, even if there's some things missing (and we have the annoying Zenitsu, that I think I can feel good without him yelling in my ear), overall: it was amazing, and it was a perfect example: of how shounen really need to be nowadays. Anyway, a pleasant surprise, that will definitely stay on my heart forever (full packing with emotions, laughs, and goosebumps as well). Thank you guys for reading until here, and have a nice day. Stay home, and stay protected from corona plsss. Bye guys!!!",9,tomioka_hashira

                In the past 5 months, I paused from watching anime and reading manga. Kimetsu no Yaiba meme flooded my newsfeed those days and it was indeed a struggle to avoid spoilers. Thankfully, I have teaching preparation and research to distract me from renewing my full-pledged otaku status.
Anyways, many weabs dub Kimetsu no Yaiba as ""Anime of the Year of 2019"". After watching, I would like to echo the words of a friend who said, ""It's more like the 'animation' of the year."". 
Basing from the Fate Stay Night franchise, Ufotable has a solid track record of slugfest on-the-edge-of-your-seat animations. Ufotable studio delivers the same top-notch
                  quality in Kimetsu no Yaiba, including the art style wherein their trademark lunar antics consume much of the screen time. 😂
The story is alright. It's not bad; it's okay. It is a typical shonen anime where the main protagonist has a protagonist trait. I mean, all throughout the episodes, Tanjiro screams to the audience ""Hey guys! I have ENFJ qualities."". The female lead, Nezuko, is the lovely object in the franchise who works like a charm because it's not anime without a kawaii element. As usual, the sidekicks -- Zenitsu and Inouske -- are stupid in their own way. My favorite character, so far, is Shinobu. #YandereIsLove 😁 Towards the end of the series, following the trend of many shonen pilot seasons, Tanjiro slowly established his harem and we do hope that his keen sense of smell will not make him as dense as Ash of Pokemon or Asta of Black Clover. The demon-versus-demon-slayers universe was also clearly set up, in the end, leaving some mysteries with a cliffhanger that builds the hype of a possible next season(s).
To sum up, Kimetsu no Yaiba is a lovely ride. Maybe not that great compared to many anime of higher taste, but it was indeed a perfect reentry portal for fans who took a break from watching this type of entertainment. Should I read the manga now? Nah, I don't think so. The animation is so great -- at par with AOT or Gintama -- that I want to save the surprise in video format. Surely, this is something I will recommend.",10,Humabon

                I should literally be giving this show a 9 or 10 rating but I'll explain why not in a bit. 
This show at first didn't look very exciting, typical hyped new show...damn was i wrong. Off the bat the shows hits you with deep feels, some great combat and a good sense of what you can expect. The story literally puts you in an emotional ride, seeing both the struggle of the main and those before him. 
Combat is great, alot of neat and omg moments, and we get one of animes cutest character. Now THE MAIN REASON WHY I GAVE IT A LOW SCORE...
We
                  are introduced to one of the most annoying, stupidest support character thus far. For a show about literally survival of the strongest and power beyond those of demons...why is Zenitsu here??? 
I really hate shows that contradict what one must be, you have those that are strong, mean yet mysterious, calm yet deadly...then you get this...personally i despise it, was bloody tough jus getting through the show without me dropping it. Really wish they drop that trend and not put annoying supports there...again just my opinion. Great show thhough.",6,KirbyWurby

                Phew. Just finished watching the 19th episode and boy was I impressed. 
When I began watching the show I had low expectations since it gave me the average sword man anime feel. The beginning was kind of slow and the show changes a lot after Tanjiro sets on his journey. For the better of course.
I always enjoy when characters struggle and overcome their fears and weaknesses, and this show is filled with that. The characters are mostly likeable but I didn't really like them being used for a comedic effect in the middle parts.
However this is redeemed later on with the characters becoming more in
                  depth and developing in the story. 
I love all of the action scenes, even though they follow roughly the same premise. 
In those action scenes the art and animation really get you feel to for the characters and make you cheer for them. 
I also love how the attacks have an impact in every fight. With this I mean how good the sound design and animation empower the attacks. 
Talking about sound, the soundtrack and music direction is fantastic.
Nezuko is the only character I don't really like and she gives me some sister anime vibes. 
Overall a great anime. There are countless emotional scenes and they really nail the character development. Hoping for a season 2.",10,Bloooop

                One of the best animations i have seen in a anime by far.
First of all the story is great and i can't wait to see some more and for him to progress towards his goal. I mean i just love how the story is it hooked me right in and i just couldn't stop thinking about it also it never seems to leave out character backstory which is great because i can get a feel for nearly every character and the animations are just amazing honest to god i have never seen an anime with such good art.
Overall i would say if you love anime
                  with amazing battles, amazing story, and amazing animations you must give this a watch",10,LIDLWIPE

                When it comes to strong start and being dragged right into the story, this anime easily sits at the top. Starting of with some beautiful artwork and goes straight to the action involving the main characters so you want to continue to see how it plays out, the consequences are what builds the story of the anime so you have to keep watching. The main character has a different goal than the others around him that he keeps a secret giving a perfect structure of main character.
The early parts keep to character, world and plot building.
As the anime continues the pacing slows down but the
                  plot keeps developing at a good rate and takes on a more light hearted touch which is still really enjoyable. The show adds more characters and integrates them into the plot nicely using the new characters to also world build.
This season of the anime wraps up nicely ending where it started and leading perfectly from the movie which follows this season. 
The Story is simple ""protect the cute girl"". But seriously the main character is invested himself because of his sister (you are invested causes she is cute). Which I feels different from other Shounen because the main character isn't driven by wanting to become the best but for an active family bond that we see grow throughout the anime which is a lot more relatable. 8/10
OH MY GHAD ufotable what is this? This is not longer animation this is an Edo period masterpiece. The Art work is fantastic it has got crisp drawings with I will say the best by very very far colour palette. The contrasting colours the flowing liquid-like animation is perfection.  From the studio that brought you Kara no Kyoukai the blend between animation and CGI is the best ever to hit the stage. The dynamic scene blow any and very other anime out the water, they fit the actions scenes perfectly and there has never been a better fix and I will say a long time before we see such wonderful artwork and CG crossover again(although the movie has yet to come out). 10/10
Sound is secretly one the best things this anime has to offer. The breathing, the gentle snow crunch, the rolling water and flicking flames in pull you in the world, even if don't want to be there. The soundtrack is one of the memorable out there ever scene and piece are meant to be together. There are very notable names in voice actors that really bring there characters to life. 10/10
Every Character in this anime is extremely developed each of the main case with their own little back story and it reflects their personalities so well, the way they interact with each other keeps the show well ground considering how intense the characters and their personalities and experiences can make the show at times. (also cute sister) 8/10
An Enjoyable show all together I wasn't expecting to be dragged into this anime so much and I just couldn't stop watching, I loved the characters and the story which worked together perfectly and complemented by beautiful artwork and sound makes it extremely good fun to watch. 8/10
Overall there is no way this anime isn't one the best upcoming anime series' it's few flaws can be easily overlooked by it's overwhelming amount of strengths. I thought hard is this an 8 or a 9. Is it really up there with ""your name"", ""Sound Euphonium"" or ""Angle Beats"" and I have decided it is. This season was fantastic and well deserving of a 9/10",9,i_have_scurvy

“The weak have no rights or choices. Their only fate is to be relentlessly crushed by the strong!” – Giyu Tomioka
Party is over... nope party just begun. Kimetsu no Yaiba or The Demon Slayer, took the
                  shounen world by storm this season and shounen trash fans out there just can't wait to take more hits from this addictive drug of an anime. Just to put it in perspective, if Naruto and DBZ was heroin, SnK and OPM was codeine, BNHA and MP100 was fentanyl, then Kimetsu no Yaiba by studio Ufotable is definitely carfentanil. That's how potent and addictive of a series this show just is. It follows the shounen formula perfectly but just executes it at a breathtaking level through their beautiful eye-jizzing animation and pleasing eargasmic OST. This anime has the potential to be anime of the year so let's take a closer dive to see what sets it apart, why you should watch this & whether it really is deserving to be the anime of this year! 
""I swear your big brother will save you no matter what"" - Tanjiro Kamado
From a story perspective, Kimetsu no Yaiba is very simple with a clear end goal. Almost all shounen anime tend to have such a trait and as well all know it's all about the journey not the destination. The show starts off with Tanjiro's family getting brutally murdered by demons and the only surviving member is his little sister, Nezuko, sadly turning into one. So Tanjiro must go out on a hero's journey to turn her sister from a demon back to a human. To do so, he must become a demon slayer, these pseudo samurai-esque warriors that are trained by former Hashira's, slay demons to figure out a way to learn how to cure the demon disease. They can only be killed by sunlight or decapitation by a special sword. Early on, we learn that all demons were once a human and they became demons due to ultimate villain Mujan Kibutsuji, who is the father of all demons. He is the only one capable of turning humans into demons so the main hero, Tanjiro, must kill him to rescue humanity from the demon epidemic. Very simple structured story, not too many twists and turns. The show progresses well with its powerlevels as well. Powerlevel refers to how fast a hero gets powerful enough to beat other villains. Too fast and it becomes unbelievable, too slow it just becomes boring. However, given it's simplistic structure, the show did became very repetitive in the middle with the whole crow sends you on a mission, demon appears, demon gets slain. Rinse and repeat. Thankfully, due to each demon, showcasing different power, we get to see different fighting styles and see our hero learn, use and adapt the training regiment he went through to become a demon slayer. One huge positive for the show is the way it layers the story and builds the stage for the character to shine during battles through use of flashbacks to justify their actions. There are gag skits here and there that gives the viewers break from constantly being on the edge of their seat but at times it feels like they drag it on a just a bit longer than needed. Lastly, there is a precipice point in the show where till you reach it, it's just an average shounen anime story, and I'm sure you know which episode I'm referring to since it was all over youtube and twitter, but afterwards, the show really finds its footing and gives new breath to the boring monotonous story this shounen anime was turning out to be.  
""Don't ever give up. Even if it's painful, even if it's agonizing, don't try to take the easy way yout.."" - Zenitsu Agatsuma
Now that we have a good understanding of the story, this show would not be vastly enjoyable if it weren't for the characters. Seriously, each of the character in the show is very well designed and their characteristics just makes them unique from each other. From the main protagonist, Tanjiro (Naruto), who despite being a demon slayer, due to his past, empathises with each demon he kills to the peak imouto, Nezuko, she taketh headpats, she giveth headpats to the awesome quirky polar opposite side characters Zenitsu (Sakura), the sleeping giant, and Inosuke (Sasuke), the best boy/girl? This show has a dynamic cast that keeps on giving as we get to learn deeply about each of their past and the struggle it took to become who they are now. Keep in mind, this season barely scratches the surface on the complex lives of these characters and their past and in future season, definitely there is more in store for them which will make them better. Moreover, we are introduced to good and bad people from the humans and demons race and this juxtaposition shows us the cheesy reality that the real demon was inside of us all along. It is our action not our appearance that ultimately justifies who we really are as a person. Beside the philosophical tangent, the seiyuus of this show deserves a huge kudos for their work. Particularly, Natsuki Hanae, seiyuu of Tanjiro, really nailing the cries and the sobs. Clearly, having voiced Kaneki, it's no surprise Hanae has completely mastered the voice of suffering.

So far Kimetsu no Yaiba, from a character and story perspective, hasn't really done something too outstanding to set itself apart from other shounen anime but given that it is studio Ufotable, master of 3D backgrounds, digital compositing and computer assisted animation, adapting this anime, fans are in for a treat. Right from episode 1, all the way to episode 26, the anime looks more polished than my future. Every panel, every fight sequence, even every little gag skits, the level of detail that goes in shows what a studio blessed with ""unlimited budget"" and key animators can do to elevate an anime. This anime in short is just painting in motion. From the build up, to juxtaposiing emotions in every frame; it is just synesthesia. They use CG to mimic complex camera motions that are impossible to hand draw so when that is translated into samurai sword fighting, It's like watching an work of art. Moreover, it's not just animation, the sound team does a phenomenal job. From the OST, to the OP & ED song by LiSA, the amount of emotions it carries just makes you sit back and wonder, what have you done this year to be deserved of such movie level budgeted works in weekly anime episodes. Seriously, even the clashing & slashing of swords in the show are clean, satisfied and outright therapeutic. To sum it up, it's just shounen ASMR. You can never get enough of it. 
I am a perfect creature that is infinitely close to perfection.” – Muzan Kibutsuji
Overall, Kimetsu no Yaiba will undoubtedly be one of the great shounens to come out this year. I say that knowing what an amazing experience Mob Pyscho 100 S2 was and the almost failure OPM S2 turned out to be and the epic experience S4 BNHA will become. 2019 is the year of shounen anime and Kimetsu no Yaiba does a great job establishing a good foothold in the industry for years to come. The story despite being very average almost skyrocketed in sales after its adaptation thanks to Ufotable. This isn't to discredit a well crafted manga Koyoharu Gotouge created but just to put in perspective how much success is dependent on the studio that adapts it. Nevertheless, the show doesn't have a high replay value from beginning to end but certain fight sequences has an endless replay value. Definitely worth listening to the OST of this anime on repeat and knowing what a banger the show ends on, I'm hyped for S2 of Kimetsu no Yaiba. The best girl is Nezuko by far; SHE PROTECC SHE ATTACC BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, SHE DOESN'T SEE HUMANS AS A SNACC; and the best boy is Zenitsu (Sorry Inosuke fans); HE CRIES, HE ALMOST DIES BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, HE KILLS BAD GUYS! Regardless, viewers who love shounen anime or enjoys a dark fantasy set around the period of samurai, you should definitely give this show a watch.  Anyways, thank you for reading this review & feel free to share with me your favourite quote from the anime. Ciao.

                Best anime in its genre? Too hyped up for the quality it brings? Find out today's episode of ""I have no clue how to review this anime!""
So, Demon Slayer has confounded me. Here's the easy things to talk about: art, sound, humor, characters. The art is probably the nicest I've seen come out of ufotable. So, to say that about a studio that is known for their gorgeous art and animation, that's saying something. This time, ufotable didn't shove CGI down my throat, and I thought it came across a lot nicer than previous works of theirs. The soundtrack didn't wow me, though. At least,
                  it didn't catch my attention. 
The humor of this anime is something really unique. Most anime that have really good comedy have really good comedy because it creates its own tone within the anime. For example, when Naruto does comedy, it's like its own entity within the anime. Demon Slayer, though, didn't have that. It felt almost blended within the tone of the rest of the anime. Normally, the humor would get lost, but in Demon Slayer it doesn't. In fact, it kind of makes it more enjoyable. The characters are easy to talk about simply because they're easy to watch. I'm talking more about personality than character development here because it'd be easier for me to talk about that with the story, but the characters are written in a way that I didn't really need to think about why I liked their personalities--I just knew I did.
Which is kind of how I felt about the story. This is the complicated bit, though, because Demon Slayer simultaneously made me feel like I wasn't invested in the story enough to obsess over it but at the same time made me feel like the story was really good. The pacing really messed with me. The pacing in Demon Slayer, for all intents and purposes, should have made this anime suck. Fast pacing in a shounen like this, that benefits from slow training sessions and digging down deep into the characters, would normally mean death for the quality of the story. I still haven't been able to wrap my mind around why it works in Demon Slayer. Don't get me wrong--I can absolutely tell that the story would benefit from a pace similar to that of Boku no Hero Academia, but it also isn't being harmed by the pacing it has. In fact, the pacing works really well. It's not the only pacing that could work, and not even the best, but it works.
Now, the development of the story and the characters is probably why I rated this nine and not a ten. Yes, the pacing didn't make the story worse, but the lack of richness in world-building made it impossible for me to get excited about the character developments. For example, you have Bleach that shows Ichigo's development as a Shinigami throughout the run of the anime, right? But the reason Ichigo developing was interesting to watch, and the reason we knew that he had become one of the most powerful Shinigami, was because we knew two things: a.) the world built up in Bleach meant that the things that Ichigo could do either signified that he was close to the top in terms of power or that he achieved power that no one had ever achieved before and b.) the characters around him got built up with power levels that Ichigo constantly got compared to and which he constantly exceeded. 
Demon Slayer didn't do that for Tanjiro. His training happens in such a short span of time that the abilities he gains, while we know they are intellectually, don't feel special in any type of way. That hindered my impression of his abilities later on. If he is supposed to be special, and his sister is supposed to be special, how am I to feel that that is truly the case when I don't know what is normal or what is powerful already? So that put a bit of a damper on things, but again, I still enjoyed it a lot. Had the world-building been done slower, I may have obsessed and theorized about it like I did with Naruto or Bleach or Boku no Hero, but I enjoyed it almost as much even though it's not going to take up that much space in my brain.
I don't know if that is a credit to the writing or a detriment. It used its elements well, but it didn't use the best elements. The story has me interested enough to want to know what happens next, but not interested enough to agonize while waiting for the next installment. Does that mean it's a good shounen that made itself good without taking up 300+ episodes? Does that mean it's not as good as it should be? Does that mean it's bad for not taking the proper time to develop? I don't know. What I do know is that Demon Slayer is absolutely worth the watch. It may not have picked the best answer to the question, but it also doesn't feel like it's missing anything. It's perfect for what it is. I stand behind my score, so if you're curious about watching this, I recommend it completely.
And also I am pretty pumped for what's next.",9,BabyGirl06301

                {SOME SPOILERS MAY BE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW}
I found this anime, and got interested because of the title, and added it to my very long list of anime's I should watch. After some time, I had finally finished those anime's and Kimetsu No Yaiba was left. So I watched it, after the first episode, I was already obsessed. The storyline, the characters, the animation was all up to my standards! 
Tanjirou is the kind of protagonist we see in almost every single shounen anime, instead of being an annoying one, he sets the standards up to where we all love and adore him, he has
                  his sister Nezuko to help and fight alongside him, and unlike most other anime's he doesn't want to be the greatest demon slayer, nor had dreams of becoming one, but all he wants to do is become strong enough to protect Nezuko in hopes of finding a cure to turn her back in to a human. 
I also love the other characters like Zenitsu and Inosuke. Zenitsu may be whiny and annoying at times, but is the main comic reliefs and loveable at times, and surprises us all when we find out his true power.
Inosuke. I have to admit, I didn't really like him at the start because of how big of a jerk he was, but over the time, he had quite the character development. From being a self absorbed jerk to a sort of tsundere, especially when he finally realises the fact that he indeed is not stronger than Tanirou. Instead of having a breakdown and hating Tanjirou, he accepts it.
Overall, I love this anime and it is now one of my favourites. I highly recommend it, but I have to admit, the gore will be quite disturbing to some viewers, so watch out for that.",10,fushigore

                It's not my kind of genre I'm used to, but it's good. 
I love the art and it's kinda fun and chill to watch it. 
A story about a boy who lost his whole family except his sister as she has become a demon. 
Story - 9/10 - The story itself is exciting and funny. I love the combats (except the gore, but still it's fine). And the way the story is showing how he becomes a demon slayer. His progress, hard work and motivation. Also, the connection between him and his sister Nezuko is cute.
Art - 10/10 - I love the art really. The
                  clothes, eyes, colours... everything is beautiful. I can't say a bad word about the art. (Except some scenes or things are showed so weirdly, but I guess these animes have this kind of art sometimes in some scenes).
Sound - 8/10 - Nothing big, but it's more than enough, The intro and outro are nice and the BGMs during fights or usual scenes are not loud or interesting enough to listen to them, but they are good.
Character - 8/10 - I can't say much due to spoilers, but I love the main character with his sister, although there are a few other main characters that are destroying my brain cells.
Enjoyment - 8/10 - As I said, this anime is a chilly thing you can watch with some combats and interesting story. I wasn't totally overwhelmed by how good it was, but it was more than decent. 
Over - 9/10 - I have enjoyed this anime and I'm looking forward to seeing the film. I wouldn't watch it again as I think it would be boring, but the first anime of this genre that I'm watching and it's good.",9,SirValecekLuis

                Kimetsu was an anime that surprised everyone and everyone.
Well-fitted soundtrack, incredible graphic / effects work by Studio Ufotable and a protagonist that you get attached to very easily, Kimetsu almost manages to beat One Piece in sales in the Oricon Ranking with an amazing 10.8 million tests sold while One Piece sold 12.7 million units.
Talking about the now antagonist, Muzan (Michael Jackson) is really a villain in which you are afraid of the truth.
He is a type of villain who has none of his subordinates and just wants to complete his goal intelligently.
Bloody, cold and cruel Muzan is a 9/10 villain.
In conclusion, Kimetsu no Yaiba

                I'm completely disappointed with this anime, at the beginning, it looks like a decent shonen with a protagonist who accounts with good motivation, but as the episodes passed, many problems start to appear, first, the art direction has issues, yeah, yeah, the character design and the animation on the action scenes are great, but at the moment they tried to create some certain scenes, their building was lame, many parts of the anime hardly had any kind of appropriate anticipation (like the moment when we find the dead body of Tanjiro’s mother) and they only showed it... just like that, giving the ""factor shock"" sensation
                  that is always awful, and don't make me start with all the cliffhangers on this show.
The cast is mediocre, although some characters have a backstory, many others hardly show any personality trait, Nezuko is the cute little sister who just does cute things and sometimes, fights, Zenitsu is the bipolar coward who waits till the moment of a dire need to do anything useful, and Inosuke is a mad murderer who just wants to fight; the enemies showed a backstory, but this only appears till they died, resulting in wasted potential
The narrative suffers the problems of the average shonen, power-ups like the seal that allows seeing the arrows, or the moment when the protagonist results being capable to change the water style power to a fire style power, these things that came out of nowhere are the reason of why the anime plot-armors feels lame.
And that's it, a big disappointment to me.",4,Katecof
38000,"
                I started out really wanting to enjoy this show, but like many here, couldn't make it past episode 9-10ish before I just couldn't take it any more. The art is great, the fights more or less spectacular, but tragically, the characters and story are less exciting than the bowl of left-over white rice that's been in your fridge for the past 4 days. For me that's a no-go.
Truth is, there is just nothing at stake in this show. Nothing. For some people that's obviously fine given the popularity of this show, but if you care about depth and are not a big fan of the
                  morally black and white cookie-cutter story line where the good guy always wins, save yourself the time and watch something else. Again, all of this could have been palatable with some decent character development, but at least until episode 10, nothing of the sort was anywhere to be found.
For me, the specific trigger to stop watching was the proper introduction of the blond haired guy (I've banished his name from memory) and the accompanying migraine headaches of listening to his non-stop shouting. Someone needs to tell the writers that screaming and loudness does NOT equal funny.",3,pengionn
38000,"
                This show would greatly benefit by starting from episode 6. The first 5 episodes of our characters origin story are rushed and leave little curiosity left in the show. Rather than explaining everything so blatantly to the viewer outright, both the main character and his sister's circumstances could have been better teased out through a few episodes of demon hunting. Instead, the viewer is given a first episode that leaves nothing to the realm of imagination. If the viewer is at all familiar with Sonnen, he or she will be able to predict the events of the first 5 episodes. The characters are ordinary by
                  shonen standards, out the main character especially.
I see a lot of praise for this show, right now it is scored as an 8.5 on MAL. While everyone is entitled to their own tastes, I fail to see how kimetsu no yaiba comes close to the level of Dorroro (8.45), a show with a similar theme of slaying demons.
If you are new to the genre you may find Kimetsu no Yaiba enjoyable however I would rather recommend a more put together show.
6.5 out of 10 so far.",6,Shota--Kun

                Every now and then you get anime that just raises standards for everything. Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer) is most certainly one of those.
Story:
Story shines trough and trough. I find it remarkable, how well paced it was, while not feeling slow or fast, while still giving extreme details and well delivered story all around. Even last arc of season 1 (at time of writing, anime movie is announced, but it better have season 2), which lacked fights had plenty to keep viewers interested and wanting for more.
Characters:
Again, extremely detailed characters. What is remarkable is how demon slayer presents the fact that demons have supernatural abilities
                  and demon slayers only have comparable levels after extremely intensive training. All characters feel natural, even demons, with all having their own motives, fears, hopes- full blown characters and they all have depth. While main characters stick mainly with their personas, they still feel natural and not tropey- which is very hard to write.
Visuals and animation:
While everything else with this show is fantastic, then visuals are out of this world. Ufotable really outdid themselves with this absolute masterpiece. There is certain combat scene that just makes jaw drop so hard its hard to pick it back up- and thats on top of already fantastic combat scenes.
Sound:
What else can i say, but fantastic all around! From OP to ED to voice acting and in-episode music, you can tell everyone gave it their all!
Summary:
Well, what else can i say that this is new top anime. And its going to be very hard to beat! Definite must watch!",10,Meelis13

                (this is my first review here so bare with me)
Kimetsu no Yaiba isnt good. Its a cash grab for people who dont really watch anime and want to see pretty animation but nothing else. The premise is our MC, Tanjiro, experiences a terrible series of events caused by demons which result in his precious sister being turned into a demon. Now he is traveling the country with her in tow trying to figure out how to turn her back. Now this sounds interesting and sounds like a change of pace from the typical ""I want to be the best/strongest ever"" shonen anime, but is executed
                  poorly. VERY poorly. Without spoiling too much I will try to explain why this is the way it is. The characters have little to no development past the main character getting stronger. The episodes have about 7 minutes of actual content but then pad the rest with drawn out scenes of the characters hyping themselves up just to do one move. (Think of Goku going SSJ3 against Buu for the first time but longer and not as epic) The characters are all cut and dry copies of other characters in other shows even down to their backstories, which also dont explain how some of them are as strong as they are. On top of that its so predictable how things will turn out its almost a joke. You can honestly skip through 10 minutes of an episode and realize that nothing has changed in the episode, then they pull off the big finisher for a minute with no real change in the situation because they decided ""now im gonna do it!"" Theres no epiphany, no power up, no weakness exploit, they just do it because they decide theyre done being hit. The sisters situation is barely shown or explained after she becomes a demon. She develops powers that the other characters ""have never seen before"" then thats it. No explanation of why she is (or isnt) strong. One of the supporting characters has the most annoying situation behind him fighting that its almost insulting to watch. I would say what it is but that would probably be a spoiler. Just know that hes the nost annoying character and they change nothing about him. This show is rough. It relies on blood and pretty action scenes to keep you entertain while not giving you much of anything else. Which is disappointing because it world builds so beautifully. You see the potential of what these characters can do but they accomplish almost nothing. The fear and sense of danger they set up that ""no one is safe"" gets taken from you when the characters win just because theyre the main characters. The set up of a child being forced to grow up and quickly find the answer of how to save his sister gets taken away when youre 17 episodes in and realize they havent gotten the least bit closer to what they're looking for. All they get is information in one episode. The interesting (albeit annoying) side characters have no real motives to travelling with the main character. They meet up and then they just follow him just because. Im im not mistaken, he hasnt even told them what his goal is or where hes headed. I wish I could say there was some redeeming qualities about the show past the animation of fights for 3 minutes of 20, but there isnt. 
TL;DR: The show is mediocre because the characters are copy/pasted from other shows, and the story becomes predictable and develops at such a slow pace that nothing happens.",4,mrkruzjr

                An amazing season to the start of Kimetsu no Yaiba has come to an end..and I'm finding it hard to say goodbye honestly. From it's art design to the animation, you can't help but be mystified and blown away by its pristine presentation and I found it hard not to miss an episode as it released each week. 
The story follows main protagonist Tanjiro on his journey to becoming a demon slayer. As you might have guessed, the motivations of Tanjiro are..clearly going to be obvious but this also involves his sister Nezuko, who becomes the ""wait a minute"" surprise that intrigues this very moving
                  plot forward. 
What makes this tale such an engaging one is the gravity of this brother/sister relationship. It especially pulled me in on gravitational level as it relates to my personal relationship of having siblings and does an exceptional job of relaying this emotion as you watch this amazing anime unfold. 
It's hard to understate the fact that this anime does not seem to disappoint on any level. The soundtrack is just as on point as the rest of its offering and it all culminates in a must watch if this one slipped past your radar. 
Kimetsu no Yaiba has a bright future ahead of it and if an upcoming movie is not an indication that it is already on the level of motion picture masterpiece, then I honestly don't know what else to tell you.",10,thec0re3

                I absolutely love this anime because it gets me so fired up which only a few can
The story is quite interesting, you don't see it often and when you do see something like this it is often boring and cliche. I like the fast pacing in this anime, just 5 episodes and so much has happened, can't wait for more. 
The art style is just so cool and it seems fitting for the genre. Sometimes it's shocking while the other times it's so wholesome. The CGI on the other hand...
Can't say much about the soundtrack, to be honest, it's decent and I like the opening.
                  I think a theme which comes whenever he does something amazing or if something big is about to happen could be nice.
The characters are absolutely great.
MC is just a cool dude who wants to protect his family member(s), it is very admirable to see him push thru even tho the knockbacks are so big
The old geezer with the mask is very likable because he is so caring for his students, even if he doesn't show it much.
The sister is also very good written, while she struggles with her own problems when her brother needs some help she's always there
The absolute best thing about anime this is not a mindblowing story or visual effects, but it's the feeling, the hype you get when watching an episode. The awesome characters are all very likable and you will find yourself cheering for them.
This is why I gave it a 9

The story is absolutely interesting and makes me want more! I watched it within 2 days! I have never watched any anime like this before. It seemed pretty scary, but later on, the action was cool. I loved every demon's side of the story. I cried every time!
I never really cared for the art, but I loved their personality.

Boar head always seemed so aggressive for no reason, but he was a good friend towards the end, tho he beat up my crybaby Zenitsu. Zenitsu I swear is bipolar, but he is pretty cool. Tomioka seemed like a hero and I really like him. SABITO BROKE MY HEART! I truly loved his character when I first saw him and thought he was cool. 
I always got emotional and this series had the perfect balance of tears and action. There weren't too many funny scenes, but I still enjoyed it.

                Kimetsu no Yaiba already is THE Anime 2019 for me. 
It got an amazing story. It got overwhelmingly beautiful artwork. The music is just wonderful, it tears me up. The characters are all, well most of them, very likeable and I couldn't help but giving this the top spot in my favorite anime.
Kimetsu no Yaiba's story isn't completed yet. There's much more to come and look forward to. It pains me that I read the manga tbh because I'm not able to enjoy all what's to come with the beautiful animations blind. But I still enjoyed it.
Art and Sound are so amazing, creating such an
                  amazing atmosphere, it's unbelievable. The animations, especially in fights when they use their breaths, are the most beautiful drawings I've ever seen. I get eye- and eargasm everytime I see and hear the opening alone.
And on top of that the characters are all epic as hell. Ofc not all are unique and special and simply the best, but they are great nevertheless. There are some very unique ones tho and basically everyone has some kind of deep backstory. 
I have to say that I found some characters in the anime pretty annoying, I started reading the manga after ep 25 and got to love most of the chars I disliked in the anime, but have to mention that I disliked some by 'anime only'.
They also juggled between Action and Comedy pretty well and I would say the comedy is, even if not the best, really good. It's not comedy focused anyways but still gets you laughing everytime

                Out of the top 50 anime on MAL, 2 animes just defies all logic to me because I think they don't belong anywhere near there, one of those anime is Demon Slayer.
For the short justification for my rating: sleeper, only a few episodes are enjoyable and characters that are so uninteresting and unlikable.

One of the biggest points affecting my overall score is the story. Demon Slayer does not bring anything special to the table regarding the story, if anything the story starts with an extremely generic start and it continues extremely below average storytelling.

Demon slayer offers one of the worst set of characters. The main trio, being one of the most uninteresting trio, including Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke.

                This series was especially conflicting for me, it has probably the best animation we'll ever see, but on the other hand, the show is unbearable most of the times.
[Very Mild spoilers, considerably none]
I've had to drag myself every single time to finish an episode, and as much as I'd like myself to enjoy this show. It's just God awful in every other factor apart from animation. 
First, starting with the good elements:
The Animation, done by UFOTable, is beyond God-tier. Every frame of this show is wallpaper worthy. The bold art style and the CGI fits in perfectly with my taste and is done by the
                  most talented people in animation. The atmosphere and the music go wonderfully with the theme of the show. Before this, I'd consider with just those factors alone, that a series would be worth every minute. 
But, and here it comes, this show is hot flaming garbage. I am somebody that enjoys mindless Shonen, even the acclaimed shitty/mediocre ones. Naruto, Dragonball, etc. Even if they're cliched to death, at least they bring something interesting to the table character/plot-wise. This show, on the other hand, adds absolutely nothing. It makes things worse.
This show is a step down from a shitty shonen linear story formula. Which is very hard to do. Awful comedy, cringe-inducing characters, and the worst pacing I've ever witnessed. It was honestly the hardest thing to watch. It's sad, and all in all just plain stupid. The show is dumbed down to a point where there's nothing left. Watch any episode and you'll realize 90% of it is filler. In a 25 minute episode, almost all of it is spent on unnecessary monologues, life stories, and flashbacks. The fights, which I have to agree, are the pinnacle of Animation as of now, last at the most for 2 minutes. Even, in these 2 minutes the characters most of the time ruin it with offhand ""jokes"" and monologues. Just how much BS can you tact on a 26 episode series? It's painfully obvious the show is nothing more than it's animation.
The characters in this show are the definition of annoying and uninspired. Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke are the main characters. They're also the most annoying. Especially Zenitsu. His specialty is that he sleeps in the middle of his fights? sent off as a joke? Yes, a great idea. Even the side characters apart from a few are very linear and uninteresting. The demons hardly have any impact on the story. The character development is non-existent after the first 3 episodes. 
Honestly, If I were to go on, It'd take me a few days to finish this. I'd also spoil a lot, so I am going to leave it here. 
All in all, I feel like the community for the show has 2 sides. They either enjoy it or absolutely hate it for the writing. Like me. This show is very much overrated, but it's understandable why. I just wouldn't, in any state of mind give this show anything above 5/10. Would be an insult to every other show rated lower. 
If you're considering watching this. Don't. Just go watch the fight scenes on youtube and read the summary of the story. The same thing either way. For this, this show is gold-plated dogshit.

                Oh my god in heaven is this show a breath of fresh air!! It’s been a long while since an anime has evoked such a unique set of emotions from me. This is a one in a million series, so let me break down what’s so amazing about it as accurately as I can.
The characters. They are the heart and soul of Demon Slayer, and their complete lack of depth past simple caricatures is what will eventually bring you to tears. You truly feel for their sadness as well as their happiness, and you won’t be able to help rooting for them as this show
                  shamelessly condescends to you by using cheap tactics like psychological trauma and post-mortem backstories to manipulate the target demographic into wetting their diapers. When Tanjiro makes his fifth monologue about his determination to protect his sister in the middle of what’s supposed to be an intense action scene, you WILL feel his emotions, because the show might as well have put the words “FEEL THIS” on the screen like some kind of sitcom with a studio audience. And let’s not forget the villains, whose motives and personalities don’t even exist until the climax of their arc. This writing ability could only come from the most inspired of individuals. The nuance in character development truly makes me believe the author himself has an albino cannibalistic sister whom he carries around in a box to protect her from the sunlight and from people who don’t like albinos.
The story. This isn’t your typical shounen plot, no sir. In what other shows can you watch a young optimistic boy lose his loved ones to evildoers then embark on a journey to seek justice while gathering strength at a pace unheard of to his teachers and peers? In what other shows will you see an older brother go to great lengths within an organization to seek a cure for his younger sibling, who also fights along his side? No others, that’s for sure. The visceral gratification you get from self-inserting as the protagonist while he excels at everything and overcomes obstacles to defeat bad guys who commit violent murders is one of the greatest feelings ever, and Demon Slayer delivers. After the first twenty expositional segments, you’ll be completely immersed in the story and world of Kimetsu no Yaiba.
The production. While the animation is kind of meh (it switches to CG sometimes which is just ew!), the music conveys emotion almost as poignantly as the dialogue itself. The eerie feudal-era soundscape perfectly complements the orchestra as the strings and piano whisk you away to Feels Land whenever a character’s inner-monologue gets particularly epic. Even after finishing the show, the soundtrack sticks with you and chokes you up every time you hear it. That’s how powerful it is. I think I can credit the main theme for at least ten of the dozen times I cried while watching Demon Slayer. 
If I haven’t already expressed how much I love this show, I don’t know what else to do except watch it a hundred more times. Every smile, every tear, and every soft loli grunt is an adventure on its own. I can’t say much else about it without getting into spoilers about the amazing villain or about the greatest anime episode of all time (you know the one), so I’ll just stop here. Kimetsu no Yaiba is the one thing we’ve all been waiting for, and we’d be crazy not to bring it to the highest esteem. 
Absolute 10/10 overall, but actually 5/10 for making me feel like as infantile and stupid as shrunken Nezuko.",5,PicklePride

                A typical shounen anime, nothing more nothing less.
First the good parts about the show:
Amazing animation, maybe the best I’ve ever seen, the fights are very well executed.
Sound track is good but nothing amazing.
And that’s it basically.
The story starts very typically with a young protagonist whose family gets slaughtered by demons, and his sister turning into one. He now must slay all demons to avenge his family and heal his sister.
What drew me into the show initially was the dark tone the show seemed to have, darker than your average shounen that is, I mean his family was killed in episode 1, and literally all the
                  fights are at night, so you can imagine my shock when literally 1 episode later our protagonist Tanjiro was already cracking dumb jokes. Seriously if you start watching the show from episode 2 or 3 you’d never guess this was a boy whose entire family was killed, it was such a tonal whiplash. And to make things much worse, the humor is awkward, cringy and very misplaced.
The characters are definitely the biggest weakness, our main boy Tanjiro is such a good natured, determined boy to the point where it’s just boring and incredibly unrealistic. “My whole family was killed by demons? Well I’ll just train hard and do my best to become a demon slayer!! My sister is now a demon with no apparent cure in sight and could potentially eat humans? Well I’ll just have to defeat literally the strongest demons in the world to heal her and end a conflict that lasted centuries all on my own, while carrying my waifu-bait sister on my back, yeah that’s not impractical or stupid or endangering to her at all, I mean every time he runs into demons or demon slayers they both obviously try to kill her, but it’s ok because she’s both strong enough to face demons and composed enough to not eat humans, because yeah she was brainwashed by my new grandpa to protect humans instead of killing them, awesome! I don’t know kid, don’t you sometimes want to just cry underneath the crushing weight of the misery you’re living in? Don’t you at least want to consider cowering away from this terrifying fight and just live peacefully with your zombie sister before you eventually realize that you have to fight? Don't you remember any of your dead family members outside of when you want to get a sudden unexplained power up in a fight? Don’t you face any problems when you always have to kill the same demons that you’re so empathetic towards now that your sister is one of them? No psychological or emotional scars at all? No? You’re just perfect in every way? OK.

I know, it may seem very hard to love such a popular anime as this but it is truly great. Tanjiro's character shines above all the rest. He has the ability to sympathize and respect his opponents. For example, when he fights the bongo demon (Sorry, I forgot his name.) He makes an effort to not step on his writing and he would compliment his bongo playing whilst the demon is dying. Another of my favorites is with the spider family, while the demon is dying, he forgives him and knows he was misunderstood. Hell, he even hugs the former human.

                Honestly, I don't like horror and bloody genres. But with the exception of this anime, even though it's a bit disgusted, the story is really good. Moreover, the animation is really top, there's no match. I think again this is just season 1, it's already perfect like this, especially season 2 is even crazier for sure. It's true that anime doesn't choose the wrong studio, ufotable is the best. The music is also very perfect, it really fits the story well, the singing voice is also very good. From the initial episode, I really enjoyed watching, I honestly watched eps 1 at night, when I
                  found out the story was good, I stayed up late hehehe. Everyone has to watch the anime MANDATORY. awaited season 2 :)",10,darkos88

                This show was exactly what I needed. Please be aware that there are a couple vague spoilers in my review, nothing too fancy and nothing outside the released anime. No manga spoilers. 
The show, while seeming to be a pretty cookie cutter shounen, is anything but. KNY really handles grief and growth in a way that doesn't jarr the enthralling action and violence, but accompanies it, makes it interesting, long-lasting, and poignant. This is best showcased by Tanjiro. He loses his family and barely holds onto the threads of his sanity by becoming everything his family had wanted him to be--a good older brother. He
                  embodies this genuine kindness, this deep generosity, not only with Nezuko, but with each and every relationship he fosters. His gentle reprimands with Inosuke and Zenitsu, his appreciation for Giyuu, his consistent and unerring patience. The story becomes deeper, richer, when you consider that these may be coping mechanisms for a boy who truly has not had sufficient time to grieve the violent loss of his entire world. 
I enjoyed the richness of the relationships between the characters, and I think it is natural to be drawn into the sort of unconditional gentleness of a character like Tanjiro, but the show is also full of beautiful cultural elements, fantastic animation (I've never seen an anime like it--good job, Ufotable), and just a lovely mix of dark and light themes. The humor that is interspersed is welcome and is actually quite fitting. I might get hate for this, but the only character I found a little forced was maybe Zenitsu. I'm not totally sold on his character yet. 
I definitely look forward to seeing where this anime goes. Mugen Train, where the hell are you!!",9,katyajini

                As of this review, I've just started episode 15.
First of all, I'd like to get this out of the way first. This review is mostly just me venting so if I'm being a little unfair to this show, that's probably the reason why.
Also, Ufotable did a great job in the art department.  This anime is a feast for the eyes. Visually, I'd easily give this anime an 8 or above rating.
Here's what I do have a problem with: The direction of scenes and the characters.
So many things go into directing that it's very difficult to pin down what's exactly wrong with it but I'm
                  gonna' try anyway.
It feels like there are too many moments that pad out the run time. Tanjiro often just stands there in shock because he can't believe his eyes that an event is unfolding. Maybe I've just watched too many shows now but I just want it to get to the point.
I'll try to be as vague as possible with the story beats that annoyed me.
***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***
When Tanjiro encounters a very important demon in public, I don't understand why he just doesn't yell out that he's a demon. Tanjiro hesitates because the demon is posing as a human and has a family with humans. If there was room for doubt that this demon might be just trying to live a normal life I can see why he hesitates but he KNOWS he's evil. The demon even slashes at a man's neck during their encounter.
It feels very annoying when the main character is the one breaking the momentum of the moment when he let that demon get away.
*** END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS***
It's also the same when he encounters new friends into the party. It takes a really long time for him to explain that his sister is the demonic presence in his backpack.  Everybody is already aware that there's a demonic presence so why doesn't he just explain himself and that he's trying to find a cure?
Even her reveal to the other characters (which takes a full day later) feels like time padding. It has to go through this stupid gag where someone misunderstands that they're not in an intimate relationship. I've seen my fair share of anime and I feel like a have a good sense of what comedic timing is like and this anime just does not have it.
What might have been a funny moment outstays it's welcome with the characters screaming nonsense at each other.
Here is lies the second problem. The characters.
All 3 of the male protagonists who are traveling together are just variants of screams made into characters. 
There's the overly kind screaming one.
The cowardly screaming one.
And the wild screaming one.
It's like they're trying to make up for the fact that the only girl in the party can't/won't talk at all.
It ties in with the problem with directing. I get that overreacting is a form of comedy but if the characters overreact to everything, wouldn't that just become regular old reacting?
So in the end, who could I see enjoying this anime? I think that this anime is great for young and new anime fans.
For people who've been watching for a long time, unless visuals are all you care about in an anime, this show will wear down your patience as it goes on.",6,MikhaliX

TL;DR Review
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Show starts off quite strong, 10 solid episodes. Then falls flat when it take a sharp turn and introduces an incredibly poorly written character that subsequently ruins the entire tone the show has set up until then. 
Furthermore, after this point it becomes quite apparent that it's just another flashy shounen using the same generic formula of 2-3 episodes of being assigned and completing a task, followed by a rest episode and then rinse and repeat. 
All the while running into having awful power spiking issues at each new encounter due the purposefully obscured abilities of the characters used to force tiresome 'Deus Ex
                  Machina' plot devices.
Much wasted potential, and extremely overrated.
However, beautiful animation, and sound design as expected of a Ufotable production.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detailed Review
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kimetsu no Yaiba has an extremely strong opening half. 10 solid episodes that had my hopes high that I'd found another potential masterpiece of a story.
I was certain this anime was going to be a beautifully dark-themed mash-up of 'The Witcher' books/games but set in a historical era of Japan with a sort of wandering narrative like 'Mushi-Shi'.
The beautiful imagery of early Taishō era Japan, the Witcher-School like Demon Slayer Corps that takes on only the strongest Young boys turning them into monster killers, and the quickly introduced theme that not all Demons are monsters; Quickly sets the stage for an epic yet tragic tale.
I expected a story showing the difficult and grim path our MC Tenjiro must follow to to take revenge on the demon that butchered his family and turned his sister into a monster. It was certainly going down that route, until episode 11 when things suddenly took a sharp turn.
Well actually there are bits that did leave a bit of a foul taste in my mouth before this and immediately made it impossible to achieve >9. That being why does Tenjiro have this incredibly powerful sense of smell? Apparently we're expected to just accept this as the way things are. Also why does the Demon Slayer in episode 1 not simply ignore Tenjiro and fulfill his task of slaying her? This is illogical from his point of view.
That aside back to Episode 11!
Episode 11 introduces Zenitsu a frustratingly annoying character that uses a very poorly written version of the 'idiot savant' trope with a heaping spoonful of the 'overbearing flirt' trope. Think Brock from Pokemon. His scenes consist of him being frightened and screaming or acting like a fool and drooling over Demon-Sis. It's an extremely distasteful and poor attempt to forcefully inject humour, and honestly a completely unnecessary one as the show had a good balance of humorous moments prior to his introduction.
Many fans say his character improves with time, but from what I could find out it doesn't and it's usually those who read the manga first who say this, as in the manga he isn't able to be as obnoxious because he can only violate you so much in that form whereas in the anime he can violate your eyes and ears! Delightful.
This character is so abrasive and grating to watch he alone nearly turned me off from continuing.
And... I made it to episode 15. This is the point where I realized this is actually just another mediocre but flashy shounen.
My bet is the show is going to continue giving these demon slaying tasks that'll take 2-3 episodes each, and the group is going to move around and complete these with an occasional rest episode in between. The season will end with some sort of cliffhanger regarding vital information to his goal and will pick up next season to continue the pattern. Whether that turns out to be true or not isn't really of consequence because that isn't my main issue.
The formula is nothing unique, new, or exciting. 
However, besides it being an overused formula. 
The main problem I have is these ""newbie"" Demon Slayers seem to crush every demon they come across with relative ease, using self-produced 'Deus Ex Machina' plot devices related to their 'special techniques' that are much closer to just straight up magic than it is to actual human abilities; Which I wouldn't have a problem with if they were explained adequately and they had actual limitations.
Then as soon as you believe there is a limitation to their powers they simply take two separate techniques and combine them to make an even more powerful move! or better yet just give themselves an internal monologue pep talk up until they they can beat their foe!
Which is incredibly disappointing, because I didn't think it would end up like that seeing as at the beginning of the anime Tanjiro showed his excellent mind for strategy and battle analysis when facing Giyu; using his wits to attempt to defeat him knowing he stood no chance in actual combat.
If instead of just doing a 2 year training montage and instantly powering up the MC to master level swordsman in all but rank (which already pushed the limits of my suspension of disbelief). If they had him learn the basics for 2 years but only learn the special techniques over his journey gathering information; such as giving him some sort of ability to absorb the demons blood techniques and use them himself to a lesser effect. Say his black Nichirin blade for instance could have this power. It'd provide for a more gradual curve in which he gained strength and it'd be a lot more interesting to watch, especially if battles were made to rely on formulating plausible tactics to defeat the enemy rather than just bursting them down with whatever technique fits the scenario. Also limiting secondary characters techniques to 1 or 2 at most while being much less powerful and more tactically useful rather than again just more burst options.
This would solve both the issue of the inexplicable power spiking at each new foe encounter despite being the lowest ranked demon slayers, and would ground the series closer to reality because his powers and limitations would be known by the viewer and when he used a technique to defeat something it would feel less like a 'Deus Ex Machina' element and more like just the MC simply fighting tactically with his available tools.
As for Zenitsu, either ditch his poorly written 'idiot savant' trope or the whole character. He is irredeemable in his current state, his personality isn't amusing or relatable. If instead they gave him a character arc that focused on his lack of self-confidence and overcoming it; It'd make sense, and be relatable. And his constant shouting and hyper exaggerated fear isn't amusing either it just detracts from the feel of what should be tense scenes.
I'm so frustrated writing this review, because this anime had such great potential to be a truly incredible story but it fell flat after setting up an otherwise quite interesting world.",4,KnightSirius

                Kimetsu no Yaiba started off on the right foot. This anime establishes a nice trajectory for the main characters and story with beautiful artwork and pacing. Right from the first 5 minutes you know what is going to happen - no spoiler - but I am fine with that because the execution works. The pacing is decent and sets up the next part of the story.
The first 6 episodes are done well and everything within this world makes sense so far. It moves at a pace that keeps us turning the page (and in this case watching the episodes). But halfway through episode 6 during
                  the arrow fight, it seems the writer left or something happened where everything takes a turn for the worse. The world and characters suddenly change as well as the genre. You will know mid-episode when a recap happens in the middle of a fight and then the tactics are gone, comedic parts are thrown in to be entertaining and new characters that dilute everything the story had going so far. The pacing also dies off and it felt like 5 episodes could be turned into 1 interesting one or cut altogether.
If you are watching this anime, stop at episode 6 where things are still good and wait for the remake. The story line has potential but is wasted after episode 6.
Overall, the artwork is very nice, story is predictable but still executed decently and enjoyably.
If I were to give a comparison, it starts out serious like Fullmetal Alchemist and then happens to get stuck in Candyland where they get distracted and join forces with Meowth and Wobbafett. I mean they're very different of course but just giving you the heads up.
Before 6, the story is a 7, art is an 8, sound is a 7, character 7, enjoyment 8, overall, 8

                Speechless! I definitely love this anime! This is my TOP2 anime for 2019 and will go very close to anime of the year. I love all my sword fighting anime. Tanjiro is one MC your fall in love with as the story unfolds capturing you right into it. Love the animation, art, enjoyment, and overall is breathtaking. 
Lots of fun characters especially the Hashiras who are similar to the anime 'Bleach' known as the squad captains. A few of them are bullies lol. Lots of strong villains.
I can not wait for Season 2 to be released. 2020 here we are.

                Battle shounen, a genre designed to attract a large audience with the least amount of effort, it doesn't require any research or studying, only basic knowledge of what people would like, and this pretty much sums up what Kimetsu no Yaiba is all about, since it's one of the most basic shounen anime I've ever seen.
-The story: it's nothing new, a young boy named Tanjirou has his family massacred by a demon and then trains to become a demon slayer.
The story could've been interesting but it suffers from laziness, the writer tries to avoid any complicated conflicts that would require effort to solve.
For example, the
                  most interesting part about the story was how Tanjirou had to protect and tame his sister Nezuko who turned into a demon...
[Spoiler]
She gets brainwashed early on by Tanjirou's mentor to be friendly with humans (if he could do that, then why not brainwash more demons?), and she turns out to be strong enough to protect herself and others and even fight other demons (even though she doesn't eat humans, which was established to be the way demons get stronger).
[/Spoiler]
The writing is also too lazy, the characters narrate their own stories, nothing is shown in an interesting way, the writer spoon-feeds you everything.
Even simple moments such as Tanjirou talking to a girl in early episodes, he literally narrates their conversation instead of showing it to us.
-The characters: nothing about them stands out, Tanjirou is a copy/paste from Midoriya Izuku (My Hero Academia), he's too nice and perfect.
Nezuko is not a proper character since she acts like an animal, she nods and listens to Tanjirou's instructions which means she understands human language, but she can't speak for some reason (she used to speak normally as a human, and all demons so far can speak except for her, so it doesn't make sense, but I guess the writer thinks it's cute).
Urokodaki, Tanjirou's mentor, a strict oldman that becomes a father figure for Tanjirou, he's an interesting character but we don't know much about him.
Zenitsu, it's early to judge him, but so far he's one of the most annoying comic relief characters ever.
-The world building: the lack of it is confusing, at first it gives you the impression that demons' existance is not commonly known among people, but later on you notice that they are everywhere.
Maybe it's early to tell if there's going to be anything interesting about the world, but so far it's too basic, it's Japan in the 20th century (not sure which decade) and it has demons, that's basically it.
-The action: this is the best part about the show, I give credit to studio ufotable, it's known for having high quality animations, also the writer came up with creative superpowers that made some cool fights.
The only problem is that due to the fast pacing most fights have no build up and end very quickly which makes them forgettable, the only exception was a fight in the early episodes when Tanjirou was trying to learn how to use his superpower.
-The pacing: it feels like modern shounen anime are trying to avoid the slow pacing that Naruto and One Piece are infamous for, but the problem is that they end up too fast paced that you have no time to care about anything.
Tanjirou met a demon slayer and then started training to become one, right after the death of his family, he didn't have time to grieve which took away the shock and sadness of his loss.
And there are many other examples of this problem but I guess you get the point.
Overall this show is worth watching if you want to see cool action (at least it doesn't try to be more than that) but don't expect much from it.",6,DiabloMask

                I was very happy to see that the one-star option used the word ""appalling"" as the adjective. I was concerned that the star rating would not be able to portray my deep, deep hatred for this show, but I see these fears were unfounded. This show has very good animation. I wish it was attached not to this ass-fucked, god-shitted, show.
The fightscenes are very boring. If you look past the nice animation, they're all very simple beyond their gimmicks. The fight with the drum guy was interesting, but they just sat in that room as it rotated around. The fight with the ball woman: they
                  just jump around in the backyard while the woman throws balls at them. It looks pretty, but it's like a moldy peach. You bite into it and it's fucking disgusting. (Also I hate peaches as a fruit in general). The fight with Akaza is just them punching and hitting each other on the side of the train tracks. The train guy was gross he turned into this nasty train worm and it was just nasty. And then he died instantly. Because tanjiro is amazing and strong and we love him so so much because he is the protagonist and is very very powerful. I guess I'm getting into another problem. Tanjiro reminds me of wheat thins. He is SUCH a nice person guys. HE IS SO KIND. It's boring. He's just like every other protagonist. He is perfect in every way. Then he starts crying about his sock puppet family (sock puppets because they have no personality; more on this in the next paragraph). Then he is instantly fine. They need to make up their mind, happy and then crying. I get whiplash.
The characters are very one-dimensional. Tanjiro's family gets killed off so fast I am not sure why we are supposed to care. When they tried to do that sad flashback in the movie I laughed. Was I supposed to feel sad? Sad that these pictures died and now this other picture is sad? No. Because these characters are so one dimensional they are just pictures. Of course then we go to the boring boring training montage where tanjiro runs through the forest over and over again and then whatever he goes off and does some shit I don't remember. Zenitsu would be interesting if his ""sad"" past of not being good at anything was not a complete joke to everyone. The little sister girl. ... what's her name ... oh right nezuko. She does not speak. She spends most of her time in a box. Buy a stuffed animal of her and you can feel like she is there in the flesh because she has the personality. of a inanimate object. Let's see. Who else is there. There's the pig guy I don't remember his name he's angry or something and that's it. It's funny I guess but there is no substance. Ok who's next. The chicken man. The flames on his coat look like the flames I used to draw on paper airplanes in first grade so they would look cool. He never blinks and is too cheerful I dislike it I was happy when he finally died. Especially since he was alive for one movie. Was I supposed to care? That they introduced this one-note character and then killed him? It was cheap. Let's see, the bug woman. I like her. She's funny. Moving on. The other characters don't really matter. Who else is there? I don't remember.
The animation is very good. But that makes me hate this show more. There is no plot, they just have a bunch of separate events strung together, reminds me of spongebob. I know that's a narrative strategy, but since there's little worldbuilding around the larger society beyond the demon slayers, the sporadic plot makes it feel like an empty story. Everything is shit. I fucking hate it. (Except, of course, the animation, the music, and the bug woman). I made this account just so I could shit on it. I struggled to write this review. It was immensely difficult. I can barely remember the show. It was barely memorable. It astounds me that this show is popular. It fucking astounds me.",1,Johnathaj

                This is the type of show that I'll keep telling my friends to watch over and over again until they watch it. I don't care if they don't like anime or any cartoons. All I say to them is ""Watch it or regret it."" 
Story: (10/10)
13 years old Tanjirou, is a kindhearted boy who lives with his family(Mother and 5 Siblings(Nezuko, Rokuta, Shigeru, Hanako, and Takeo) they make a living by selling charcoal to the Local Villages down the mountain. But one day while Tanjirou off trying sell the charcoals. Something terrible happened. On the way back Tanjirou witnessed something, possibly the worst thing could
                  ever happen to someone. He witnessed his mother and his 4 siblings(Rokuta, Shigeru, Hanako and Takeo) has been slaughtered. And only one survived, Nezuko. But she got turned into a demon in the process. Tanjirou joined the Demon Slayer Corps to avenge his family. And also find the way to cure his sister back to normal. The story goes from there.
I just love how the story went. The fact that he's still strong after losing a family in the blink of an eye, at the age of 13, Is just mind-blowing. The hardship of being the oldest sibling. And trying his best for his little sister. And he also trying to be a strong brother that doesn't have any weaknesses, to the point he tries to hide the fact that his ribs are broken. Tanjirou is someone you want to be if this stuff happened to you.
The comedy in this anime is also something I like. I know it's mainly friends arguing and screaming at each other faces. But I enjoyed. I can relate to it. Me and my friend hop in the discord call and just arguing and screaming at each other. Especially about anime. It's just my type of humour.

As for the characters. You already can tell that Tanjirou amazing by the things I said above. 
As for Nezuko:
Nezuko being a cute demon she is, trying her best not to do the demon things (Killing/Eating human.) At first she still confused on whats going on and attack his own brother. But as the story goes, even though there's rarely any word coming out of her mouth. Her character development is pretty decent. With the help of Urokodaki-san, Nezuko be able to maintain herself without consuming human flesh or do bad stuff to humans. ""Human is family and Demon are evil"" Even though that's what Urokodaki told her, she still doesn't attack a good demon. Which in my book is FANTASTIC! And the fact that Zenitsu and Inosuke bring a different side of Tanjirou. You can tell they slowly becoming a good pals. The characters development for these trio is pretty cool. I don't want to spoiled more about these two, so just watch it for more details.
Art: (9/10)
The art is something new to me. The way the Water Breathing is drawn, it is definitely something I can appreciate.
The way the water just twirling on Tanjirou's blade is just. WOW. Safe to say water breathing never fail to amazed me. 
I can't talk much about the background, mainly because I don't paid close attention to it. Since I didn't complain about it and didn't notice anything bad. IT'S A PASS FOR ME.
Music: (10/10)
The Opening, Ending and The OST is fire! With LiSa singing both Ending and Opening there's nothing for me to say but to put them on my playlist. As for the OST ""To Destroy the Evil"" something I frequently listened to. AND THE ALL MIGHTY ""Kamado Tanjirou no Uta"" THIS SONG IS SO GOOD!!! Even though there's no Full version for it yet. I'm still jamming to it everytime. Give it a listen if you have nothing better to do.
Enjoyment:(10/10)
Throughout the whole show, I'm either Smiling or Laughing and sometime I cried. If show can make me do these things, it's either I liked the show or loved it. And after watching 21 episodes of it. I can confirmed: I'm in love with this show. The Story, Art, OP/ED, Background Music, Characters and The Animation is just something I'm fond with. This show is REMARKABLE. You won't regret watching it. Especially when you hit episode 19. 
I GUARANTEED IT.
I highly recommended this show to anyone.

It’s easy to be let down when your expectations are lofty. Unfortunately, disappointment is more than just a decent or lackluster product coming about after one anticipates a masterpiece. It’s perhaps even more frustrating when you set them accordingly and humble them, simply expecting the work in question to be a decent or entertaining action spectacle and time passer with some heart to it. It’s not quite the same as the phrase “I expected nothing and I’m still disappointed”, but it’s similarly annoying and deflating, since a work fails to even live up to the idea of being tolerable.
Kimetsu no Yaiba
                  tries desperately to be the show pictured above, and there are glimpses of that potential. Unfortunately, the show is bogged down by a complex, interwoven series of issues that make the show downright insufferable. The worst part is that it’s not like the story itself is even that bad. Sure, there are certainly strange worldbuilding decisions and some aggravating ass-pulls, but the issue is more a matter of presentation, of the storytelling, as well as some of the characterization.
Before we tackle the complex web of issues that bog down the show, let’s examine the positives and what the show was trying to go for. Director Haruo Sotozaki and his team at ufotable did a pretty good job with the visuals. Sure, the 3D backgrounds can vary wildly in quality from relatively acceptable to Holy God Jesus Christ help help help, but outside of that and moments where said assets are pretty clearly reused, there isn’t a ton to complain about regarding the visuals. It does happen a bit too often and the colors can be a bit much, but barring those and the spinning CGI room fight in the middle of the show, the visuals are pretty vivid and stylish in a way that works. The action animation tends to be fairly fluid and both the various demon powers and sword breathing techniques are stunning. They’re all vibrant and unique, while not even needing the studio’s trademark lighting effects to make them shine. Everyone gushes over the explosive final sequence in episode 19 but even most of the other fights have gorgeous, bombastic attacks that are a treat for the eyes. It’s not exactly the studio’s best work or anything, but it’s another solid-looking show by one of the most reputable studios in anime nowadays.
The music is also a highlight, as Yuki Kajiura has decided to go with an eerie chanting approach instead of the bombastic choirs most of her work is littered with. It’s an interesting change of pace, even if not always the most pleasant, though the more standard orchestral tracks aren’t anything to write home about. This isn’t one of her best OSTs --not by a long shot-- but it is an interesting change of pace. The OP, “Gurenge” by LiSA, is a solid rockin banger that’s harder than what we normally hear from this artist. The ED, “from the edge” by FictionJunction feat. LiSA is more of a haunting yet still determined piece that’s befitting of the show’s sound and atmosphere. There’s also the special episode 19 ED, “Kamado Tanjirou no Uta” by Go Shiina ft. Nami Nakagawa. It’s a beautiful and explosive chanting and singing piece befitting of the most bombastic moment in the show. 
With all that being said, it’s time to discuss what the point of the story was. On paper, it’s simple, what many would call standard shounen fare. Tanjirou’s family was killed by demons with his now demon sister being the only member he has left. He sets out on a quest to restore her while becoming a more proficient demon hunter, climbing up the ranks as he encounters various demons with varying ties to the ultimate demon they must defeat: Muzan. 
What’s supposed to really elevate this idea outside of the cast of characters he meets along the way is the emotional storytelling that’s at the forefront. Tanjirou’s sister still accompanies him and protects him despite now being a demon, so he protects her as the only family he’s got left. He’s better able to show compassion to demons cuz he’s seen firsthand that they were once human, only now corrupted by an evil curse that leaves them craving human flesh and blood. He inevitably has to kill them, but not without learning about who they once were as most of them air out any final regrets or personal backstories from when they were a human or early on in their new lives as demons. In theory, this pathos-driven storytelling should make this series emotionally resonant. Have the demons’ pasts and motivations be carefully sprinkled out before the final burst of feels while having their current selves have even the slightest ounce of humanity and decency, and suddenly it becomes easy to feel for them as they’re finally put down. Sure, you’re never to root for them, but since Tanjirou’s an empathetic protagonist, we’re meant to empathize alongside him, feel the tragedy of how these people were turned demonic as they are finally put to rest on the journey to end this curse once and for all.
Unfortunately, this show doesn’t exactly like the idea of subtlety, knowing when to place backstory information, or respecting one’s emotional intelligence. Instead, every time a mustache-twirling puppy kicker motherfucker is on the verge of death, we spend several minutes on their sad anime backstory before they finally get beheaded and destroyed. 
There are a few critical problems with this approach that makes the experience far more maddening than resonant. Pacing and characterization are forsaken for big sad plot twist backstories that do have some obvious signposting on account of the demons alluding to them, but nothing’s built up through clever environmental storytelling or having any surrounding folk familiar with any given demon allude to anything for the audience to piece together. We simply interrupt the fight or death scene to dump a sad anime flashback that can range anywhere from 2 minutes to over an episode long! Most of the time, these boss fights involve just pure evil monsters! While that can work fine for grunts we never learn about, it’s hard to care when for 90% of their screen time, most of these beasts are almost entirely one-dimensional baddies. It’s emotional manipulation at its most glaring, while being a tremendous pace-breaker.
The first time this happens is in the opening moments of episode 5, where a dedmon known for eating Tanjirou’s new master’s former pupils explains that he was sealed off in the land we’re currently fighting him in. Fucking really? We paused the fight for this and are suddenly supposed to give a shit? Tanjirou’s meant to empathise with this?! How about in episodes 12 and 13 where the bongo demon was a disgraced former 12 Kazuki member (i.e a disgraced member of the big bad organization of the series) in a couple of very intrusive flashbacks, only for Tanjirou to not fuck up his scattered writings so we can learn he was a disgraced writer, too? Isn’t this a little excessive and ridiculous? 
Then there’s the spider family arc from episodes 15-21, where two backstories end up hurting the worst. There’s the spider mom who was a victim of abuse by the rest of her forcefully made-up family. She mentions this once or twice after the “son” threatens to have the “father” beat her up again. Therefore, when Tanjirou faces her and is ready to strike, she welcomes her demise with open arms, reaching for death so she can finally be free from abu-oh here’s the flashback where we see her getting beaten up despite us already knowing this and not needing it shown to us. Oh dear. The scene isn’t outright ruined by this, and it’s one of the two times this show managed to be effective in making a demon’s fate seem resonant and tragic. Still, this is more than a little intrusive. 
Can’t be worse than the “son”, Rui! Skipping over episode 19’s epic scene since that has some core issues of its own that will be addressed soon, the bulk of 20 and 21 is spent on this cunt’s backstory. See, he used to be a frail boy who was enamored by a story of familial sacrifice as a father risked his life for his kid. Unable to capture that semblance of overwhelming love from his own family who sheltered him, he felt empty. Then, he was infected and became a demon, so his father tried to kill him. He killed the parents in retaliation, only for the mother to apologize for not birthing him with a healthy body in her dying words. Horrified by the realization that he killed his loving family and that his father was probably planning a murder suicide, he was able to be emotionally manipulated by Muzan and he infected other demons so he can “recreate” the family he never thought he had until it was too late. This is why he’s a foil to Tanjirou and his genuine familial bond with his sister. This is why he took an interest in the girl to the point of trying to force her into the “family” while trying to kill Tanjirou.
Did we really need several flashbacks over the course of 2 episodes to explain this...as he’s dying?! Fuck having pieces of his backstory carefully fed to the audience before a quick final reveal is had as he airs out his last regrets and thoughts. Let’s pad out the runtime and drag out every attempt at whoring out them tears for as long as humanly possible!
The middle portion as a whole is the perfect encapsulation of everything wrong with the series! We’re not even done here as the intrusive flashbacks that often pad out and emotionally manipulate instead of earning those tears, aren’t solely applicable to the demons! Tanjirou, and a certain yellow turd we’ll get to have them as well! Let’s go back to the fan favorite moment in episode 19. Tanjirou’s on the ropes against Rui before we flash back to a moment with his long-since gone father dancing with fire. Understanding this and using his water-breathing training, Tanjirou is somehow able to perform a PHOENIX BREATHING ATTACK that requires perfectly concentrated breathing. This comes outta nowhere with no semblance of foreshadowing or anything beforehand. In the same scene, his sister, Nezuko, has been bleeding out thanks to Rui entrapping her with sharp strings. Seeing that Tanjirou’s struggling in his final efforts to finish off Rui, she somehow manages to unlock a demon art involving blood, and uses that to aid Tanjirou and disarm the wires so he can land the killing blow. Well, that is until episode 20 revealed that despite Tanjirou’s epic decapitation fireworks display, Rui...somehow decapitated himself to survive, and he can just put himself back together.
Let’s disregard how when demons are decapitated, they’re supposed to just fuckin die after a bit as that’s the surefire method to kill them until this contradiction comes up. Let’s ignore how this utterly cheapens the already stupid ending to the previous episode by retroactively robbing Tanjirou and the audience of that (less than) earned victory so a Hashira named Giyuu can land the killing blow instead. This is yet another example of the show just pulling flashbacks outta thin air to justify something because Kimetsu no Yaiba isn’t interested in doing anything organically. It doesn’t care about anything being earned! As long as the tears are dragged out of those eye sockets of yours, let thou be BLUDGEONED and your precious scenes be interrupted! Akame ga Kill deserves a fucking apology at this rate, and that show’s even worse than this one!
Episode 17 is a particularly intolerable episode for this as well, but it goes about things in a different manner. Here’s Zenitsu. He’s the absolute fucking worst. He’s a coward, a pervert, a whining, screaming little pissant who never shuts the fuck up and gets in the way always until he’s knocked out so that the badass within can perform an epic thunder-breating style technique to save the day. We saw this once in episode 12, he mastered the technique and looked cool doing it. Apparently that wasn;t enough as the show has to drag out the 17th episode with flashback after flashback after flashback after flashback explaining that he has self-loathing due to his personal and combat failures cuz he’s a fuck-up, so he has to master this one technique and it’s supposed to be epic and moving when he does the technique we already saw him do 5 episodes ago but with extra movements and whatnot. 
Fuck off!
Unfortunately, we still have the characters to deal with. We can ignore how weird it is that no one in Tanjirou’s family aside from maybe his dad even knew about demons despite them being a widespread issue. We can ignore how demon slayers aren’t officially sanctioned by the government despite citizens across several towns and villages dealing with demon problems on a widespread scale. We don’t need to focus on worldbuilding when the botched pathos and generally awful cast are more important issues!
Tanjirou himself isn’t a particularly bad protagonist. He’s pretty empathetic and sometimes that gets used pretty tastefully like when one of the demons dies a horrific death due to uttering Muzan’s name and his curse making her body turn against itself, so all he can do is hand her the temari ball she used as she’s fading away. It’s not particularly hard to root for him as he isn’t whiny or obnoxious, either. He’s just sorta safe and there isn’t much to him outside of being empathetic and driven to save and care for his sister. There are times, especially towards the end, where he becomes close to being a gary stu since he's never in the wrong, he moralizes like crazy and always wins that way, and can just shove off injuries like broken ribs like it’s nothing in the heat of battle. He also never shuts up when monologuing about anything in the heat of battle. Sure, sometimes it’s good to hear him internalize demon attacks and make strategies on the fly. It’s what any of us would do when facing a boss in a video game, except it becomes rather excessive here. The show loves being excessive about everything, don’t you know? That’s why most of the comedy is loud and obnoxious and the flashbacks and monologues are the way they are. 
Nezuko is...an object and a plot-device more so than she is an actual character. Sure, she gets taught to treat all humans like family and there are a couple of funny and adorable scenes with her. Still, she gets shoved in a box for most of the show while being the object of admiration and affection by many. Obviously she can’t fight in the sun now that she’s a demon, but even at night, she only comes out when it’s convenient after episode 6 and oftentimes, is in an elongated slumber before only waking up when the next arc is about to start or when we need another emotionally manipulative victory lap like in episode 5. Great female deuteragonist treatment, guys!
Then we have Zenitsu. Fuck Zenitsu. He’s genuinely insufferable for reasons mentioned above. There’s almost nothing redeemable about this cowardly pervert who spends most of his time lusting after women and screaming at the top of his lungs over everything! Sure, there are a couple of moments when he shows actual decency and even tries to help Tanjirou and Nezuko, but most of the time, we’re left with an insufferable cunt whose screams and cries are close to early Black Clover levels of grating. Even his self-loathing which came out of nowhere in episode 17, isn’t even brought up again, almost like it was never meant to factor into his character at all and instead was only used to trick the audience into feeling things while the runtime got padded for like 10 minutes.
The final member of the main tetrad is Inosuke and he’s the only fun one. He’s basically a somewhat sadistic meathead who loves fighting and has only one brain cell. He’s stupid, earnest, constantly getting Tanjirou’s name wrong, and is the only one capable of allowing for some actual character chemistry that isn’t just idiots screaming and whining about everything. His stubborn pride and sense of violence are exploited in hilarious ways as well, like his refusal to accept that he’s injured several times before passing out. Pig mask man over here is just bonkers and he actively elevates the show almost every time he's onscreen. There are weird gimmicks they incorporate with him every now and then but otherwise, he’s an genuinely fun character who provides most of the comedy that actually lands in the show. 
The only other characters that are worth mentioning are Shinobu and Muzan. Shinobu’s one of the few Hashira, i.e the highest-ranked demon slayers. She and Giyuu are some of the only remotely tolerable ones considering the rest are boring or aggravating upon their episode 22 introductions. She has this delicate air to her that’s contrasted by her maliciousness towards demons, making for a simultaneously cute and disturbing character who’s fun to watch. Plus, her heart to heart with Tanjirou as she encourages him to keep up his breathing training is nice. It also elevates Tanjirou’s character a tad when he senses unbridled anger within her that she generally keeps buried deep down after her dying sister expressed that she wanted to always see Shinobu’s smile. It adds more layers to her character than what anyone else has so far, and it’s regrettable that the show can’t have more down-to-earth moments where the characters can just breathe, talk, and engage in anything personal. 
As for Muzan, he’s just a motherfucker who is so extra that he kills people in every single scene he’s in. He’s in control like when Tanjirou tries to strike him down in public only to see the man’s wife and kid before the dude takes advantage of Tanjirou’s stunned horror and confusion to turn a random passerby into a demon while the family isn’t looking. There’s not much else to him so far, but every scene he’s in becomes fun and amusing with how brutal this man is. Every time he shows up in-person, his body count increases. There are other characters who are sadly rather obnoxious like the dude in episodes 8-11 who constantly simps for his demon doctor lady, but said lady herself is one of the few remotely interesting and likable characters here. It’s a shame most of the cast leans towards the boring and obnoxious side, and that they and many others are constantly bogged down by these intrusive flashbacks that are often meant to define them.
So, yeah, the show’s incessant usage of flashbacks that constantly drag out episodes and interrupt fight scenes to justify stupid bullshit for the sake of epic reddit twitter moments and MUH FEELS is actively insulting. There’s way too many of these, making an otherwise fast-paced experience slow down to a crawl! It completely cheapens the story and any semblance of pathos since almost nothing ever feels earned and so much time is wasted to meet that 26 episode quota. While a lot of shounen such as One Piece and Naruto are notorious for their adaptations having slow moment to moment pacing, the fact that KnY manages to do this with a short episode count after the first 9 episodes starts becoming even more grating since it’s not like the show was drawn-out from the start. It really feels like they were stretching and padding to reach episode and runtime quotas. Even the cast and humor suffer from this on top of both often being obnoxious. It’s a shame since there are a couple of fun and engaging characters, but we have to put up with Zenitsu, and all the flashbacks and whatnot. The fights can be somewhat entertaining every once in a while, and there are some moments that truly are resonant. However, apart from these, the music being solid, and there being a couple of downright gut-busting moments with Inosuke, this show is a wash.
Kimetsu no Yaiba has no chill or respect since it has all the time in the world to force feelings rather than earn them. It’s hard to understate how this approach to storytelling and presentation utterly kills the show. The writing outside of that isn’t even particularly broken. There aren’t a ton of plotholes or asinine moments and mechanics that don’t make sense. Outside of a few asspulls, it’s not like the story on its own is terrible. It’s all just bogged down by the myriad of intertwined bullshit bogging the show down. This review may seem a bit too harsh, all things considered. However, it is that way because the show presents these moments of beauty and potential, only to squander the bulk of all that while being loud and obnoxious. That’s why the first 4 episodes are the best part, as the show only really became unbearable after episode 5 hit. The last 4 episodes are also relatively bearable outside of a few sticking points, but that’s like ⅓ of the series that isn’t constantly annoying or maddening. Thankfully the movie would come along and show what this series is truly capable of, but that’s a story for another time.",4,CodeBlazeFate

                - The story is average like your generall action/monster hunting anime with a theme about family bonding and etc. Nothing outstanding.
- The art style is fine. Except for episode 19's Epic fight scene.
-The sound is again fine. 
-Characters. In my opinion, the main characters are boring. None of them stand out to me. Tanjiro is just another average protagonist that wants to protect everyone, and get his sister to turn back into a human. Inosuke is a hot-headed person that tries to be cool and all but can be genuine to people around him. Zenitsu is one of those annoying protagonists that happens to be
                  super powerful. (Again, very mediocre). Finally, Nezuko is the main protagonist sister that happens to be very cute to grab the viewer's attention whenever she is on screen. AND She is a badass.  
-My enjoyment before episode 19 was fine. I didn't like it or hate it. When Episode 19 came out, I thought I was starting to like the show. The episode had incredible music, art, fight scene and message behind it. However, after episode 19, the anime sucked (for me at least). From episode 20 to 26, all we got is a bunch of pillars and the main characters' training/recovering from episode 19 fights. It was so cheap. None of the pillars got significant screen time from those episodes. The anime even spent a whole episode on Tanjiro and Pillars talking/fighting (barely fighting) in front of Pillars's mansion! What a waste of money.
- My point is that this anime does not deserve the praise its been getting. If you like this anime, good for you. If you hate it or don't like it and you think this anime is overhyped, I agree with you.",6,LordSozin

so at first I wanna say I love this anime so much because I connect a lot of emotions with this anime, my expectations were 7/10 but now... my fav. anime. I cried some times. I love these emotions in animes, and in demon slayer it was the best I ever saw 
and this anime changed me so hard as a person escially the film was very good

the story a 9/10 because its not soo special but still very good

                Shounen is a tried and true genre that has grown through generations of stories building off the predecessors that inspired them. For the most part, audiences and creators alike know what works and what doesn't by now. There are story beats, character archetypes, good-guy power-ups and bad-guy boasts that we've come to expect - and it would be a mistake to think otherwise. Though these tropes are not inherently bad - they are merely another way for us to scratch our unending desire to endlessly categorize and file familiar things in media. It does not matter if the same trope is used a thousand times
                  in a thousand different stories - what matters is that they have a purpose, and if that purpose resonates with both the characters and the audience.
Demon Slayer is not a story that takes a lot of risks. For a seasoned anime fan, Demon Slayer doesn't waste any time checking off every shounen trope in the book. Yet at every familiar turn, there's a light ahead that keeps you captive to the journey: A lingering mystery, a cliffhanger, the prelude to a thrilling battle. After coming down from those highs there are times your patience might wear thin, but then it pulls you back in again. This process can be frustrating, but despite the ups and downs that come with shounen series, the elements that Demon Slayer excels in make it easy to forgive its shortcomings. For someone new to anime, Demon Slayer would be a fortunate first entry into the world of shounen anime, with an easily digestable episode count. For anime veterans, you'll see echoes of characters and arcs from series past that you've loved and hated, willing and reluctant at the same time to take those familiar journeys again.
STORY (6/10)
+ Straightforward story with clear goals
+ Solid setting & timepieces
+ Compelling story arcs and worldbuilding with potential for larger stakes
~ Power system is very simplistic, lacks logical structure
- Tonally jarring and overbearing humor, jokes don't always land, some drag on too long
- Foreshadowing could be utilized better
The story of Demon Slayer is laid out simply. Our main character Tanjirou's family is slaughtered by demons - save for his sister Nezuko, who has been transformed into a demon, who thirst for the blood of humans. He vows to avenge his family and to restore Nezuko's humanity. And so his journey begins by training to become part of the Demon Slayer Corps, to find the demon responsible for slaying his family, and for discovering how to save his sister.
I would say the story of Demon Slayer is where the anime has its most glaring strengths and weaknesses. It's only speculation, but I believe Demon Slayer must be an ambitious learning experience for its creator, mangaka Koyoharu Gotouge, as this is their first published manga that has run for more than a single chapter. And when you look at it that way, it's easier to understand why Demon Slayer sometimes clumsily handles shounen pitfalls, while later handling the same scenarios better.
Ufotable's adaptation thus far has been absent of wasteful filler with brisk pacing, so this first season is packed generously with content. Because of this, I could talk about the story forever - but to keep it short I'll share my thoughts on some things it does well, and others it doesn't.
As far as strengths goes - Demon Slayer's world is full of compelling mysteries and conflict. It is the early 20th century in the Taisho period of Japan - while the advent of an industrialized Japan is on the horizon, the rural settings and traditional Japanese aesthetic is still dominant. And so the presence of demons plaguing their world blends perfectly with the almost mythical status of those who fight them, and the techniques and weapons they use. The story shines its brightest when the fights between humans and demons transcend beyond characters loudly announcing their next attack or technique - something that is largely trivial to the story - and instead give the audience a conflict deeper than blood and swords. While many demons that Tanjirou and his friends face end up being ""monster of the week"" fodder, we'll see a side of them that gives them humanity, and begins to blur the black and white line the story presents at the beginning. By the end of the first season, you really begin to question what larger meanings are stirring in the world of humans and demons, or even if they could possibly coexist. The best shounen are known for making you question what you believe to know as good and evil, and Demon Slayer begins to tap in to that, which I hope it will continue to build on in its coming seasons - and judging by the spectacular sales of the manga and the anime I have no doubt will come. Demon Slayer raises the stakes with each passing arc, and it's easy to see how a 2nd season could build on what the first establishes, as the true powers that be have not shown their hands yet.
While Demon Slayer is a fairly serious story, there are plenty of moments of humor, and it felt more miss than hit here. There is a lot of yelling and screaming used to deliver comedy (more on that later), with plenty of 'reaction faces' and chibi moments to boot. If I had to describe these moments in one word, it would be hyper. We're talking sugar-high, kids running around with permanent marker and no parental supervision hyper. It can clash with the tone of the episode sometimes, especially during battle scenes. Whether you enjoy this kind of humor depends on you, but how quickly you tire of it will probably depend on your age. Personally, I never laughed at any of these scenes, and many of them physically hurt me to watch as some drag on for far too long. But then there are moments when you're caught by surprise, and a snide offhand comment or quick visual gag will be thrown in, and make you laugh when you weren't expecting it. It was relieving to laugh out loud at Demon Slayer when it wanted you to, and I think the comedic timing by the animators at Ufotable helped a lot in delivering these moments. Humor can really help tie together a story with a lot of violence, tragedy and death, because you can't bum out your audience forever. The author certainly knows this, but are going overboard at times.
Yes, Demon Slayer is not without its moments of weakness - and while the story is ripe with potential and fascinating questions for the audience to ponder, it sometimes immediately smothers those opportunities. Easily the best example I can give is that at one point, a demon mentions his craving for a special kind of blood that only certain humans have. Immediately your mind starts to flood with possibilities - who has this cursed blood? Why do they have it? Why do demons want it? Well, worry not - because quite literally right after this blood is mentioned, Tanjirou's familiar appears out of absolutely nowhere to explain away everything about it, instantly dissolving the tension and creating a pointless distraction for an awkwardly placed bit of trivia. These are rookie story mistakes that hearken back to early days of shounen where authors couldn't hold back anything longer than 5 seconds, or assumed audiences wouldn't remember something being foreshadowed for longer than 5 seconds. It can do a story a lot of good to withhold information from the characters and the audience until a time when it needs to be known.
And whether this is a negative or neutral point to you, it's important to mention this: Demon Slayer does not present its audience a power system or set of rules for how powers really work beyond what a character needs to do to make them work - which usually involves some kind of special breathing. As far as you should be concerned, the techniques and powers characters can utilize are more or less elemental magic. If you're looking for Hunter X Hunter levels of structure within shounen battling here, you will not find it. If that bothers you, you may have a very hard time watching Demon Slayer. As to whether the story will address these things later on in serious depth (as Hunter X Hunter did not introduce its power system rules by this point in the series either) I cannot comment. I am judging this series as a 26-episode anime, and what is contained within it.
Overall, Demon Slayer is solid in concept while clumsy, but formidable in execution. While it rushes out the gate and stumbles a bit, I feel the author earnestly learning how to tell a better story along the way, and it's rewarded by sticking the landing after a couple worrying stumbles on the way there. Hopefully in future entries, the weak elements of Demon Slayer's writing will be ironed out. There's more good here than bad, but there's plenty of room for improvement. While Demon Slayer has lots of potential, it will be tough to live up to it, but it's hard not to cheer on the author when you're riding the high of a fantastic arc with a satisfying payoff only to realize the first season is winding down for an ending.
CHARACTERS (7/10)
+ Bond between main characters is strong
+ Demon Slayer corps supporting cast are eccentric and compelling, leave you wanting more
+ Cast helps the story blur the line between good and evil
~ MC can feel too powerful at times
~ Demons can feel like ""monster of the week"" throwaway characters
- Zenitsu's personality is overbearing to the point of being obnoxious
There are a lot of characters in Demon Slayer, too many to go over here. Because of that, I will keep it to a few groups of people, and my thoughts on each.
TANJIROU & NEZUKO - a very strong sibling relationship, but not creepy or sexualized in any way. Tanjirou is honorable to a fault, as one would expect of a young, capable shounen hero. He is also incredibly powerful, sometimes to the point where he may as well be impervious to injury. Despite this, he does have his limits, and is not always victorious in battle. In fact, he fails a lot, though he often surprises his enemies or sparring partners with his natural talent. Overpowered? Probably, but within reason - as ridiculous as that sounds.
Nezuko is adorable, but sometimes felt more like a pet companion rather than a real character. It doesn't help that she can't really speak, but at times it's obnoxiously cute. Speaking of obnoxious...
ZENITSU & INOSUKE - Tanjirou's eventual travelling companions. Inosuke is a stubborn, short-tempered fighter overflowing with pride. Zenitsu is, well.. mostly a whiny, blubbering coward who is almost constantly screaming.
Zenitsu has his moments. Brief moments. Moments of pause, introspection and gorgeous fight scenes. And maybe this is one of those characters that is better seen through the scope of a manga, because then you wouldn't be able to *hear* him. I began to dread episodes with Zenitsu in the preview because of how obnoxious he is. If you're supposed to like this character and root for him, it's a hard sell. While he does get a sympathetic angle and a bit of backstory to explain why he is the way that he is, he's also a bit of a degenerate pervert that is played off for cheap laughs, and you always have that in the back of your mind. Overall, I don't have a very positive impression of Zenitsu. He's fairly selfish and genuinely unlikeable. If he ""gets better"" as the saying goes, it didn't happen much here. Again, he does have maybe 5 collective minutes worth of screentime where you can come to an understanding with his repulsive personality, but he's so overly exaggerated that you just want to see him grow up as fast as possible - and we know that's not happening.
Inosuke is also very loud, but in a more tolerable way. He is the type that refuses to run from a fight, and must always prove himself. He clashes with Tanjirou's personality to make for a great rival, and when he has vulnerable moments you can really feel how hard it is for him to express his feelings as someone who spent most of his life disconnected from society. As far as the travelling shounen trio goes, his chemistry is far more compatible than Zenitsu. You just know they are going to become great friends and want to see that relationship develop.
THE DEMON CORPS - There are so many characters within the demon corps that you will meet. They are all an eccentric bunch, but the one that struck a chord with audiences the most was almost certainly a hunter named Shinobu. Soft-spoken and elegant, yet terrifyingly powerful and overflowing with conviction, Shinobu meets Tanjirou and his company about halfway through the series. As far as I am concerned, she is a supporting cast member that has such a great story you wish she was a main character - and a character that leaves you wanting more is always a good thing. For the most part, many of the demon corps characters you will meet don't get as much attention as she does, but it is implied that they'll have much more screen time in the future. If any of them are half as captivating as Shinobu, good things are in store for Demon Slayer fans.
THE DEMONS - Again, a large cast, but mostly throwaways. Demons are introduced and then promptly killed in their respective episodes or mini-arcs for the most part until the second half of the series. Some get little backstories, but they are fleeting epilogues when someone you just met is about to die. But they are there to serve part of a larger narrative - that demons are often a product of their tragic past. The more it happens, the more you start to feel that there may be some grand misunderstanding of demonkind, that their circumstances in another life were taken advantage of by a greater evil. And in fact it is part of the implication based on the limited information the series gives us about the story's overarching villain, who leaves the limelight as mysteriously as he appears. Again, most demons come and go, but as part of a bigger story and concept of the Demon Slayer universe, there is a lot of potential and it's beginning to bare fruit already.
ART (10/10)
+ Excellent animation
+ Consistent quality
+ Solid direction that matches the source material
+ Elevates its source material
This may actually be the best thing about Demon Slayer. And I don't mean that in a negative way, but the staff at Ufotable did such an insanely good job elevating the source material for animation that its significance is hard to overstate. From front to back, Demon Slayer is consistently well animated, masterfully directed and is visually coherent and compelling. I would recommend reading the Sakugabooru blog ""DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA – THE POWER OF UFOTABLE’S HARMONY"" (ep 19 spoilers) if you'd like to know more about the inner workings of Ufotable and the massive amount of industry experience and skill that came together to make Demon Slayer happen. Almost all of the fights in Demon Slayer are breathtaking spectacles that raise the stakes through the sheer power of what magic only 2D animation can bring. Demon Slayer is full of cuts that demonstrate what truly makes anime special and a worldwide phenomenon. What's happening on the screen is sometimes more spectacular than what is actually taking place in the story, but what matters is that not only can you feel the passion of those working on the series and that they truly care about making it the best they can be, but that Ufotable gives their staff a schedule that allows them to create a series like this and give it the attention they felt it deserved.
I could nitpick some 3D/2D hybrid scenes and moments of awkward pacing, but when it comes to TV animation, to ask for more than what was delivered here is silly. Demon Slayer is an anime series any studio would be more than proud to have in their portfolio, and meets a standard of excellence rarely seen in a world of overworked and underpaid animators.
SOUND (9/10)
+ Music is tonally appropriate
+ Sound design elevates the scenes
The music of Demon Slayer is very appropriate for the time period and helps immerse you into the world. There's a few standout themes, but as far as earbugs go Demon Slayer is mostly inoffensive, for better or worse. The sound design and effects also bring more energy to fights and the atmosphere. Overall though, there is nothing here that detracts from the production of the series. The music always plays to the tone of the scene, and the sound is always on point.
ENJOYMENT (6/10)
+ Made with intent to be as good as they could make it
~ Mixed feelings in the first half
~ Many memorable ""good"" and ""bad"" moments, but good outweighs the bad
~ May be harder to watch for long-time anime fans used to shounen
My mind races trying to piece together all my thoughts about Demon Slayer, and subsequently breaks trying to condense it into a ""yes"" or ""no"" to the question ""did you enjoy Demon Slayer?"" There were times I was excitedly speechless, times I wanted to turn it off in annoyance, and everything in-between. However, The times where I had negative reactions began to wane as the series went on, and I found myself - to my own disbelief - anxiously waiting for the next episode more and more. And now? I think I ""get it"" - I get what Ufotable staff see in Demon Slayer, and why they put every ounce of effort into making the anime as fantastic as they could have. I get why the fans of the manga assure me that my qualms with this and that will be resolved. I get that the mangaka is learning how to write a story with this many layers and this many characters, and I see that growth throughout the series. As cynical and jaded as I can be, and as much as I may have even subconciously wanted to say that I didn't enjoy Demon Slayer... I can't say I didn't.
OVERALL (6/10)
All that being said, I have to give Demon Slayer a final score with a nice round number. I'm not going to lie, it took me a long time to come around to Demon Slayer, but at the end of the day, I kept watching it - and I'm glad that I did. But I still have to keep all my feelings in mind about it through the weeks. There were times I wanted to drop it, times I didn't believe I was going to like it, but rather reluctantly sit through it. I'm relieved to say that in the end, despite my gripes, that I want to see more and eagerly await a second season. My entire thought process on Demon Slayer is usually ""well, bad thing, but also good thing"", and I like the good things more than i dislike the bad things. At the risk of continuing to repeat myself, i'll just give a few other scores to sum up my review.
FIRST HALF: 5/10
SECOND HALF: 8/10
ZENITSU: 3/10 - this is a failing grade, see me after class

                If you want a Shounen Anime that makes sense, this is not for you. If all you care about is Good Fight Scenes then sure. For the most part its pretty average. Very Strong Main Character on some sort of quest making friends along the way to go stop some bad guy. Even from Episode 1 you can tell that it does not, and will not make sense. Its almost like the person who is writing this show keeps forgetting what he/she wrote and is just trying very hard to get to the fight scenes. I have NO IDEA how this show has an 8.9
                  rating considering how many AWFUL Plot Holes it has that makes the show make no sense. But then again, All you need is good Fight Scenes to make the Bandwagon Masses of people think a show is good. The Art Style though is very unique and pretty. It's not something you seen often at all.",3,iLoveWater

                A typical but watchable shonen mostly carried by some great animation and music. Nothing particularly new or creative about this world, this story, these characters. Most of the characters are under-established, quite generic and aren't really that interesting beyond their design, Backstories whenever featured feel sluggish and forgettable. I wasn't able to connect with a lot of the emotion in this anime, mainly because of how blunt it can be in it's execution, with extremely theatrical and unnatural dialogue. The humorous scenes are also a hit or miss but it did have it's moments and offered some good laughs along the way. One thing I
                  really liked though were the villains, not as characters but I felt most of them had very interesting and especially creative powers, which worked very well with some great animation and choreography for it's action sequences. Despite all its flaws however, it still does manage to be just about entertaining enough for me to allot twenty minutes of my time every week for it, and wouldn't mind it getting renewed for another season, in fact I think it has potential, even if it unlikely will, to break it's generic shell. Also a shout out to the OP and ED, great songs complimented by great visuals.

                *THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*
If you’re a newbie that have started to watch this anime recently just because many people said that it’s good, has amazing art and great fight animation scene then I suggest you not to read this review any further. Kimetsu no Yaiba has a great support studio animator like Ufotable (that becomes popular for it Fate series and great art animation) but still failed to connect the viewer with it story and the characters. Why? I’ll explain it below.
Before I discuss the main problem of the series, I want to praise their music and sound first. I don’t see a problem at
                  all with their voice actors.  Their voice suits well the characters. They put such a good song with LiSA (that often collaborate to Ufotable for their project) in it and the background sound that I find fresh and unique to help building up scene by scene in the series. Other than that, of course the art section has the best recognition from all of the aspects. Because I know a lot of people including me interested to watch this because of one aspect that truly have impact for a lot of anime viewer, and it’s the art. But a series that has great art and animation without a well structured story behind it will never be a good series. It is just like to enjoy a view on highlands but cannot found any mountain there.
Kimetsu no Yaiba actually has a very decent story like any other anime that tells the main character’s main conflict and then start the adventure right away. At least, they did well for the opening episode to describe it, but slowly after that, it becomes weird, especially since the training session. Like there’s so many hole that needs to explain but they just cut it right away to mainly fills the story with its action more than the main conflict that main character’s has.
First, the story aspect. Before they begin telling the story to audience, they need to describe what kind of world that the main characters lived in. Of course that included the main problem of the story, the demon. How they existed in the first place, how usually many people in the village being ate by demons and so on. Despite of it, the audience still didn’t get that answer till the end. The synopsis of the series said that the main character wants to avenge the death of his family. So, the revenge feeling of the main character is the reason that started his journey to kill Oni (demon). But aside from Tanjirou’s goal to regain his Oni sister, Nezuko to become human again, I don’t feel this “deep revenge” at all through out this series. Even worse than that, I don’t see anything related to that revenge and hatred feeling from Tanjirou who has his family have been slaughtered by some demonized thing that consumed Nezuko to kill the rest of his family member. He only seems angry at the beginning but none of scene that shows the process for that anger becomes revenge after that. Did he just try to be positive after that kind of thing happened to him? Did he hate Oni because of that? Or did he try to understand other Oni because his sister has turn into Oni too? There’s not enough explanation. Then after that, the answer to that many question is just one, in order to make his sister becomes human again, he has to ask other Oni to find the solution. And I think that’s one of the most silly reason to make Tanjirou forget his revenge. The main self problem of the main character, gone, just like that. 
After that, I already said the story becomes weird since the training session, right? That happened because Tanjirou’s training with his masked teacher felt so short and didn’t tell us about what kind of power that he could develop in the future in detail. Yes, training part for some reason could be boring to watch but this problem could leads to plot hole and device for next several episodes. So it needs to be explained cannonly.  For this series, it felt like I was seeing a physical practice for long (not described how much long in one episode), but nothing more than that. And suddenly he can do mainly anything, like his jutsu, some kind of water dragon style or don’t forget to mention his ability to differentiate human and Oni’s smell too (even more, he knows whether they are a man or woman. Hmm isn’t a bit suspicious? Just kidding). I don’t see any problem if he have a power like that but again at least the writer must add more explanation related to Tanjirou’s power according to that, like how far he could use both that jutsu and smelling ability. Not just remove the detail of training session and power system (which is the biggest important factor that mainly every shounen genre have) and make a lot of flashback scene anytime the writer wants to strengthen the main character.
Next, the unneeded cringey jokes. I actually surprised by the comedy that has many part in each scene, for example like how unrealisticly Tanjirou’s thrown away to the sky and miraculously gone like stars which reminds me of Team Rocket. Because at first, I thought it will gonna be a dark concept series about “revenge” along with a lot of supernatural elements, but I guess I was wrong. However adding a comedy in the wrong time could disturbed not only the pacing and the viewer’s feeling but as well the story serving. It’s like every time when the story becomes serious, the writer added a joke in it that in my opinion doesn’t need to put there in the first place, because some times it works but mainly not. And it’s even funnier when I realized that there’s no comedy in this series’s genre.
Then the last problem of the story section is none other than “deus ex machina”.  I’m sorry to say this but I could not maintain myself to laugh out loud and confused at the same time when I watched one of spider demon episode which suddenly appear an unknown randomly character from Demon Killing Corps that wants to killed the demon because he wants to get a job promotion. When he appeared, I instantly thought like, “Who are you? I don’t even know you. Should I care?” That kind of scene added just like that when Tanjirou fighting Rui. It had succeeds to crushed the serious moment of the scene. Is the writer wants to make that scene more intense? If so, then I guess he or she absolutely failed. Other than that, the solution that the writer prepared for filling the plot hole feels like forced just to keep up the main story that already told before. Without further explanation and conflicts that the story have, they just added scenes that invite the audiences more question because lack of details in the beginning. For example like in episode 19, how surpsrisingly Tanjirou’s power leveled up suddenly just because he remembers one time back when his father still alive (the breathing technic).  Even more bizzare, miraculously the same thing happened to Nezuko when she suddenly had that blood technic power to kill the demon. I mean other than Urokodaki’s training, I didn’t see the power progress of that sibling’s power at all. I don’t even know that Nezuko could had a power like that. There’s always a reason behind everything and that problems ahead included. It needs more developing part to support that scene so the audience could see how they could upgrade their power to the next level.
Second, the character’s section. The characters in this series somehow felt inconsistent. This is because the writer’s decision that put more comedy effect in the progress than focus on the main story, just like Tanjirou’s “revenge” feeling which mysteriously gone throughout the whole episodes. After that, there’s annoying character who I see as a “moment destroyer” in this show. Although I must admit in the middle of the series’s episode, his past story is well presented. Then there’s some characters that popped up suddenly to resolve the problems that main character’s have (related to deus ex machina part). And there’s even some character that don’t need to be shown at all. Just be honest, the talking crow is really weird. Next, the existence of Demon Killing Corps character’s is unclear. Why it could be formed from the beginning, what is their purpose and mission haven’t been explained. All the audience know that they are a corps that have a job to killing demons. On the villain side, Muzan Jackson (I call him that because of his appearance resembles of Michael Jackson) have not well described after his first encounter with Tanjirou (who godly could differentiate his smell among a lot of people in the street). Rui, the white skinned demon just confused me with his intention to make Nezuko his own sister as replacement. I mean I know that she is cute but his reason to act like that feels so sudden and quite unnatural. Not to mention, Tanjirou’s father and the rest of his family member that have died who had a small role but affect the big impact of development to Tanjirou and Nezuko’s power both physically and mentally in JUST ONE EPISODE (it’s not even whole episode, just several minutes). I think it is reckless the writer to do so, the scene became felt too rushed. Again, I agree the fighting scene is remarkable but I sense a big hole in there.
Last but not least is the enjoyment section. To be honest, I enjoyed Kimetsu no Yaiba enough from the first episode. I thought the story could expand more better. But eventually, I got a lot of disappointment since the training session. However, I can still hold to watch the series till the end, so I guess it’s not that bad.
In my opinion, Kimetsu no Yaiba with its amazing art animation has a potential to become a good shounen story, but still not the best shounen anime. What Kimetsu no Yaiba has to fix are mainly three part, their consistency of their story, the character’s intention description and as well as the importance of detail and explanation through out the scenes. I don’t know whether the anime well presented from the manga though, cause I didn’t read it. Despite of that, this show is perfect for all of you who enjoyed shounen with more fightings than the story tells. It has unique historical vibe and support the supernatural genre with its demon and character’s design.  It attracts the audience too with fierce but beautiful animation as the adventure of the two siblings begin through the end of the series",6,Tomoyami_Reiki

                I was off of anime for a while due to dealing with personal issues, so i didn't have a lot of time to watch and missed a lot of shows during my 5 year hiatus, but if i had to say what anime brought me back and recharge my love for anime again it would be, Demon Slayer. This anime is one of the best i've seen in a long time, story, art, characters and world building pull you into this world and never lets go.
Tanjiro and Nezuko are a breath of fresh air, they are truly brother and sister, and without the weird sibling
                  relationship going on. Inosuke and Zenitsu are hilarious, and other characters (who will probably be more flesh out next season) look interesting. I can't wait for Mugen Train and Season 2!",9,MelanatedKnight

                I stumbled upon this anime through a YouTuber's review of One Punch Man season 2. I'm not joking, and what an amazing find.
The YouTuber reviewing One Punch Man s2 was lamenting the drop in the show's animation quality because the genius animation team in charge of OPM season 1 had shifted over to work on Kimetsu no Yaiba. Curious by what sort of anime would tempt the godly animation team to go over I picked up KNY.
First off, true to the genius of this team of animators, the animation in KNY is GODLY. Truthfully, there is no anime released in 2019 that has art and
                  animation that's at KNY's level, that's how good it is. The background, the use of lighting, colours, the amalgamation of traditionally drawn art and CGI is flawless. It's ufotable, it's the team that made OPM 1, so yes, it's sublime. Can't find better words to describe it, just go watch it.
Next, the soundtrack. It's pretty good from the get-go, you can feel your emotional heartstrings being tugged exactly where the creators wanted them. But when you reach certain key episodes (yes, including the critically acclaimed ep 19), the pristine use of soundtrack to enhance the emotional intensity, the viewer's experience, would bring tears to your eyes. Literally.
The story isn't some mind-blowing novelty but it delivers. It focuses on familial bonds and the main character's kindness. It's shounen but with a softer, emotional touch. Maybe it's due to the author being a female. In any case, I really liked the story. The presentation of the family theme was done just right, it's not cringey, it's not cheesy, it's quite convincing so I found it an immersive experience.
Finally, I must say the ability of this show to amalgamate all the different elements, animation, lighting, soundtrack, fight scenes, emotional scenes, comedic effect, is really something admirable. Usually, a show can do well on a couple of things or even all the different elements but fail to amalgamate all these wonderful things into a cohesive viewing experience. But Kimetsu no Yaiba managed to synergise all its strong elements such that they become better than their individual parts.
I'm so glad I found this anime.",10,ShanAsuna

                To be honest, I don't understand what this show is going for.
It was a well executed show at first. Then when the main character recieves his weapon, everything changes. The seriousness built up around the main character, the atmospheric vibe, is all destroyed by some of these ""comedic"" moments. As someone who enjoys Black Clover, with Asta screaming at the top of his lungs in nearly every episode, as someone whose favourite character in MHA is Bakugou, and as someone who loves One Punch Man's Speed-o'-sound Sonic, these shows just absolutely NAIL that type of character. These shows are more light hearted in nature, which
                  makes them fit in.
The sword forger guy is just silly, and his ""jokes"" and the reactions to them are out of place. No attempt to give the humour any meaning or context, or make the humour fit appropriately within the calm setting the anime has set up to this point. But it gets worse. When we later on meet a doctor, her companion is also annoying. But it gets worse. When we once again encounter Zenitsu and Inosuke the show takes a turn in the worst way possible.
I understand that we are meant to feel sympathy for the demons but it's done in a poorly executed manner. They build them up as ruthless, kill them off, and then while they're dying they have a ten minute long flashback about how their traumatic childhood forced them to want to eat people in exchange for being strong. Not only does that not make sense, it actively undermines the satisfaction of killing off the villain.
Now, villains don't have to be black and white, like Hisoka from Hunter x Hunter. He is crafted as a likeable character as well as a fierce villain. They are given a personality. Zenitsus gimmick would be interesting for a demon, but for him to have it and do the same thing in every episode gets old. After the first 2 times he does it.
As for the pacing, it's really really inconsistent. In the beginning of the show it appeared though it would have a fast but steady pacing. Nope. Some fights span 5 seconds, other span 2 episodes. Sometimes we spend half an episode watching a dead demons back story, which completely removes the tension. If you wanted that backstory, introduce it when you introduce the villain not after he dies. When the ""bad guy"" is dead I don't want to watch his entire traumatic childhood. If these stories were told before they die, maybe I would actually feel something for them WHEN they die. That being said Tanjiros reactions to their deaths are always bittersweet and well executed.
Pacing when it comes to the ""funny"" bits is also wierd. 5 minutes of Zenitsu saying the same thing over and over again is NOT funny. I mean, if new things happened, if the characters said different things each time in new ways, or if there was a dialogue between them I wouldn't mind. But it's just Zenitsu monologuing the same couple of lines for 5 minutes. I skipped it every single time. Inosuke had this problem in the beginning as well but got better as the show progressed. I hoped it would do this for every character but it refuses to.
Something else it refuses for its characters are words. Yes. Often, characters do not respond when spoken to. And sometimes characters don't listen to what's being said. And it made me hate almost every demon slayer. This is how Inosuke was introduced. Hot tempered, refuses to listen, even though he talks, while Zenitsu in the same scene, refuses to talk. Tanjiro refuses to talk as well. Tanjiro later refuses to talk to the Hashira. Like, I'm sorry, but building up story moments and refusing to build an understanding between MAIN CHARACTERS but then doing it for VILLAINS is infuriating. Basically the only character you like is Tanjiro, because he's the least stupid and not evil.
...with all that being said there are certainly qualities in this anime, though it is not related to the characters or the pacing. The story is mostly good. The fights are beautiful and exhilirating. It's what I enjoyed about it, and I endured the other aspects to hopefully find new, more redeemable qualities, and it got slightly better after reaching rock bottom.
The Art is mostly beautiful... however, why do no female characters have pupils? Why don't the demons have them? How do they see? Half the characters have lifeless eyes and it doesn't help to make them feel more alive. There is an overuse of the 3D models as well. They look worse and very distinct from the drawn characters and its breaking the immersion to needlessly switch back and forth in scenes when they just .... STAND STILL! One thing to do it in fights to allow better camera movements, but when they are standing still talking.
I will watch the next season, but I want it to be better than this one. I want it to be good and I believe it can be better. A lot of talent and effort was put into this.
EDIT: Because I think I may have been unfair to the series in a variety of ways, I vow to rewatch this sooner or later. When I do, this review will get updated.",5,Collaide

                As many other people say, this show is very shounen-based. I give it a 10 on all the categories to rate this anime.
One of the disappointments of the show for me was that the cliffhangers sometimes ended at a point which a sensitive person would feel quite anxious and worried in. Instead of giving me anticipation to see how the protagonist overcomes his next battle, sometimes I am given this awful anxiety in my heart waiting to dissipate. 
The second disappointment is that the characters aren't introduced so that you can immediately like them if you are a sensitive person like me. A few characters
                  have annoyed me because of how unsympathetic they were in a tense situation, but they have compensated later on by revealing their more tolerable character better. This is more of a problem made by the author than the studio, I believe.
The disappointments I listed above are nothing too great to effect the enjoyment of the normal watcher of this show. Watch it if you want something to binge on and some thrill and action. There isn't anything mentally sophisticated in this show: it's just kill demons, kill demons, train, and kill demons.",10,eeasuper
38000,"
                This is maybe the most beautiful shonen anime ever, but beautiful hot garbage is still hot garbage.
Absolutely awful writing on every level: flat characters; cringe-inducing attempts at humour and, most egregiously of all; a story which is constantly undermining its own stakes and sidestepping any development which might be interesting. 
The set-up is great. Tanjiro returns to his home one day to find his entire family murdered by demons - out of control, bloodthirsty monsters - except for his younger sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a demon herself. Tanjiro's goal is to restore her humanity, and to do this he has to become
                  a demon slayer, destroying these monsters while also trying to keep his monstrous sister safe. So far so good, there's great prospects for genuine emotional and moral conflict there. How does Tanjiro feel about murdering monsters which must have been once like her sister, normal, often very kind, people? How does he manage his duties while also managing Nezuko's uncontrollable bloodlust, and would be need to do anything ethically dubious to keep his beloved sister alive? Is it morally right for him to try and keep her alive while he tries to find a cure which may not actually exist, given how dangerous demons are?
The show sidesteps all of these concerns. Turns out, Nezuko isn't an out of control monster, but a NICE demon, harmless like a nonverbal child or a puppy, I guess because it's cute for her to be that way, but also because reasons. She is the only demon who can subsist on sleep, rather than blood, also because reasons. At one stage Nezuko sleeps for two years to conveniently handwave her out of the story while Tanjiro is doing a training montage ffs! And then around episode 10, which is about when I bailed, he meets two demons who are basically normal, good people, the demonic taint not making them evil like everyone else, able to live normal (albeit eternal) lives aside from not being able to go out during the day. Hey so I guess being a demon isn't really that bad then if you find a way to manage the condition, turns out there's no need to keep looking for the cure! No, he still needs to find it I guess, because reasons.
The entire show has this problem. No depth, no stakes, no character development, and everything constantly being handwaved away. Tanjiro is unfailingly kind and virtuous no matter what befalls him, but not in any sort of interesting way; more like the mangaka never really thought about how any of the horrible things he's seen might affect him other than making him a bit sad sometimes. Other characters are always dull & one note, defined by a single characteristic. Nothing which happens seems to matter very much and it's impossible to get invested.
It bears repeating how horrible the ""comedy"" is. It's always literally just people shouting.
But hey, it's beautiful and visually distinct, Nezuko has a very marketable ""mascot"" design, and it has good fight scenes if you're a fan of style and not that fussed about substance. I guess those things are all a shounen series needs to be successful!",3,HarVeeGee

                An extremely mediocre story with good animations. That would be a fair description of Kimetsu no Yaiba. This anime blew up for the amazing artwork it has and a good soundtrack to go with it. But the story and the characters are pretty poor if I'm completely honest. 
Story (4/10): A very basic story about a man called Tanjiro who wants to make his little sister human again after she became a demon in ep 1. The story from that point onwards was pretty predictable and flat. Some minor fights that didn't add anything in particular to the story and some comedic moments that were
                  mediocre at best. 
Art (10/10): Ufotable did an outstanding job in animating and adapting the manga based story. The fights are beautiful and is the main reason why this anime blew up out of proportions. The dark background with strong colors to contrast, the fights are truly something you don't see in other animes. 
Sound (8/10): A very good soundtrack that gives the audience a lot of emotions. Especially during fights, the OST makes it so much better and is above average compared to a lot of other anime. 
Character (5/10): The main character Tanjiro is probably one of the most boring characters that you will see during the course of the show. His two support characters though are funny and I think everyone agrees that Zenitsu is the best character in the show. He is well written and funny, with an annoying voice. Inosuke is a very clumsy and intense, which makes some good scenes with him as well. But for Tanjiro, he is nothing special. Just the typical shounen anime protagonist that cares for his friends and family. There is not much depth to his motives and I think that even the smallest of villains are way more interesting than Tanjiro. I tried to give him time, but his character just didn't impress me at all. 
Enjoyment (6/10): With a predictable storyline and a boring protagonist, I can not, unfortunately, give this a higher rating. I did enjoy the show, mostly because of the amazing animation by ufotable, however as I said, there was not much to it. 
Overall (6/10): Give it a try, it is only 26 episodes as of now and is worth a watch. But dont go into it with too high expectations as many of us did.",6,Killuagay

                Demon Slayer was definitely a genre defining show.
There were countless previous attempts on creating a different version of shounen genre and this show is as enjoyable as other greats (HxH and FMA). 
Demon slayer has amazing animation, story, and build up but what really surprised me was its cinematography.  In the main arc of this season, there were numerous fight scenes where clever use of camera and transitions got me super engaged in the  moment.  
Characters in first season were nothing spectacular, but it seems like the show will introduce most of its cast in the upcoming seasons and I am excited
                  to see how each new characters will develop.
Music, in classic Ufotable fashion was amazing, gave me goosebumps and was often what define a scene from a good to a great scene.
This is overall an amazing anime as it can easily be a gateway anime (has lighthearted moments, great fights, animation) and is so enjoyable. Would recommend to anyone that has the time to watch.

                I'm new to anime and the shonen genre so I watched this with an outsider's perspective compared to many other viewers. 
First off, the show is very enjoyable to watch. The story flows smoothly and there isn't an episode in this first season that's dull.
The art and animation is absolutely beautiful and sound design was spectacular.
That being said, the character tropes were a little stereotypical, espescially Zenitsu as a shitty, comic-relief character. I kind of despise him.
The story itself was the basic hero's journey.
Nonetheless, the actual show is very fun to watch and I can't watch for the upcoming film!

                Demon Slayer has spectacular animation, a great story, and amazing characters. I love this anime a lot and I think that it is one of the best I've personally ever seen. I found myself unable to stop watching the show after I had started it, I was instantly encapsulated. One of my favorite things is the characters, you see a lot of growth in most of the characters. I found myself really connected to all of them. The only gripe I might have is that Zenitsu is over the top at times and was really annoying, but that might be intentional. I can't wait for
                  Season 2 of Demon Slayer, I feel like everything has made sense thus far. I also really like the backstories given on each character, and that even most demons get some good depth to them, often making you feel for the demons even though they are the villains in the show.

                I picked up this anime after I saw a review raving about its animation quality and creativity during fight scenes. This turned out to be incredibly true, and is good enough to keep my interest. However the incredible art is the only aspect that carries this anime and makes it enjoyable.
The story itself is a little bland, though that's not necessarily a bad thing for a straightforward Shounen. The show's biggest weakness lies in its immature attempts at humor. Specifically any scene involving Agatsuma Zenitsu will have him whine, scream, mope and cry. In an otherwise serious and mildly gory anime, these incongruous scenes get
                  overdone really quickly and will detract from your enjoyment. Of course other characters will serve as comedic relief from time to time, and those moments are quite more enjoyable.
Overall this Shounen is definitively worth checking out if you value beautiful art styles or cool fight scenes. Its creative direction is a cut above most other Shounen you've seen. Just don't expect it to stand out in any other way.",7,H0henheim0fLight

                A Masterpiece. 
All the negative reviews or sub-7 star reviewers nitpick and only focus on the smallest, insignificant things ever. You don't see any of them talking about details such as the incredible soundtrack during emotional scenes.
Absolutely the BEST anime I've watched up to date. I teared up multiple times during this anime. Incredible artwork/animation, character development, soundtrack, and storyline. Every episode flowed so smooth and I just kept wanting more and not stopping until I inevitably binged the whole thing. NOT A SINGLE EPISODE WAS BORING.
I regret not have seen this earlier when it came out. I now realize how hyped this anime is.

                I believe that, along with Attack On Titan, Demon Slayer is one of the all-time must-watch series. It really is not so good on the story part because it's quite simple: just kill the demons. But sometimes simplicity is a good thing. The main character, Tanjiro, is not a cliche main character and really cares for the people around him, including the demons. The characters are simple but great because Tanjiro and Nezuko are extremely kind and the evil characters are evil. Ubayashiki and the pillars are harsh on Tanjiro so he can improve. While much of the story is a bit boring and just
                  fighting, the animation and sound are great and it works well with the action-themed story. The thing that sets it apart from the rest of the action genre is that there are so many beautiful and calm settings in between the fights and after the fights. Each demon has their own story and, like Tanjiro, we can see where their motivation comes from and feel bad for them, even if the act of killing is unforgivable. It will give you goosebumps.
Note: This review also applies to the Mugen Train movie and most likely the rest of the series when it comes out.",10,ChristinoSim

                Why is Demon Slayer Bad?? or Zombie Slayer Well, that should be easy to understand but If you don't I'll try to explain. Just boring generic predictable shounen trash that's all. There is nothing unique or interesting about this story if you have seen any other shounen then you have already seen Demon Slayer it's like a hurricane from every Shounen and thrown into one anime in a straight line heading for disaster. This show has nothing original, zero creativity. This is basically my hero academia, attack on titan/ Tokyo ghoul thrown into one series and tons of other shounen series it could and just
                  ripped them off.
Story(1): The story follows some goodie happy to be alive character that comes home and finds his family to savagely murdered by demons, and the only surviving family member is his sister due to plot armor. Due to his surprise, she is attacked by a demon slayer because that's his job he slays demons. people always talk about cliche anime this is one of them. A demon slayer of the highest rank(we the audience didn't know at the start of the anime he was but now after watching it we know he's the highest rank) comes along to slay a demon but because the main character cried and then somehow persuades him to let his sister live. However then this mysterious dude for whatever reason which was never explain said ""why not imma let you guys off the hook and while we're at it ill send you a guy were then he can train you to then become a demon slayer, HEYHEY imma just hand out golden passes today any demon can live"" its like WHAT I have seen some cliche things but this is the icing on the cliche cake. Just so unrealistic I was laughing while watching because of how stupid it was. THE MAN IS TRAINED TO KILL DEMONS but just because the main character cried and whimpered it's that easy to persuade him TRASH TRASH. JUST ANOTHER  Shounen here we go again.
It's so infuriating to watch this. Why do PEOPLE PRAISE this to high heaven? And the 
 2 plots of the story are to get his sister back to human and get revenge for his family.  2 very stupid plots one because the first plot is unrealistic we know demons can talk and we know they don't need to attack humans we seen this in the 2 kind demons that helped the main character and his sister. Then there's the typical training arc trying to go to the academy always have the academy.  Again the main character gets everything handed to him from the author due to plot convenience, and the typical shounen of the never give up and things come my way
Characters(1) The other characters in the anime are HORRIBLE the other protagonist with yellow hair, a loser that cries all the time. Then only character worth watching was the bore guy. And then his sister one of the most hyped-up characters ever ""oh shes soo amazing MY WAFU"" NOO  she only comes out when the plot needs her whether it's for fanservice or too just be there, she serves no real purpose there other demons more interesting than her. The main character is so boring to watch everyone else is dying to these very powerful ""zombies"" (cause demons don't eat humans they possess them) and he just walks up and spams op abilities over and over. Never for a second was I left in suspense NEVER.
Art(3): Something else people were hyping up. Seems to me if an anime has vibrant colors, flashing lights, it makes it good NOOOOO, I have seen anime for 2008 that Looks better than this. Because the show was so horribly done it felt like a kids show well its a Shounen so it is. Demons didn't even look intimidating for a show that got an insane budget its sad to say it was a waste. 
Overall(1): Final thoughts the main character that gets everything handed to him. We all know how bad Shounen can be, with the lack of creativity and depth but this Shounen is something different IT BRINGS ZERO CREATIVITY or DEPTH. The plot instantly cured my Insomnia. The same soundtrack was spammed throughout the entire series. The animation was far from good. This story shouldn't even be called a story I've seen henti with better plots then Demon Slayer. With the amount of hype, its getting makes zero sense.",1,Fierrza

                I remember being unsure to see this, as I normally don't pay attention to top rated shows by their number, and give it a shot when I'm interested. But having a few friends loving it, made me curious. So I gave it a shot, and like my friends, loved it. Demon Slayer really is quite the anime that I recommend to anyone.
The cast of characters are great. Even ones that didn't seem like much at first, suddenly turned out to be great characters in their own right. The overall theme is just something I adore. From the settings, backgrounds, to the sound in general. It's
                  really pleasing.

                This anime never really caught my eye at first, but now that I've watched it, it's like wow this was amazing definitely one of my top ten animes now like this was unbelievable. 
Story: This was kind of a basic story nothing really stuck out to me like tragic event happens that sends the protagonist on a great and dangerous adventure to try and solve his problems, but however the history of the world the anime takes place in is actually unique and does stand out to me when i was watching it because sure I've seen things like it, but this one puts a
                  different spin to it and stuck out. 
Art: The art was amazing like it was unbelievable when its just the basic characters standing and talking to each other to the studio creating 3D models as they run that makes it very unique, but the major part is the fight scenes for this anime like WOW just watching it for this animation makes me want to see more of this and continue to watch it as much as possible. 
Characters: The characters themselves are different in their own ways while having some similarities, but what I like about the difference between characters is obviously great differences between them such as hair styles and what caught my eye was the hashira which are the elite demon slayers and they are all so cool, but haven't had screen time so I'm hoping to see more of them in demon slayer season 2.
Overall: This anime was a great watch and i can't wait for season 2 and i need to find a place where i can stream the movie.",9,MasterBuck325

                Ugh. I am gonna say it now. This show is an overrated piece of garbage that had the potential to be not.
The story starts with Kamado family bonding then fast forward, they are killed by a demon and while they are killed the MC, Tanjiro was away. When he got back, he was shocked. Nezuko, the only survivor of the attack, was on the verge on dying then she became a demon. Giyu arrives at the scene to kill the demon, which is Nezuko, so he and Tanjiro fought a bit but in the end, because this garbage is so unoriginal, Giyu spares Nezuko for no
                  logical reason. After that, Tanjiro then made a resolve. REVENGE!!(Ugh. Cringe level over 9000). Then *drum roll* DEMON SLAYER!!! Wow! What a terrible premise but the fans said ""iT gEtS bEtTeR fRoM hErE"" so I pushed through.
First, we enter a generic training arc that only has animation (the blinded A LOT of people) as its redeeming factor. There is a part here that show how poor the storytelling of the show is. We see Tanjiro training with Sabito and Makomo. Shing shing sword fight then at the end, Tanjiro and Sabito had a clichè final sword slash. Tanjiro appeared to cut the mask of Sabito but then few shots later the stone the he cannot cut at the earlier part of the arc was cut in half. It was revealed then that Sabito and Makomo are actually dead. So my question is all this time was the rock moving and having a sword fight with Tanjiro? Such a poorly written and told fight.
Then it was revealed that Nezuko was sleeping all the time and apparently sleeping makes up for hunger. Ugh. Fucking wasted potential development. Instead of giving Nezuko internal struggles of suppressing hunger and developing her from there, we get this lazy ass writing that Sakonji used an off screen hypnosis so that Nezuko won't eat humans. Clap, clap, clap.
Development: Am I a joke to you?
We could have been shown clips of Nezuko eating animals to supress her hunger and at some point make a conflict between her and Tanjiro but no the author is lazy af. This could've made her an interesting and compelling character but now she is just a cardboard of an character that is mostly used for cringe ass fanservice. nEzUkO kAwAiI.
Then after the training arc, we go to the final selection. There we had the first villain, the green-giant-slime guy. Typical. Tanjiro was struggling at first then at the end he wins despite not being strong enough and what is worse is that the ones with Tanjiro also undergo almost the same or exactly the same amount of training as him. Nonsensical power scaling. But there is a larger problem here. While training, Tanjiro is shown to only use normal sword attacks but during the fight suddenly he can use Water Breathing attacks that are NOT shown during the training. Sure he was also practicing his actual breathing but how does it become a Water Breathing attack was never shown. So in other words, the techniques he use (from Breathing 1-10) are like asspulls. This show uses the training arc in the worst way possible.
After that we had a few missions of Tanjiro and Nezuko fighting demons. After all those fights, the show tries to make you feel sad for the demons but the execution (at least to me) is so bad , especially with the drums demon. I jUsT wAnT sOmEoNe tO hEaR mE!!!, that instead of making me sad, it makes me laugh and cringe at the same time. Their flashbacks are to edgy for me. Like please, give your villains variety. Have a demon that is just a villain till the end. Don't make them all people with sad past. It gets tiring fast.
Episode 19 is trash. Its writing is Fairy Tail writing. ""Hinokami Kagura"" is one of the biggest asspulls of the year. Water user becoming able to use Fire (without training) in the verge of being killed is one of the worst moments of 2019. After Tanjiro ""beheading"" Rui, the author tries to make his failure weigh lighter so he made a Diabolus Ex Machina for Rui. He actually beheaded himself before Tanjiro can cut him so that it won't look like Fairy Tail. Wow so forced. Author-san if you think you got out of the shithole, NO! It just shows how poorly written this show is. Nezuko using Demon Arts despite sleeping 80% of the time and also without training is also an offender.
I almost forgot the two horrendous main characters, Inosuke and Zenitsu. Two characters with little to no development and are just there for ""comedic"" relief but they are pure annoyances. Inosuke was just too bland for me to care so....meh but Zenitsu......He is easily one of the worst characters in 2019. His character is to be annoying. Shouting here, fainting there. Funny? HELL NO!! His power is pure Deus Ex Machina and is not ashamed to hide it.
We have better revenge stories out there like Vinland Saga, which is now my gold standard for revenge stories. The author knows what he wants to do. He makes Thorfinn look pathetic because he wants to get his message across to the viewers. Revenge is stupid and a waste of time. By Episode 22 of VS, this message was sent across perfectly. That scream from Thorfinn realizing he wasted years of his life for revenge was well done. Back to Kimestu no Yaiba, revenge here is taken in such a shallow way. Revenge is just an excuse for Tanjiro's fight with demons to have ""weight"" but it has little to none, at least to me.
Like every 10/10 anime has flaws, a 1/10 anime also has positives. Kimetsu no Yaiba is no exception. The last episode (Muzan killing the lower moons) was actually pretty solid. That's it. Omegalul. Bye. Peace. Signing Out.
Anything not mentioned, is either a clichè moment that didn't really piss me off or a forgettable moment.

Story:4 
So the plot is quite unique, sure, but why is the execution horrible? While using a fairly unique plot for a mainstream shounen, it all goes down the drain with the repetitive formula of ""crow comes, tells Tanjiro where to go, Tanjiro kills the demon, crow comes, tells him where to go, kills the demon"" and it goes on in this cycle.How can you say that the demons have been there for 5000 years and then go on to show the damn leader of the demons in the 7th episode. Demons since 5000 years would only mean that the demons
                  are widespread and quite self-explanatory about the world but the author really decided to mess that up and gave  by showing that the leader of the demons is in the same region/state/land as Tanjiro and that all the other 12 of the higher level demons are in the same state etc as Tanjiro as well it just doesn't add up. It's a big mess of a world building. This was such a waste of a unique plot that the author could come up with. For me PERSONALLY these kind of series heavily depend on the world building and the author wanted to I guess break that norm? Even the ""best"" part of the series had flaws although very much enjoyable, think about it? how was Tanjiro about to slice Rui's neck with a broken sword when just a minute before that his sword got sliced by his string.....STRINGS
Art: 10
Outstanding art no doubt about that. The animation in terms of movements doesn't come on the same level as Mob Psycho but the water from the sword and the flames and all those stuffs are unique and satisfying af
Sound: 9
Amazing opening and a top class ost in the 19th episode. Tbh I enjoyed the Tanjiro vs Rui more because of the ost rather than the animation.
Character: 4
uh, ok. Tanjiro and Nezuko have a magnificent bond and their dynamics are fantastic. I only had a single problem with Tanjiro and that was empathy for the demons. The same demons that were ruthlessly slaughtering humans for who knows how many years and you're right there before them feeling for the .....demons? I do however appreciate the authors abilities to be able to get the feelings through to the viewers but this was just wasted by using it with the wrong characters and the wrong time why? why did Zenitsu have to be there? why did Inosuke have to be there? what's the point of them here? they're literally earrape. Zenitsu was definitely cool when he was asleep nut it's all overshadowed by his appalling comedy. Now demon slayer fans defend these two by saying they're comic relief but there's a place and time for that. Their fellow demon slayers just got slaughtered by the demons and Zenitsu is panicking doing his horrific comedy and there's Inosuke doing the Luffy's name pronunciation but failing with it. And the way he does it, the way they both do their comedy is just contradictory to its ""dark fantasy"" world.
Enjoyment: 5
Now this might've been up to a 7 if the series didn't waste time in the ast 4-5 episodes. I also didn't enjoy the world building and a few inconsistenciesbut this could've been overlooked. It were Zenitsu and Inosuke who were the real buzz killers . There really wasn't any need for them to be added along with a passionate character like Tanjiro honestly. I enjoyed the fight scenes and the ost  quite a lot.
Overall: 6.4
""Fair"" is what it gets. Animation sound fights  and the bond of Tanjiro and Nezuko keeps it on a safe 6 i guess. If anyone is considering watching it, then go ahead, you will enjoy it when the movie is about to come out because of hype and animation. It's a massive hit despite of its flaws so it won't be bad to check it out. If you're into fight scenes you can check it out. I personally recommend it for people to check out how to use an good OST with good animation. But if you're looking for something of a dark-fantasy, then stay away from this, I repeat, stay away!",6,ahjhj1717

                The newest seasonal by ufotable? The OP by LiSA? SiGn Me Up RiGhT nOw!
And Kimetsu no Yaiba has not disappointed. Ufotable has really dug into their unlimited budget into making this anime, and they produced, imo, one of the best anime this season. The art style is unique and bold, similar to AoT season 1 with clean, thick lines. The animation by ufotable, is as always, near movie level and harmonizes excellently with the art. 
The execution of Kimetsu no Yaiba, is without a doubt, amazing. The camera work and 360 rotation during epic battle scenes, the sound effects with every slash and hit, and
                  the small details that are painstakingly folded into each episode accentuate the anime. Each OST in the scenes always convey the right emotion, all while sticking to classic historical Japanese songs in the period which the story takes place. In addition, the twist of modern instrumentals give them the fantastical element that makes them truly beautiful. 
The choreography is so awe-inspiring that it deserves its own paragraph. I'm not sure if many people have noticed it yet, but the voice actors really put passion and heart into their characters. For example, in one scene where Urokodaki is sending Tanjiro off to the Final Selection, he talks about a boy's growing appetite. If one listens closely, they can actually hear the amusement in his voice, showing how much work the VA put into his character. Tanjiro's tears sounded and felt completely real when disaster struck, unlike the embarrassing screaming that other VA's have in other animes.
Each story has their flaws, and Kimetsu no Yaiba is not immune to this. The story and character falls a little flat. While the setting of the anime is interesting, the way the story progresses is predictable, as it follows the Shonen model complete with a call to action, a training arc, and a test of worthiness. The characters also fall victim to this, as they are, at their core, Shonen stereotypes. Urokodaki is the sensei that doesn't want to let his student go, Tanjiro is a classic Shonen protagonist that wants to protect everyone after starting off weak and becoming strong.
In the end, I can only rave so much about Kimetsu no Yaiba. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and always look forward to the next episode every week. I rate it 10/10, and hope you enjoy it as much as I do, shoud you choose to watch it.",10,guysomeone0

Overall I can say that its a show definitely worth watching. Story was not too overly complex. Comedy scenes were good. Ending was satisfying. I guess there were some episodes where other characters besides the main one Tanjirou had their pasts explained. OST was worth listening to. I think even non-Shonen fans might enjoy this show. Very epic. The first season was very interesting. Show didn't really have a narrator I think. Some of the villains did have motivations for their actions.

                If you like BNHA and/or FMA then you'll probably like this show too. Why? Because it's just the same generic shounen anime but with different themes.
Story: Antagonist who's bad for the sake of being bad need to be defeated by protag to protect the world. That's the gist of it. While there was an underlying motive of revenge, it's completely buried by the sense of duty the protag has to protect other people. There was also the ""I'm fighting for my family"" spiel that give the protag the power to beat the bad guys. Overall it's just so generic and bland.
Art: Just generic art overall
                  with a few exceptions. The animation quality is top notch, as to be expected with Ufotable. One might even say that the only thing the show has going for it was the animation. Overall it's pretty good from an animation standpoint
Sound: I don't really know much about the sound cause I don't care much for the sound and music themes.
Character:(Spoilers I think) The only character I really liked in this show was Shinobu, who was the strong but airhead character (like Shizuku Murasaki). Nezuko was also good but I can't really say I liked her because of her character. Other than that almost everyone was irredeemably bad. Tanjiro was just a standard bland protagonist (like Midoriya). Inosuke was just angry all the time for no reason at all (like Bakugo). Zenitsu was just a wimpy dude (like Usopp but worse cause Usopp was actually a good character). Overall the characters are worse than in BNHA.
Enjoyment: Again the only reason I watched it to the end was cause the animation was so good. Other than that it's just boring. The jokes and tropes were bland, the fight scenes were lackluster, you can't connect with any of the characters. 
Overall: I watched caused they said it's good, and I stayed cause of the animation. 3/10",1,shadow0130

                Demon Slayer is the most overhyped piece of garbage to have ever been created , it does absolutely new , it is just recycling the generic shonen garbage formula.
The only reason and I MEAN THE ONLY REASON why people dickride this series so much is because of the animation and if i'm being completely honest it isn't even all that great. 
Safe to say that this series has the most toxic fanbase , they have the mental capacity of a fucking peanut , giving undeserved hype to trash episodes
The story is predictable and corny , it follows a boy who wants to turn his sister
                  back into a human even though she is a demon she still retains her human personality thanks to the power of plot and if things couldn't get any worse a DEMON SLAYER let her go and told her brother to go to a man that will train him to become a demon slayer , like this whole story is so forced and contrived , Nothing makes  sense 
Tanjiro isn't even a swordsman , he's just a guy who carries a sword  , whenever he's in a fight there is no strategy or skill required to win , he just spams his random ass breathing powers 
The side characters also are just bland and one-dimensional , there is nothing complex about them , they're just there to fill up space
The fact that a series that does absolutely nothing or unique receives so much hype really shows the decay of the anime community , the toxic demographic of this series constantly look for ways to suck it off by comparing it to trash series like MHA , Black Clover , Boruto etc just makes no sense . That's like comparing a pile of shit to a pile of shit with a cherry on top",1,FaxTuaL

                I was recommended this by pretty much everyone I knew. You see, demon slayer has become the attack on titan of 2020: you ask your classmate what anime they've watched, they only mention Demon Slayer. You ask them what their favorite anime is: the answer doesn't change. Every baby otaku has watched it, and convincing them it's not as great as they think it is, is like convincing them SAO is trope filled and generic. They will never listen. The difference between SNK and Demon Slayer is that SNK actually deserved the hype. This anime was a great disappointment to me. 
The story: 1
The plot
                  is extremely repetitive. They wanted to go for a sob story that introduces each characters tragic back story, which would then prompt there being a really sad and deep conclusion to the arc, though it didn't work. Each villain was less interesting than the next, which is awful because of how it was the only thing Demon Slayer had going for it plot wise. 
The terrible writing doesn't stop there, because the comedy is atrocious. If this was a try to laugh challenge, then I've miserably failed. The comedy heavily relied on the characters being quirky and extremely loud to be funny. The vast majority of the jokes were basically Zenitsu being a wimp for the fifth hundredth time and running around while screaming obnoxiously like a chicken that'd lost it's head. I found myself craving his silence throughout the entire show, knowing that sadly, it would never come. 
With this, the writing overall was dull and I couldn't care less for the plot. But maybe the writing for the characters would be better right?
Character: 0
As stated, all the characters were flat with no real personalities or likability. The characters rely on their obnoxiousness to serve as their personalities. They do not have any other character traits. The only one that seems sane is Tanjiro, but he has no real character flaws and when you pair that with his self righteousness, I suddenly begin to prefer Zenitsu's screeching. 
The characters are literally split into two categories: sane but flat and uninteresting, or so loud and obnoxious you want to rip your ears off. Not a single one is dynamic in any way, which coupled with the meaningless plot, crippled my ability to even so much as slightly enjoy this anime.

The art is stunning and the animation is extremely smooth and well executed. This being said, just because an anime has great animation, doesn't mean that I'm going to forget about how terribly boring it was.

It was decent, I don't think it was very memorable though (despite what most have said). I'm of course not counting the opening, I think Gurenge is awesome and LiSA continues to amaze me.

I usually can stick through a lot, but I hit episode seventeen and all of my will to keep going had left me. I hated everything about it, but I still forced myself through episode twenty six... and for what? Honestly, I don't know.

No matter if its story character or sound you will enjoy every bit of it every episode of it. This anime is one of the best anime I ever watched.
I really recommend everyone to watch it.

                I'd like to start off by saying that if you genuinely think that this anime deserves the amount of hype and attention that it recieved you may have a bit more than a screw loose in your head. This anime is disgustingly average, made clearly to appeal to the more edgy shounen fanbase who want to seem more mature as they are into violence - basically your standard 12 year old tokyo ghoul fan. 
Firstly, the concept is really not anything special, a combination of your regular man eating monster shtick, combined with an overused, boring sword-wielding MC, definetely something new and original. 
Speaking of
                  original, let's talk about the power system. Firstly it doesn't make sense to me how anybody thinks this is cool, especially considering this is part of the shounen genre - the power system should have been must more interesting, instead of some stupid breathing technique. Despite how bland the power system was, it did seem to have originality on its side - or so I thought, until i watched JoJo's bizarre adventure part 1 and realized that the power system was completely plagarised from JJBA. So, all in all the power system has absolutely nothing going for it, adding to the growing list of reasons why this anime is average at best. 
Now, onto the characters. The main character is your standard feminine coward of an MC that somehow manages to fight his way through villains due to massive power ups and the help of his nakama, reminiscent of Mirai Nikki's Yukiteru - again very original. As a character himself, despite receiving a fair amount of development he seems awfully similar to deku(just with less tears) on top the same boring cliche of dead family and revenge repeated an endless amount of times - not only in shounen anime but the entertainment industry as a whole - once again - ORIGINAL. 
The art and animation were admittedly the one factor of this anime that i would say actually deserved the hype they received, they were pulled off very nicely, the fight scenes were pleasing to watch - despite weak choreography. 
All in all, i see no reason why this anime has any more appeal than any other standard shounen anime, there is nothing - apart from the art that works in its favour to make it any better.

                Shounen done right. The best of the genre.
Kimetsu No Yaiba is a series I have been waiting a long time for. I have been following the manga for the past few years now and was really excited when I found out it would be getting an anime adaption by Ufotable. Like the story, the first few episodes start out pretty slow, laying the groundwork for the amazing scenes/battles to come. But, once KNY gets going, it gets fucking going. There's absolutely gorgeous animation, honestly top 5 animated series I have ever seen. The music is impeccable, OP by LiSa is a regular in my daily
                  music rotation, character designs are unique and actually pretty damn accurate for the Taisho era. Fights are done in breathtaking detail with a mix of hand drawn animation and CGI. Plot is original, fresh and not too overwhelming. 
Honestly, this is the perfect shounen. It's got everything you could want. Action, Music, Quality Animation, fast paced, etc. Episode 19 catapulted the series into unimaginable heights and while I am glad that it is getting more attention, I also kinda miss it being a niche series. That said, Kimetsu No Yaiba is not only one of the easiest 10s I have ever given, but also my choice for Anime of the Year. Been saying it for months and now others are finally listening. Watch it and make your own choice.",10,Marinate1016

                This, my friends, is the best Touhou anime I've never seen!
But ok, jokes aside, this anime is more beautiful than I've expected. No amount of trailers will give it enough justice in that regard.
I love the thick lines, so it's very much up my alley. The animation is simply outstanding. A lot of interesting decisions, like, for example, sometimes it goes first-person for extra immersion. You get used to CGI very fast. It has fantastic, original effects, beautiful intermissions, really creepy demon designs and characters that look unique.
There is blood and gore, which is good. Limbs fly around quite often and blood sprays even more
                  so. Characters don't mind though, they just brush it off without as much as a scream and keep fighting. Oh well... that's just genre conventions.
Some things, however, are censored. Which is weird. Because sometimes censorship is there and sometimes isn't. I just don't know how they decided what warrants it. That said, when it's there, it's still stylish.
So, visually, this anime is absolutely amazing, one of the best I've ever seen, no doubt.
The composer is Yuki Kajiura, so... to no one's surprise, the soundtrack will give you goosebumps because of how breathtakingly atmospheric it is. Nothing else to add here. Masterpiece.
The episodes are a little empty. It's like nothing has happened yet, and it already ended. And that ending is often abrupt, with no cliffhanger or a defined ending scene. I would honestly go crazy if I was watching it as an ongoing instead of binging. 
Besides, at this point I'm so used to great anime that don't waste time on typical ""previously on..."" scenes that just the fact that they were present in Kimetsu no Yaiba was disheartening. I was just sitting there thinking ""why did you just waste two and a half minutes?""
Now to the juicy part, story and dialogues. 
Oh boy... 
They were so poor, I'm not sure words I want to use to describe them will be approved by moderators.
And I really can't explain how infuriatingly dumb they are without going into spoilers, but let's just say I can rant about them for hours and it will get heated, because I hate them THAT much.
I'll give you one example. One dialogue without context, so it's not much of a spoiler, but if you don't want even that much, just skip the next paragraph.
So, one character asks another what year it is. Assuming that he has lost count of time at this point. He didn't get the answer besides the fact that the era has changed (meaning it is a different emperor on the throne now). No dates. Not way of knowing how many emperors have changed. Nothing. And so, literally in the next line he starts saying: ""I will never forget that day, 47 years ago..."" 
Seriously? SERIOUSLY? I mean, come on, this is an extremely amateurish mistake.
There is a lot of exposition and not of a fun variety, just stupid. Explanations like ""this sword is made of special metal"", ""this clothing is made of special cloth"", ""this mask is protected by special charms"" - this all sounds like a kindergartner wrote the story.
There are just too many things like this. Writing in this anime is offensively stupid.
Humor... well... let's just say, it's the same as the rest of the writing. Stupid. And if in the first few episodes it looks kinda cute, later it just becomes annoying. At one point I just started skipping their comedic routine to get back to the main story, because I understood that if I struggled through one more scene like that I just won't be able to finish this anime. It's really that bad.
The characters are one-dimensional and don't go beyond one personality quirk.
   Tanjiro, the protagonist, is weirdly enough the best of the bunch. He is not your typical shonen hero. He doesn't scream, doesn't rush and he's very kind. But it's not a stupid type of kindness that stands between him and his mission. It doesn't look phony at all, but instead creates some of the most emotional moments in the series. I also love the way he talks to kids. He manages to make child characters way less annoying than they usually are.
   Nezuko... exists. And that makes internet happy. I mean... it makes me happy too. But doesn't make her a good character at all. She has about zero development. But she's undeniably cute. Also, please, put something soft into her box, I just don't want to think how much it hurts inside with all the running, jumping, spinning, swimming that Tanjiro does.
   The antagonist is... described by one of the characters the best - he is a coward. And, to be honest, he is quite pathetic. Which makes watching him a really dull experience.
   Shinobu is great. I need way more battles with her. I want to know if there are any to be expected from season 2, because this could be the deciding factor in whether I'll watch it or not. She's just that cool.
   And then Zenitsu happened. And... I'll be honest, I almost dropped this anime the moment he opened his mouth. His level of annoyance is at the level of the worst One-Piece characters. And I'm saying this as a person who actually enjoys One-Piece. Stupid, loud, whiny comedic relief.
Sure, he has his moments. In fact, I'll go as far as to say he has some of the most epic moments in this anime. But they are way too few to tolerate him all the other time. Which is a shame because he was the character I was most looking forward to the moment I saw his design.
   Finally, while I mostly found Inosuke annoying, I just have to give props to his voice actor. He was so good with all the screaming I couldn't believe when I saw his name. It's the same guy who voiced protagonists of Sword Art Online and Danmachi. Like... holy hell... I'm impressed, I would've never guessed it was him. Bravo! I think I found my new favorite male voice actor. 
In the end, Kimetsu no Yaiba is an empty show in a gorgeous wrapper. Because of that wrapper and the main idea behind the show, I managed to watch it to the end (of the first season). But at one point it became such a painful experience because of the whole stupidity of dialogues and story, that I couldn't recommend it to anyone else in good faith.
The writer's skill was so poor that it didn't just become an average show with some plot holes and tropes you can forgive. It actively worked against everything this show was doing right. You can see that she (writer) had amazing ideas, but lacked the talent to put them together. These ideas - points A, B, C in the story - are marvelous. But everything between is just atrocious. Sometimes you're watching a moment of unmatched beauty, both visually and emotionally, and are thinking - there it is, fantastic, gorgeous, breathtaking! And everything in that moment of silent visual storytelling is clear without words... but then the moment keeps dragging, they add words: start talking about exposition, backstory, put a completely unnecessary comment from the heroes. And all you can do is sit there and think: ""No, please, stop, not now, it was so perfect""... But alas, the moment is gone.
And this is what ruined Kimetsu no Yaiba for me. And I'm just upset that such a potential was ruined. By lack of talent or just lack of experience - it doesn't matter.
The writing quality killed this anime.",6,HaremRoute

                Alrighty, my first ever review. After consuming right about 60 days worth of anime, I finally ended up feeling the need to write a review. Why now? Why this show? Well, I felt I had to. This show is very interesting in a way to me, in the sense that it does a number of things really well, but a plethora of things outstandingly terrible. But let's get down to the nitty gritty. This review will contain some spoilers in order to support some of my points.
Let's begin with the great elements: The animation. The animation is honestly gorgeous. I don't need to tell you
                  how good the 2D animation in the show is, it speaks for itself. What I do need to talk about is the blending of 2D and 3D. I was told that some of the CGI would not blend in that well with the 2D in the show, but I disagree completely. This show does this blend extremely well, the action scenes float so naturally as we one screen setup jump from 2D to 3D and back again in the next screen setup in order to create extremely dynamic camera angles. I would honestly say that the untrained eye would miss most of the 3D used, since it is so seamless.
Similarly, the beginning of the story is executed quite well IMO. They don't exactly reinvent the wheel, a shonen protagonist loses their family in order to start their journey, but what I think really worked for me here was the very nonchalant way Tanjiro interacts with his family before the incident occurs. It doesn't try to hammer down our throats how much he loves his family and how much his siblings love him. Neither it is too vague to care about. It hits a nice balanced where it feels organic to me.
Next up, the power system! I like the system used in this show. There is devoted a good amount of time to establish and showcase how it works, and it feels relatively grounded, as it's just breathing.
I think that about covers it for the good parts, time to be negative :(.
The comedy in this show sucks and is causing immense amounts of mood problems. There is a huge issue with the type of comedy which the show tries to employ and it really hurts quite a few scenes in which the serious tone is just eviscerated by some of the god awful running gags in the show. I'm talking scenes where we have Inosuke in the background of a serious conversation running into a tree repeatedly. I'm talking Zenitsu yelling about how he is going to die and how he doesn't want to die even though he isn't proactively trying to avoid dying. And I'm talking interrupting the rehabilitation and spending a good 2 minutes of screen time for Zenitsu to tell the other 2 guys that they aren't allowed to complain about the training being hard because there are women present... The comedy boils down to some awful running gags as well as some out of the blue loud reactions and yelling, because LOL RANDOM.
This leads me to the characters. They are not good... most of them have one trait which isn't that uncommon for a shonen show to use minimalistic characters, however most of the characters in this show is used solely for either a running gag or looking and being menacing. The few characters that aren't cutboards does sadly not pick up the slack. Tanjiro starts out as a likable hero, but rapidly falls into a pit of a way too pure moral compass that usually interferes with his common sense and over the course of the show he devolves into a boring flavorless goody 2 shoes. Inosuke yells a lot and it gets pretty stale rather quickly. His badass look and fierce demeanor doesn't really make up for the fact that he is just a loud idiot. Speaking of loud idiots, Zenitsu is possibly one of the most unlikable characters I've ever seen. He yells, he cries, he cower and then he yells some more. He is secretly very strong and badass when in a trance-like state, which for some reason is supposed to make up for the other 90% of his screen time where he is so unbearable that it makes me wanna stab out my eye sockets as well as my ears, so I don't have to look or listen to him anymore, which if you couldn’t guess it, does not make up for it. I was overwhelmed with joy as he was laying on a tree limb about to die from poison, but alas he lived and my hope died instead. I did enjoy our big villain though. There was a bit of mystery around him, but we got to see glimpses of who he is and why he does what he does, which I think really added to him as a character and made him feel rounded. The last one I want to address is Nezuko. She is... kinda just there. She is cute at times and she had that semi cool moment against that ball demon and that's about it. She can shrink in size to suit her mood, but with a skip and a hop she is not one cool kong :/ .
And up next is the structure and pacing of the show. The pacing is decent in the first 6 or 7 episodes. We get a good balanced of action, exposition and story. After this point, however, the pacing dives faster than Hans Hass and episodes gets flooded with an enormous amount of filler. Many of the otherwise great fight scenes gets plagued with a lot of waiting. We see Tanjiro fumbling around the fight not using any of the techniques he has trained to use for these types of situations, get injured and then right before he is done for, he uses one of the techniques and kills the demon. Then we get a good 10 minutes of back story for the demon that died, which might have had more impact if we knew it before he died, since now we don't care.. he's dead. The structure is weird. Halfway through the show it turns into what can best be described as an episode template from a bad season of the walking dead. The episodes in this portion of the show usually plays out this exact way every time: rerunning the final 3 minutes of the previous episode(not recap, the exact same footage), then a brief resolution of the conflict, 3-6 minutes of nothing happening, a slight build to something happening, another 3-6 minutes of nothing happening and then a cliffhanger ending so you have to watch the next episode, but fuck you because not only does the momentum gets derailed by seeing the same footage again, but after a quick resolution it's back to boredom city with you. The combination of this pacing as well as the structure makes it nearly impossible to stay engaged for a full 20 minutes, even when some of the action scenes are really dope.
If I'm being honest you could probably teach a master class on how not to tell and build a story from this show, there are so many fundamental elements of story telling that it fails to execute correctly.
Lastly, why did we need a moment in which Tanjiro conveniently remembers that his father in Tanjiro’s childhood used a breathing technique far superior to the one he has been trained in... like the levels of deus ex machina here are astronomical.
Overall I think 3 is fair score when considering all the aspects of the show which drags it down. I'm a firm believer in the idea that no amount of visuals or animation can safe a show that is extremely flawed in the characters and story department, and thus I don't consider the animation a redeeming quality if that is the majority of what a show has to offer.",3,umarudesuwa

                *very minor spoilers*
What I've written here is more like a warning than an actual review.
The story starts off fairly mundane, The main character (Tanjiro) is leaving home from his daily routine of selling rocks or something. He does this literally everyday but for some reason when his family says goodbye to him they have to act like he's going out to war... like he's going to be gone for a fucking decade. The reason for this is so the writer won't have to properly establish the relationship between Tanjiro and his family. Instead of giving proper screentime to his family, they present them as the
                  most loving family of all time. The reason for this because they have to die like 7 minutes later so they have to seem like the a super loving family for the short time that they have. 
The show sells itself on being insanely well animated and for the whole series we have to stay in some CGI PS2 looking ass world, and not even a pretty PS2 game like Kingdom Hearts or something, I mean like some straight up GTA San Andreas level looking world. So while the characters look great, the backdrops themselves look like- well... San Andreas.
A very major problem is the literal constant narration, it's almost as if the narrator was solely meant for blind people who can't see, all he ever does is just explain what's happening on screen, like... the animation is good enough to the point where I don't need some SpongeBob voiced kid (no offense to SpongeBob the masterpiece btw) to explain what's literally happening on the screen. unfortunately this problem persists throughout the entire series, you're basically having your hand held throughout the entire series when you don't even need it. It feels like having your hand held while trying to navigate your very own living room.
Oh man the characters...
It's pretty rare that I would ever want to describe a character as a ""mary sue"", but when I do I really mean it. Tanjiro, our pure hearted boy of pure kindness, is practically a God at everything he needs to be. he's literally capable of defeating a villian who has devoured countless warriors much stronger and more capable than him, despite the fact he hasn't even fought anyone besides his teacher, who let all of his previous students die to how crap he was, and a sentient rock. And if you ever want to say ""But anime characters are overpowered all the time DUUUDE!"", there's a difference between a character being a prodigy and a character being an overpowered, poorly written mary sue.
I could never talk about this character without mentioning the insanely overpowered sense of smell he has, it's basically just a plot device for Tanjiro to always know what to do...because he can just smell the answer. No I'm not kidding... I really wish I was though There's a scene where he has to pick an ore for his sword, and despite him literally stating that he has no knowledge about ore whatsoever, all he does is sniff once... and the answer becomes clear, and then he grabs one... like what the fu-. I MAY be okay with this if it turned out he had a history of like... mining rocks or something, but no because he has a magical Mary Sue plot device nose.
Or even in fights it's like ""I smell an arrow flying at the back of my head."" You got to admit that's like... pretty fucking over the top lol.
pretty much the entire cast of characters are either A, there for comedic relief, or B, An emo. I'm not expecting every character to be very good anyway honestly, I'm like this when it comes to any media I consume regardless if it's anime or not. but when every character is literally as dry as a Popeyes biscuit, I think that I may actually be justified in me not liking this entire cast. The villains all pretty much boil down to a good guy at the end of the day, which in concept I'm not against, but literally every villian is either a good guy deep down, or just some blood lusted maniac, and it makes me feel like this series genuinely doesn't even have any actual thought behind it. 
(by the way nezuko does not even qualify as an actual character fight me)
When it comes to the soundtrack it honestly really hurts me how actually unbelievably forgettable it was, it literally sounds like the most generic anime sounding music of all time, I feel like I hear the exact same music in like 97.24% of every other anime that exists. I don't know why they decided to take a series that takes place in ole' timey Taisho era japan, and then just put the most generic sounding modern J-Pop soundtrack with it. And the worst part is that it's not even like- actually good J-Pop. Can't you at least get like Utada Hikaru or something?
As far as Demon Slayer goes I think that a 3/10 is pretty generous all things considered.",3,AwokenStroken
38000,"
                As Faulkner once said, the only thing worth writing about is the human heart in conflict with itself. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba does not follow this advice for storytelling.
Ufotable's latest adaption is based on Koyoharu Gotouge's manga. The story follows a young boy, Tanjirou, who retains empathy for the monsters that massacred his family. This deconstruction of the self-righteous hero archetype throws questions at the audience about morality like ""is it right to seek revenge?"" But if you are expecting a Nietzschean treatment of good and evil - or any kind of emotional maturity for that matter - then Demon Slayer is not the
                  show for you. Spoilers ahead. 
The story attempts to subvert the typical shonen cliches in its protagonist. Tanjirou displays a conscience, which is a surprisingly rare quality in an anime protagonist. The problem is the story remains driven by physical rather than psychological obstacles. This absence of internal conflict means Tanjirou's way of thinking is never challenged. Getting stronger to fight the bad guy of the week is the only thing that matters which, of course, ironically reverts the show back to the same generic shonen tropes it tries to escape from by making its protagonist different. In the end, Tanjirou becomes another boring, one-dimensional shonen hero, rather than a morally conflicted, realistic character who must balance his desire for revenge and pacifism.
Everyone loves heroes but they still have to be relatable on some level. Their heroism has to feel earned. No one really cared about Superman until DC writers developed Clark Kent, making him fallible and human. We never get that with Tanjirou. After the prologue, a way to empathise with him might have been to examine the psychological effects of tragedy. Demon Slayer could have been about the theme of forgiveness. But Tanjirou is never in danger of becoming like the monsters he fights, so it doesn't feel meaningful when he chooses not to kill them. There's no catharsis or meaningful moment when he is forced to kill either, it just sort of happens.
There is so much wasted potential here. The premise of a reluctant hero pushed to his mental limits, along with the Taisho-era setting are not utilised. As far as I can tell, the only discernible reason for Nezuko's existence is to cheer Tanjirou on like a cute mascot. I kept waiting for the siblings' relationship to be explored in more than just head pats and chibi-Nezuko moments. Early on, we are introduced to a potentially interesting plot point in her condition. For a moment, the stakes were raised. I wondered what would happen if she loses control?  What kind of guilt would Tanjirou feel in that situation, if mercy to his sister led to the death of innocents? What kind of difficult choices would he have to make? I was emotionally torn by the idea. But then, like everything else in Demon Slayer, Nezuko's problem magically solved itself, preventing the characters from having to make any decision at all. She just goes to sleep for a bit, and now she's a good demon.
Since my problems mainly lie with the story, I guess I wouldn't recommend the manga either. Conclusion: The most overrated show of 2019.",5,gonejellyfishin

                My opinion:
Kimetsu is an anime half there and half here, the story is very weak, some consider it a masterpiece, but the plot is super weak, superficial characters, I can't like that Nezuko man, she's super useless. Cliché story, annoying characters. Now the animation is splendid.
This anime is not a masterpiece.
Synopsis:
Ever since the death of his father, the burden of supporting the family has fallen upon Tanjirou Kamado's shoulders. Though living impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local village to make a little money
                  selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou to take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the existence of flesh-eating demons that lurk in the woods at night.
When he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a horrifying sight—his whole family has been slaughtered. Worse still, the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, Tanjirou swears to avenge his family and stay by his only remaining sibling. Alongside the mysterious group calling themselves the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjirou will do whatever it takes to slay the demons and protect the remnants of his beloved sister's humanity.",5,Marianahadassa12

                Generic, overrated anime that is ranked higher than better shows it does not deserve such high ratings IMO, let's go. 
First, the story is average at best with demons killing humans yet our idiot MC doesn't believe it's true. Also every great story needs a great villain and this has none of that, all cliche big bad demons just because. So many generic moments too when MC does something in the story you expect him to do, so predictable and poorly written you can tell what's gonna happen where's the fun in that. 
The characters are dull and boring as hell to watch it's like
                  watching paint dry with the way Tanjiro our MC interacts with others always like a teacher's pet. The MC trains, gets strong and uses technique never seen before and wins against demons he really shouldn't alone. So believable right. 
Enjoyment - Not even one episode that's completely enjoyable especially the first 5 episodes, every episode I'm checking the watch hoping for it to end. Generic anime  doesn't mean it's bad but this anime is. For example: Hero Academia is actually enjoyable and fun to watch since you're invested in the characters, Demon slayer fails at that spectacularly with stupid jokes and characters that don't matter.
Animation - Great, without it nobody would hold it to such a high level but it's a pity that other great anime with good stories suffer from animation budget yet this 
gets great animation.
Overall -
Animation is great for action scenes being incredibly beautiful but it's all style and no substance as there are other great shounen anime that has both. 
Edit- actually just watched it during my holiday in TV and well, it's not bad even though the tropes and cliches are there it's fine. Maybe I was too harsh before lol definitely had low expectation, but it's fine and enjoyable so far",6,bladerv

                The anime was only good from episode 1-10 with the dark and serious mood with a little touch of thriller (which i loved)... until the following episodes got f****d up. The episodes after that began to be annoying and dragging.
Pros
1. It has good a combination of animation and use of cgi.
2. The art gives ""fresh"" look in the eyes of viewers.
3. Nezuko's character is cute and badass, well done.
Cons
1. It has 2 VERY ANNOYING characters: Zenitsu (noisy, crybaby, have creepy way of liking girls) and Inosuke (crazy, typical hot tempered boy)
2. This anime doesn't know its real target audience because the fight scenes are for
                  matured, but the humor is for 12-year olds. Which makes it very unbearable to watch and inconsistent. (No offense)

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is a difficult anime to review, skipping between highs and lows with such rapidity it's really hard to decide what the true average is. For each incredibly fluidly animated fight and drop-dead gorgeous special move, there's half an hour of irredeemable trash 'humor' and one-dimensional characters forced in your face. Some of the plot hooks sink deep, others go nowhere. Entire episodes are completely wasted time that do nothing to push the plot forward, while others are seat of your pants exciting from start to finish.
In the end, it's a very mediocre shonen with even less depth than most, but far prettier
                  and better animated than most due to Ufotable's obvious influence - obviously amateur writing that fails to keep the initial sense of mystery and beauty intact. The main character initially seems like a departure from tired shonen tropes, but soon reveals himself as the most one-dimensional and unchanging Gary Stu of them all, pulling superpowers out of his ass with no explanation exactly when it's most convenient.
Nezuko starts off interesting - and then is completely forgotten about for most of the anime, offscreen for multiple episodes at a time, usually with minimal or no explanation, and then trotted back in when we need a cute scene or random ass-saving for Tanjiro. Probably the biggest instance of blatantly wasted potential in the anime and the incredibly poor writing sidelining her for long stretches of time so Tanjiro can be the star.
The two secondary characters introduced a fair chunk through are absolute irredeemable trash on a level I'm honestly surprised they even exist - the blonde one's only purpose is to be a gigantic pussy 24/7 while screaming loudly enough to give a headache (but it's ok, sometimes he hits on women as his only character depth) and the other bull-headed dude's only depth is running around trying to kick people's asses and yelling, which to be fair is less annoying than screaming, but only marginally. Neither of them develop in any meaningful way throughout the anime and come off as incredibly shallow and annoying caricatures, and none of the 'humor' involving them is the least bit funny.
In the end, KnY is just another mediocre shonen, with its main saving grace being the phenomenal presentation - it LOOKS gorgeous, and (no spoilers!) a few fights are an absolute joy to watch, but look past the gorgeous visuals and the show as a whole is a rotting corpse uglier than any of the titular demons that need slaying.",6,Eleiryn

                Animation, art and sound in this anime are outstanding.
Same can't be said about story or characters.
Talking about characters:
1) Tanjirou - the main hero - the ultimate case of ""Mary Sue"". Increadibly perfect and boring character: brave, strong, good. Speaks in generic style, easily triggers by any kind of evil (his mind turnes off). Has no real weaknesses (outside from ""being too good"")
   He trains for about two years (almost nothing from his training gots actually shown) and from zero becomes powerfull swordsman. He bravely charges into every battle while knowing nothing about his enemies, magically survives and then always pulls some sort of
                  power trick to win the fight.
2) Zenitsu - secondary hero - wimpy character to the point of absurd. He is constantly afraid of everything, constantly cries about something. Also, he is INCREADIBLY LOUD, shouting different kind of nonsence. Those his traits show up all the time, making Zenitsu increadibly hard character to endure - at least for me.
   He made his moves twice in entire show - and both times he was fighting, while being asleep. Fainted out of fear and then fighted... I can't even add those actions to his account. It's like his body fought, not actually Zenitsu. Sadly, body is not a character
   On an upside: Zenitsu is kind and has weaknesses to overcome. Too bad those weaknesses owerwhelm him entirely 
3) Inosuke - secondary hero - stupid character. Considered to be strong, yet loses to Tanjirou in the direct and simple fight. Generally, does almost nothing usefull in the entire show. Inosuke killed one demon when made his appearance - that's all. Oh, and once he used his technique too find an enemy in the forest. Now that's all.
Inosuke was like worse version of Tanjirou - he always charged into battles because of fighting lust, but actually didn't won in any.
   On an upside: Inosuke was somewhat funny (bacause of his blunt attitude). Brought fun to this otherwise boring show. Yet, even in ""Jester"" role he seems mediocre.
4) Nezuko - can't say too much about her, for the most part of the show she was either sleeping either... standing silently, i guess. Nezuko has almost no personality. All i can say - she was kind and remained kind in this weird state of hers. She supports Tanjirou, yet shows almost no emotion to other characters. Cute. But boring.
Talking about story:
   It is linear and predictable. Also, scenario repeats itself one episode after another: strong demon appears - Tanjirou charges - demon dies. Most of the quests heroes received from talking crows - crow say ""do this and this"" - hero does. Why they trust those crows so easily? How heroes recieve payment? Why everybody has to pass such stupid test in order to become a demon slayer? (i mean, most of contestants die, it is just ridiculous). Too many questions were left without an answer
   The main villain of the show has interesting design, but only on the outside. On the inside - it is generic cruel villain, who tortures his minions for failures. He had a good opportunity to kill the main hero himself - yet he gived this task to his pawns
   All in all, There were way too many holes in logic, story, worldbuilding... Characters were annoying. I couldn't fully enjoy the show, most of the things felt stupid and unreal
   Art and music are great, but they don't justify poor writing.
   I am greatly surprised this show gathers such big scores. Ratings and friend's reccomendation were the reasons for me to watch Demon slayer. I became dissapointed as a result
   Similar shows I actually enjoyed: My hero academia, Assasination classroom. Those are far from being perfect too, yet they had nice characters and more convincing world settings",5,Leenbow

                Demon Slayer is a show about slaying demons. But when the MC, a son of a shrine priest, returns to his home to find his family slaughtered and his sister turned into a demon, what will he do? Join him as he seeks to find a cure for his sister and bring an end to the evil demons that plague society while simultaneously proving to his demon-hunting superiors that his demonic sister is not a threat to them all. Episodes consist of epic, high-stakes, over-the-top fights with top-notch stylistic animations, with episodes of training and character development sprinkled in, making for a great balance.
This anime
                  is by far the most critically acclaimed anime of 2019 and any anime fan worth their salt should give it a shot. It also has normally excellent animations and adds an over-the-top stylistic element to it in order to enunciate the fight scenes. It can feel a bit slow during training episodes after fights, but that's simply because the fights are so good that the rest of the show pales in comparison. 
If you like fights, flowing top-quality animation, or samurai then this is for you! A liking of comedy is also ideal, as there are myriad laughs interspersed as well.
As someone who has read the manga I am looking forward to the future seasons as well and have high hopes for the future of this series.",9,Dr_Civilization

                I'm not sure how to start this but I'll just give my scores, summarise the first episode then explain why I gave the scores that I did.

You can skip the next three paragraphs if you don't want to read the summary.
I'll start off by talking about the story, I won't go into too much detail since I like to keep my reviews short also sorry if anything is a little off, I started Demon Slayer a while ago and only finished it recently.
Basically the first episode starts off with Tanjiro trekking through a forest carrying his younger sister,
                  Nezuko, it then flashes back to before where Tanjiro is about to leave his family and to go to the town, there's some useless dialect between him and his siblings (and his mother I think) he then leaves to town as his family waves him goodbye (he then just has a useless conversation with Nezuko it's not that important), forgot to mention earlier but Tanjiro has a really keen sense of smell. 
I think he goes to town to sell charcoal or something, anyway skip a few hours and he's walking home but he's stopped by a man telling him that the mountain is too dangerous to go up at night, he goes inside to eat dinner and sleep at the strangers house (I refer to him as ""the stranger"" because I can't remember his name)they talk about demons and demon slayers or something I don't really know. The next morning he leaves the mans house to hike up the mountain back to his own house, as I mentioned before he has a strong sense of smell and can smell blood so he immediately starts to run, he makes it back to his home to see that his family has been slaughtered by demons the only survivor being Nezuko, then we're back to where we started, Tanjiro trekking up the mountain carrying his younger sister, we then find out that Nezuko has been turned into a demon.
Him and his sister fall off a mountain or something and are saved by the snow and Nezuko tries kill Tanjiro because why not? Tanjiro shouts some random crap and then Nezuko starts crying and then some guy just comes out of nowhere and tries to kill Nezuko I think, but ends up slicing off Tanjiro's ponytail. That one guy that came out of nowhere grabs Nezuko and is about to decapitate her and Tanjiro begs him not to (I'm getting really lazy now, sorry about this I've been writing for a while) Nezuko doesn't get decapitated, Tanjiro gets knocked out by something, Nezuko defends Tanjiro and then gets hit in the face. Tanjiro wakes up and sees Nezuko lying next to him with a nuzzle in her mouth. He is told to to go up a mountain and find some old man, they dig graves for their family and then go to find previously mentioned old man and then the episode ends.
Anyway that was my lazy summary of the first episode so now I'll just talk about why I scored this show with what I did.
The story: The story is mediocre, it's not bad but it's nothing special either, the concept of slaying demons in anime has already been done, but a show doesn't really have to be original just to be good, it just needs to be well done, but for me it didn't really hit that mark. The writing for the show is average at most, however I am able to see why other people can enjoy it.
Art: Although the artstyle isn't something I'd like personally (which put me off slightly) it is a nice artstyle, it just looks a little rough compared to what I would usually like, I might have actually scored the show lower than I did if it weren't for the animation/ art.
Characters: The characters for me were just bland and annoying which kind of put me off, they are fairly cliche, Tanjiro for example is just your average, kind and caring shounen protagonist, it's not that I want the main character of a show to be a d*** but these types of characters are just too nice so much to the point where it annoys me.
Nezuko doesn't even seem to have a purpose except sitting in a basket and looking cute, the entire show it feels like she's incapable of doing anything herself except relying on Tanjiro, not much else to it, I just dislike characters that don't do anything for themselves.
Zenitsu is just the average pervert that they threw in because why not? Inosuke is just the character that tries to pick fights for no reason, he's an ok character but not the type I like, they kind of remind of Bakugo and Mineta from mha 
Enjoyment: I honestly found myself procrastinating when it came to watching an episode of this, it was just really boring for me, I started Demon Slayer last year and wasn't enjoying it so I asked some people if it starts to pick up and they said to give it 10 episodes, yeah I ended up dropping it, I have finished it now but I was pretty bored and disappointed by the end, not much else to it I just didn't enjoy this show :/
Overall I give it a 3, it's probably one of the most overhyped shows I've watched, it's basically just every shounen trope imaginable, not really much else too say I just didn't enjoy this show, but yeah that concludes what I had to say about Demon Slayer, sorry if I sounded unsure of myself with this review but I don't really remember much so I was kind of nervous about getting something wrong.",3,anxsa0

                all i can say. beautiful but bland. 
I genuinely did not find anything interesting about Tanjiro as the protagonist. The side characters range from hilarious (Inosuke) to legitimately interesting (Nezuko) to downright annoying (Zenitsu). Those are the only saving graces for the characters as I don't remember any others, even the villains. Some have interesting design choices and I give credit for that but damn are they dull.
The animation and art style is the obvious highlight of the show. Its downright breathtaking. Its a shame a really cookie cutter show with a cast of mostly bland characters holds it back from its full potential.

                I really wasn't expecting Demon Slayer to be this childish.
Can't believe this is what everyone's been praising this whole time..it's just forgettable and boring really.
Around episode 10 and especially 11 it was absolutely unwatchable because of how focused the episodes were on that blonde kids exaggerated and so-not-funny fear of literally everything. Someone asked him why he carries a sword if he can't use it and that's exactly what I'm wondering as well. 
I hope he actually proves to be a good character in the future because I can't stand absurd characters like these. I had to take 3 breaks just to finish 1 episode
                  because of this guy. Other than that, the humor is absolutely awful and hasn't made me even smile once.

                Before i even started watching demon slayer i was told that it was incredible and it was an incredible anime eager to check out the hype for it i started watching it and after 15 episodes i have never been so disappointing and board in my entire life an unfortunately its just another generic shonen thats been over hyped and put on a gigantic pedestal for some reason and I'm genuinely  confused as to why people like it so much  
characters 2/10
all of the characters in the show are bland an un-original, theres no substance to their characters apart from look at me
                  i can scream stuff and it will magically make me strong and funny. The main character i cant even remember his name hes that forgettable, his personality is bland and filled with contradictions thats almost laughable and the only time he gets strong in this anime is through screaming random moves he just came up with that magically work which is with him saying something cringey like ""i must save my sister so i will fight"" which is extremely boring and predictable. the other side characters are just annoying and their personalities are all frustratingly bad.
Story 3/10
The story starts off with the main characters family being killed apart from his sister who is still alive but hes motivated to cure her (how interesting) and for some reason he doesn't seem to care much that they are all dead apart from a brief scene were hes sad despite all this he forgets his family is dead and only cares about fixing his sister which is a bit odd but whatever. But the real problem begins as he wants to train to become a demon slayer in order to avenge his family and put an end to this ruthless race that's plaguing his region so he trains with an old man that teaches him how to fight and yes we do see a a fair amount of training hes goes through however  it suddenly decides to jump forwards in the future without giving us any information and hes magically able to cut a stupid rock. after this he gets a contract to kills a few demons he fights them all boring fights that are predictable and nothing original is able to come out the story. I basically forced myself to keep watching and i regret, finally after 15 episodes i just didn't care anymore and stopped watching it.
animation 8/10
as much as i dislike about this anime i do however love the animation and overall art style that this anime has this doesn't automatically make it good though in order for the animation to be impact on me i need to relate and have emotional connection to the context of whats happening which demon slayer does not provide because everything is predictable and the characters are lifeless despite this its very smooth but has wasted potential on this shitty anime.

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is amazing and you should all watch it. That's it, that's the review.
jokes aside, this anime is actually really good and there's a reason why everyone's talking about it. The story is interesting and all the characters are really well written as they drive the story forward smoothly. The animation is breathtaking, not to mention the amazing camera work with each episode- I was really blown away how beautiful this anime is. The same can be said about sound, as the music in this anime is beautiful and is appropriate for each scene.

Demon Slayer is amazing. The art style is beautiful, the character designs are wild and spontaneous and blow my mind from how amazing they look. The concept and design adds a new twist to the genre in general. The voice actors are amazing and very skilled at what they do, and they are carefully selected from an overflowing ocean of voices.

I was reluctant to start it when it first came out, 'oh its just another mindless monster killer show'.
Boy was I wrong.
Everything about this show is spectacular. Its emotional, its lays bare the characters emotions and drive for the audience to take as they will. I am just writing what I think will summarize this show, but in reality its beyond reviews and acceptance, its an icon.

                A very typical, generic, and average anime with pretty bland and very stereotypical, trope-y, one-note characters that happen to have some very beautiful (though not mind-blowing) animation. 
There are some interesting fights with some tact that were definitely enjoyable, but the characters won't shut up because they have to remind you of their singular character trait every second. That's not to say all the characters are bad, just that the main protagonists range from average to bad (although I would say they aren't worse than the average anime, in that the average anime has bad characters). 
The main four characters' personalities can almost entirely be
                  described as: lawful good/goodie two shoes; mute-shy girl (which also almost describes two other characters); cowardly, whiny/annoying, and obsessed with girls; and dumb, angry, loud man who tries to fight everything. 
Weak characters aren't always an issue in anime, however, this one doesn't do a good job of anything that could remedy it or consistently distract you from the issue. However, I don't think that necessarily brings this anime down a lot, it very much depends on your tolerance for this kind of thing. Personally, I didn't mind it too much, aside from one of the main characters, the whiny and annoying one for the very fact that he was whiny and annoying.
The sound design is good but nothing to write home about, but it is none the less good. The OP is pretty decent. 
Overall, I would say this is definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen it and have run out of things to do. It's the kind of thing you would while doing something else, though that would have you not pay as much attention to the animation which is the best part of it, and having to read subtitles would limit the things you could do while watching it.",6,Tech_M

                I will first start out with a quote from a very certain person to describe this anime known as Kimetsu no Yaiba... ""Demon Slayer boils down to just demon of the week"" 
I was hyped for Demon Slayer much like everyone else was, the animation was great, especially in that now famous episode 19, which obviously blew up, but, of course, I don't remember a damn thing about the anime other than the fights, which were obviously the most vocal. The story...if you can even call it that, is completely forgettable, hell, all I remember is just that Tanjiro needs to kill whatever demon turned
                  his sister into a damn demon, I don't remember the name, but regardless.
Story 3 out of 10
As I said, the 'story' is completely forgettable, hardly anything was worth remembering, nor do I remember anything about it...so I can't really explain much of what I dislike, and I do not want to experience it again.
Art 6 out of 10
The art was actually pretty decent, it's not my favorite, but I praise it's unique sense of style, especially in the visual effects, like fire and water.
Sound 8 out of 10
Dear me, besides the fight scenes, this was my favorite part about the anime, the sound is almost perfect in some of the scenes...it's what gave me goose bumps!
Character 3 out of 10
I'm sure if you've seen the anime...you know why the character is this low...because there isn't any!
Enjoyment 7 out of 10
Kimetsu no Yaiba was a adventure to say the least, it's a very okay show, but it's not worth remembering outside of it's fight scenes, which I am sure everyone will remember.

All what company needs is support, no matter the nuances, they will take care of that.
It is the Law of life that, if it gives results, what is good must continue

                Demon Slayer starts off feeling like an ordinary shounen anime. We have the main character wanting to avenge his family's death while also wanting to cure his sister, he is going to do anything it takes to complete this goal. I think the main plot of Demon Slayer is pretty generic and simple, but there is something about this anime that I just think sticks out from other shounen anime.
The animation on this anime is outstanding, every single scene of this anime is beautifully made. The characters have unique styles which makes them more unforgettable and the battles scenes are really enjoying to watch because
                  they are just so incredibly well animated. I also found the sound quality to be extremly good, which also makes the battle scenes more awesome. The soundtrack and background music was also very good.
What I really like about this anime is the characters, and they are also the reason why I think this anime differs from other shounen. The main character has that bravery and determined personality that is common among shounen main characters, but what I like about the main character in Demon Slayer is that he is a very sympethic person and very kind. I also like how he contain his cool during battles instead of being consumed of rage. There is also many other interesting characters that I would love to see more off.
Another thing I really like about Demon Slayer is how they portray the villains in the anime. Almost none of the villains feels completely evil, and you often feel bad for them, which makes them feel more realistic and human.
I thought the first episodes of this anime felt a bit slow and uninteresting. I didn't really feel that invested in the characters, but after the first half of the anime I started to really enjoy watching it. I can't wait for a continuation of this anime and I hope it gets even better.",7,Yakima7

I started it late, after the hype, I had the information that it was pretty normal but episode 19 changes everything. Some even said that deserves anime of the year. After watching it, I was left with a huge feeling of dissapointment, generic shonen, generic setup, the ost: I did not find it suitable for certain situations.
Good:
-the animation, in that aspect ufotable never disappoints
-some characters designs.
-certain ""semi-epic"" moments.
Do I regret watching it? No.
Generic shonen? Mostly yes, it has a few good moments.Forgettable anime? Without a doubt.

The amount of detail, the camera movement, the amount of emotion that each fight trows at you is just wonderful. Is it a masterpiece? No, but it is close to it.
Most of the characters, have interesting backstories, are funny and have their distinct quirks, not your basic and usual shounen characters. 
But what really sets this show apart from other shounen is, of course, Nezuko, the cute and adorable main protagonist sister. I am just
                  joking of course! ^^ The fights are what will make you watch this anime. Every fight is different, being the way the main protagonist wins always different. Also, not all fights end like you might think they will. And when you reach episode 19, you will be treated with one of the best moments ever in anime. Absolutelly AMAZING.
Do me a favor and watch this.",9,Edgar_Tip

                Kimetsu no Yaiba, also known as Demon Slayer is fairly balanced of emotional storytelling, also including cool and funny moments of the main protagonist.
[SPOILERS]
The story revolves around feelings of doing right and giving everyone a second chance. World where the anime sets in all of the ""Demon Slayers"" just slay demons because they are meant to do so, but Tanjiro the main protagonist can see/smell the grief and sorrow of the demons who actually regret and just wanted to be recognized/that regret their choices.
My favourite character is Inosuke, for his ""goofy"" attitude but still genuine. Even though Tanjiro is the ""cool"" guy, his companions still
                  build his character very well.",10,NiQzu

                The bad:
-1 point: first 2 episodes
How does no one know demons exist? Why would you live in the middle of woods if demons exist? Of course you will get devoured.
-1 point: too much time spent on enemies that are gonna die anyways. Cool, you have a sob story, every does. No need to spend multiple episodes talking about it.
-1 point: The scared character was funny when first introduced, but it's boring making the same joke 20+ times in 1 episode.The good
+1 Animation is just gorgeous, the water abilities are beautiful.

+1 The meeting at headquarters was perfect, literally god tier. The author had to study psychology and philosophy for the writing here. Literally the best resolution of conflict I have ever seen in any show.",10,cancerowns

                The Art is very beautiful, also the sound effect is awesome.
But the story, it was a good story, but it's just focus to Tanjirou, Tanjirou friends (like Inosuke, Kanao, Zenitsu), and Hashira, that's make demon corp members with low rank can't help on the Demon Corp vs Twelve Demons Moon.
If the writer manga can make any characters, which it's has same power with Tanjirou,etc, and it'll be helping at fighting, the story will be the outstanding!
I'm very fucking enjoy with Art, Sound, Character, it's make me intense!
Adaptation from Ufotable is very masterpiece!
I can't imagine the art when Tanjirou using Breath of the sun and also
                  i waiting Tanjirou used his original breath (Hinokami Kagura Breath).

                *CONTAINS SPOILERS* (it’s really long sorry) *MANGA SPOILERS TO*
Demon Slayer has to be one of my favorite animes. The characters especially, the music, storyline and overall development is something I really enjoyed. 
First, let’s talk about the characters. The three main characters have interesting background, you just have to read the manga. Tanjiro might seem like that typical “hero” of a story or protagonist but he goes deeper than that. He might be similar to many other protagonists but he had distinct features that set him apart from others. For example, the fact that we know noting/ some things about some feature he has, his
                  earrings/scar for example are still mysteries if you just watched the first season, he might be kind hearted but his motives are not so kind hearted. One of them is revenge but deeper down he also wants to protect what’s dear to him and others, human lives.  Now onto Inosuke, he might seem like an annoying type character  when you first see him, but as the story progressed, Inosuke became more than that, we see his skills in action and that fact that he never backs down from a fight. Inosuke also becomes more kind hearted towards Tanjiro as the story goes on, showing his charcter development, since, in the beginning he disliked him. Finally Zenitsu to be honest, I find his crying and outburst of screaming is funny. I feel like people can relate to Zenitsu as he is a character that most of us would be if we were in this world. Also, the fact that Zenitsu is more powerful when he sleeps is great development, you wouldn’t typically expect for a main character to be scared like that to. Nezuko isn’t a major character in my eyes but she is a good part to the story. The fact that she is always there to help her brother creates this feeling it adds the love they feel for each other (SIBLING LOVE) Nezuko also not eating humans adds development to her character, it shows us that she can fight as a “Demon Slayer” though she is a demon herself. 
(Sorry there’s a lot of character stuff)
The Harshira have some of my favorite characters in the whole entire show. Each of them has a unique design and breathing style. The don’t get enough screen time in the show, but in the manga, you can really see the full extent of there powers. The nine pillars are some of the most amazing people in the show that are labeled side characters. They each have “their own” arcs that is shared. I also wanted to mention them because many reviews I have seen don’t typically mention them since there screen time is low.
Moving on to the battles, I believe that demon slayer has some of the best battles out there. The battles between the Upper and Lower moons especially. For example, during the second season, Uzui Tengen’s battle with the Upper Moon Six had me in the edge of my seat the whole time. The intense ness  of the battle was heart reaching, and the speed was also incredible. 
The battles in DS also can profe that the “good guys” don’t always win every battle. For example, Rengoku and Shinbou both die in the show/manga. There deaths can show that the DS’S don’t always win against the enemies they face. Rengoku’s and Akaza battle was intense as well, it had me on the edge of my seat, I seriously didn’t expect Rengoku to die. They use a lot of shock factor and plot twisters during the battles make you want to keep watching.
Now to the Arcs. I believe that all the arcs are amazing in there own right, my tow favorites would have to be the Entertainment District Arc and the Mountain one with the spider demon family. The fact that the Arcs both incorporated different Hashiras made them even better. They didn’t just include Shinbou or Giyuu but they incorporated Tengen in as well, making the Arcs just that much better. Each arc is unqie  in there own way, they can show the development of each character and the plot line.
Now to the demons + animation. The demons backstory’s makes you feel actually sorry for them. The demons showed in the show can be catogized as major demons and lesser demons. The demons that are major usually last longer and the lesser ones die more quickly and only take about one episode to kill off. I personally think that adding the backstories of the demons that we all used to hate makes you feel sympathy for them to the point where you wish they could have been humans or they could have not eaten people like Nezuko. My personal favorite Demon was Rui and his mother. 
Animation from this show is beyond amazing, the animation is a major part of the show and this especially goes for the second season. The way the fire in the second season is drawn and portrayed  is just amazing, you could almost belive is that the fire was truly real. The animation during any of the battles was amaze and really portrayed the seriousness of each battle. I also liked the water graphics when it came to Giyu’s Water Breathing Technique known as “Dead Calm” I thought that it was fabulous.
The music for each season was amazing as well. The art, official or not was amazing and it really showed the true character designs. For example, demon slayers overall art style is really unique and extremely pretty. The official Covers for each series are detailed, and amazingly pretty. 
I seriously enjoyed this show and I believe everyone should at least watch 10 episodes ti really understand the story line.

                I initially avoided Demon Slayer believing it to be just another shonen battle manga with a protagonist that possessed a heart of gold and an indominable drive to succeeded that we have come to associate with shonen protagonists. However, when I noticed that the studio in charge was the legendary Ufotable I decided to give it a shot. After 22 episodes in I can glad say that I was wrong and that this anime is a gem.
Story
Although the story begins in an unoriginal manner it does serve its purpose well as a means to provide the protagonist with goal worth risking his life for. The
                  story gradually blooms into something beautiful that manages to capture joy, sadness, despair, desperation, and laughter quite brilliantly. The world of Demon Slayer and its people isn't black and white, there is a strong theme of broken happiness and tragedy begetting even more tragedy. Once the story gets going it hooks you into its world and makes you care about the its characters. 
Animation
Knowing that studio Ufotable was in charge I began this anime with high expectations and was not disappointed. In fact they exceded my expectations. Utilizing 2D animation, CGI, and even rotoscoping, Ufotable have show cased the skills of their talented staff members brilliantly.
Sound
With the legendary Yuki Kajiura and Go Shiina at the helm, the OST was simply awe inspring. Furthermore, the sound effects utilized in the show were amazing and served their purpose brilliantly to get you invested into Demon Slayer's world, characters, and battles. Additionally the voice actors of Demon Slayer manage to brilliantly capture the character's emotions. Quite frankly I cant find anything wrong with the sound design even if I try its just that good.
Characters
Even with its jaw dropping animation, brilliant sound, and talented voice actors (Japenese), I would have dropped the show early on if I thought the protagonist was nothing special. However, I can safely say that the protagonist, Tanjiro Komado, is a joy to watch on screen. His commpasionate nature really shines through in a manner that really made me feel like he was a genuinally likeable person. Shonen protagonists in general are usually presented as immensely kind and lovable idiots; however, Tanjiro is special. Special in that his kindness shines through and feels genuine in a manner that other series just have not been able to capture, at least for me. All the other characters are great as well and bounce brilliantly off of Tanjiro's personality. In summary, the characters in Demon Slayer are endearing and likeable. 
In all my years watching anime and reading manga this show has managed to strike a chord with me that only very few shows have. If you are still unsure whether to watch this show or not, I say give the protagonist a chance to win your heart. I can't promise that he will be able to but I won't be suprised if he does.",10,Rhetorical_Locus

                Hora hora hora horaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I've just finish watching this anime called ""Kimetsu no Yaiba"", know every once in a while something like this comes up and gives something to look forward to, never mind if it was the usual good vs evil kinda thing where humans fight demons. But, in this anime the line where there was a hidden battle between humans and demon wasn't a clear cut thing for once we have a hero who still thinks that somethings just need to be given a second thought like not all demons were bad, that there may be a way to have sister become human again
                  and that them demons were more in danger with their own kind than with them humans and yet they hunt them and kill them like livestock. Another thing about this anime was it's genre, where it was label as Action, Demons, Historical, Shounen and Supernatural were it was all well played. So, how do I rate this anime????? Here's how:
Story-Good 7: It's genre Action, Demons, Historical, Shounen and Supernatural were well played in this anime's story plot, Action were we see our protagonist do battle with them demons, Demons, cu'z they're the antagonist around here, though Tanjiro did met 2 whom were on the side of good, Historical, cu'z it was the setting where Japan was in the state of embracing modernity and Shounen cu'z them guys were the protagonist around here.
Art-Decent 4: Decent in the sense, that one won't be seeing any Nezuko, Shinbou and Kanao's fanservices around here. Only with closes to risque one can find here was with Mitsuri.
Sound- Very Good 8: That's for the opening theme, Inosuke's loud mouth, and Zenitsu's nervous wreak tone.
Character- Good 7: Ok so we have Tanjiro whose life was turned upside down when he saw his family been massacred, and only Nezuko was the only one who survive , but things turn to worse when she tuned into a demon herself, but the good thing was that she was still able to restrain herself from taking a bite outta Tanjiro, we have Tanjiro who just can accept the fact that his sister has turned into a demon where he can't find it in his heart to kill her, now it's good but IMAO, I just felt piss about it. We have Inosuke who was this all gung-oh slayer who just go all out without even planing ahead, we have Zenitsu who was more useful asleep than awake and I do mean what I mean, cu'z he's more capable fighting in a sleepwalking mode, when he's awake he was more like a pussy whose mode of defense was running away, now with such characters, ok so for the most part they're awesome, but there was just some flaws that I can't shake it off.
Enjoyment-  Good 7: It was enjoyable to a certain point, but as the anime was in it;s final leg about 4 episode more to it's ending, it almost feels like that everything was just about them characters doing a lotta shenanigan on their road to recovery, when those last 2 episode would have been useful if they were send to kill that demon that has Muzan's blood in the train scene.
Overall -Good 7: Well it was good enough to be enjoyed, though I kinda hate it that this has to end as a cliffhanger to simply just make us the audience wait for the sequel which was according to the news a sequel where it is a single episode movie.",7,JiangHaoyi1979

                This anime was so popular that there is not much to add. The story is nothing too groundbreaking and the show is your typical shonen (even tho it has a big difference to many in that family is the main focus rather than the protagonist having a love interest or wanting to be strong for no important reason).
That said, even not having a really original base they did everything DAMN right. I have been disappointed about anime in general since HxH 2011 finished airing and Demon Slayer (honorable mention to Vinlqnd which I think is as good if not better) gave me some faith that
                  there are still mangakas/anime studios trying to do some good shit.
Now I will for sure be there for new movies or seasons of this show. Fucking love it",9,azhra_10

                Kimetsu no Yaiba features pretty art and an interesting setting, but that's about it. 
The main characters feel lifeless and shallow. They have no dreams, and their interactions are awkward at best. Imagine a group of weird-but-uninteresting people who don't really like each other but who are forced to work together as a team. That's the dynamic you can expect from the characters in Demon Slayer.
The side characters are even worse. Many of them don't seem real at all. I don't think the author cared about them, as zero effort seems to have been put into developing their thought processes, value systems or worldviews. They
                  come off as if they're playing a role; everything about them seems artificial.
The comedy feels cartoony. If you find characters slipping on banana peels funny, I believe you might enjoy the humor in this show. 
The story feels uninspired. It's a repetition of 1) the party meets a new oni and decides to defeat it because it's evil 2) the oni turns out to be strong 3) the party defeats the oni with 30% strategy + 70% deus ex machina 4) as the oni is about to die, we see a flashback of its tragic (very cliche) lifestory 5) we learn a bit more about the main villain / a possible cure for the sister 6) rinse and repeat.
The main villain (or what seems to be the main villain) is powerful, but not very intimidating, interesting or badass in any way or form. The same applies to minor villains. This was a letdown for me, as I really enjoy deep, well-written villains, often more so than well-written heroes. For reference, I personally like the central antagonists in FSN (the 2004 game version) Ace of the Diamond, One Piece, Code Geass, the Trails games, Metal Gear games, etc.
The music is good, but I really think the studio should hire a new sound director. Every now and then his choice of BGM doesn't seem to fit the mood at all (e.g. he might have an epic, beautiful track play during a very mundane scene), which felt mildly distracting.
Conclusion: the anime has some minimal entertainment value if you're willing to ignore its faults. I doubt I'll watch the sequel.

                *THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!*
I tried to see why people like this show. I really did. The only thing I could see was the animation carrying the entire show. The storytelling is poor, the bad written characters far outweigh the good ones and the comedy is bad.
I have several issues with how the storytelling is presented to us. The animation really has make the impact of the events that are happening. We were given nothing outside of 'the Kamado family was a happy family' before they were murdered by demons. It was here again the animation that carried the emotional impact of the death of everyone
                  outside of Tanjiro and Nezuko. The reason it worked with shows like Violet Evergarden and Attack on Titan, which also had important characters killed and also have very good animation, was that those anime spent a decent amount of time to characterize those characters and give the audience a chance to bond with them. There was no animation involved in either of those shows.
We all know how well animated the climax of episode 19 was, right? This new breathing technique was achieved because Tanjiro was searching through his memories of his family. Didn't even further characterize his family, just for the breathing. Did he get any lessons on how to do the new breathing technique? Nope, he apparently can just do it, no questions asked. But even if we ignore that, his new breathing technique didn't even pay off. The entire fight against Rui wasn't just about Tanjiro having to beat a lower 5 demon moon, one of the most powerful demons in existence, but it was also an ideological battle about the meaning of family. Really deep, right? Makes the climax of episode 19 even more satisfying, right? PLOT TWIST: Tanjiro never killed Rui, he just decapitated himself and now Tanjiro had to be saved by Giyu, who kills Rui himself. It looked really nice too, but it would have been more satisfying if Tanjiro defeated Rui himself. I get that this fight also represents the steaks for future fights against demon moons, but if that justifies those storytelling flaws, that's going to be a problem.
Then there are the characters, which are most of the time just badly written. Sure, Tanjiro is not your typical dense shonen MC amd has actual depth to him, desiring to give the demons a peaceful end as he knows they were originally human. The other characters however, don't get that treatment. Several of them are even written so they can't get interesting character arcs. Prime examples being Nezuko and Zenitsu. 
Nezuko is turned into a bloodthirsty demon and to keep her alive, Tanjiro needs to prove she means no harm to humans. How do they handle this? Do they give her a side story during the first training arc in which she has to actively overcome her demon desires? Nope, Urokodaki just hypnotizes her into believing himans are good, demons are bad. It would definitely be more interesting to see her constantly have to fight this desire to eat humans, even when confronted against the Hashira. But with the hypnosis, they just remove the need for her character arc to be any interesting. 
Zenitsu is written to be your box standard simp and a complete coward towards demons. How does the writing handle this? Does Zenitsu get forced to overcome his fear of demons? Does he lose his status as a Demon Slayer, causing him to question himself and eventually find new ways to be useful, despite of his fear against demons? Nope, he gets plot armored by a sleeping ninja that's apparently so overpowered, even a powerful spider demon and his loads of minions don't stand a chance against him. If you ask me, having to overcome your dependency on a sleeping ninja sounds a lot less interesting than overcoming your fear of demons.
The comedy in Demon Slayer also falls flat and is really based on either the visuals getting cartoony, or Inosuke being the uncultured swine he is. I really can't think of anything else that can even remotely considered to be funny.
Overall, Demon Slayer looks pretty good, but it's really the animation that carries the show.",3,JWolf2000

                Demon slayer is a great anime. The storyline is decent and wholesome where a young boy does everything he can to protect his cute little sister and to avenge his family who got killed. The art is impossible to describe in words and the music in demon slayer is the best !!! The voice actors are amazing and are perfect for the characters. Some characters in demon slayer are very well- written, like Rengoku-San, Tomioka, Muichiro, Sanemi, Yorrichi, Mitsuri, Shinobu, Inosuke, and specially Tanjiro. The best thing about this anime is that the demons were once humans, just like me, just like you!! And the
                  protagonist can understand their feelings as his sister has also been turned into a demon. He has to fight in order to protect her, in order to save her humanity, he is the best brother. And even after turning into a demon, Nezuko protects humans rather than devouring them. She doesn't forget her brother that shows that how deep their bond is. She sees all humans as her family and survives without blood, that's called humanity. And Tanjiro is the most humane protagonist I have ever seen. I really enjoyed the series so much that I watched it 3 times and I can't wait for the next season. OVERALL - I give it a straight 10/10, it's not overrated, its just beautiful...
I love how this shows the strong bond between a family rather than some typical romance.
And yes, Nezuko chan is hella adorable.....",10,Niharika_chan_14
38000,"
                I've never written a review before but after watching this show I simply had to write about it somewhere.
To put it simply: you will enjoy Demon slayer if you're only looking for pretty art, good animation and great fight scenes. If you want a good story and characters you shouldn't watch this.
After seeing how hyped up the show got I had to watch it. Do I feel like my time watching it was wasted? No. But I also feel like I could've spent it watching something a lot better.
I won't talk about the art and animation because I think it's pretty clear both are fantastic.
                  I am going to criticize everything I had a problem with:
1. Characters
The shows biggest flaw are it's characters.  The character designs are great but that's where the good things end. They are simply flat,boring and could be described with a word or two. Tanjiro has to be one of the worst protagonists I've ever seen. He is literally too perfect. He is cares deeply for his family, he's intelligent, has empathy for everyone(even murderous demons), he's hardworking,etc. The problem is that he doesn't posses a single flaw. When it comes to other characters they aren't any better. Zenitsu is annoying and his screaming and constant crying are supposed to be funny but only a small child could possibly laugh at his antics. I refuse to acknowledge Nezuko as a character at all because she has no personality and is only there to be cute and to save Tanjiro whenever it's convenient for the plot. Inosuke is probably my favorite out of the main four. He isn't great but I found him at least a little bit entertaining compared to the others. When it comes to the main villain of the story, he is very basic. The whole show is treating it's characters like black and white. (in the sense that a character is either purely good or purely bad). The characters either have flaws or positive traits, having both simply isn't allowed. The other characters in the show, besides their visual design, are really forgettable.
2.Story
It's pretty basic and honestly that isn't a problem. I, and I'm sure a lot of people, can get down with a basic story. A lot of times it feels nostalgic watching a show with a familiar type of plot. However, because Demon slayer lacks in characters there is nothing to carry the plot well.
3.Humor
I don't even know if it can even be called that. The jokes are,again,something a child would laugh at. If a show has a 17+ label on it, it shouldn't be there only because of blood/gore/explicit content,it should also be there because you're assuming adults will watch this. So why aren't you treating your audience like adults? Both the characters personalities and humor is something that could easily be put in a children's show and that's a problem.
4.World building
Non existent. At the start of the show you probably believed that this anime took place in an era/world where currently there aren't any/many big advancements in terms of transport or modern devices. However this isn't true because there are literal big cities,trains,etc. shown later on. The problem is that we never got a proper sense of what time period this was supposed to be going on. Another problem is that somehow people who live in cities and the police are unaware of the existence of demons or refuse to acknowledge them. I don't know who thought that that sort of explanation makes any sense, because it doesn't. We know that there are demons who live in cities and honestly since demons represent such a huge threat in this world you can't possibly make me believe that none of those city folk know about them and that the police just blatantly ignores them. It's honestly ridiculous and it's a poor excuse for the reason demons weren't destroyed by now(or the majority of them).
I think that should be all. Aside from these 4 main points there are other things I have issues with such as the existence of a lot of smaller inconsistencies or plot conveniences but I won't get into them due to spoilers. In the end, if you find enjoyment in this show that's great, I found some enjoyment in it as well. However I had to acknowledge all of my issues with it. That's all.",6,zbunj

                **THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**
In the past when anime fans used to have standards, Kimetsu No Yaiba would have never gotten as popular as it did. Every season there’s always an anime that’s visually pleasing that fans really seem to enjoy whether well written or not. Unfortunately, Demon Slayer is heavily praised for the sole reason that is its animation and soundtrack. None of its other aspects are even talked about by its fans because- well there’s nothing to praise. 
Story: 1
The story starts out very strong, which only adds to the disappointment. A boy comes back to his house only to find his entire family
                  killed by a demon. This has rarely been done before, and if presented well, it might have actually been interesting. We get to see Tanjiro’s family for about 3 minutes total and when they die and his sister turned into a demon we’re supposed to care? No we aren’t, because there wasn’t any build up that could have possibly made the scene as intense as it was portrayed to be. The story resets every 5 episodes with a very similar premise “kill the demon with a different attack”. It’s like watching Scooby Doo where every episode (or arc in this case) is continuously repeated with minor changes. Not to mention the way it is presented is far from perfect, or even good. Some parts of the story are dragged out (Rui), some are too short (Swamp demon). They rarely manage to make parts of the story interesting, and when they do, they completely ruin it with a horrible fight that contains no strategy whatsoever. The training and exam arc are so indescribably bad. The exam lasts for 2 episodes and only has one fight scene that was won with the power of friendship and determination. The training arc was the most cliché shonen arc ever. A hinted message that the trainer told their student, and achieving something (slicing the boulder) for the test to be over. 
Art: 10 
Studio Ufotable always manages to bring out some of the highest quality of animation. This is really the only thing going for Demon Slayer and the sole reason it even got this far. The animation is very fluid, it’s very hard to spot a badly animated frame. The fights are very well animated as well. Even when a room is constantly rotating, none of the same shots are reused. The character designs are astonishing, they’re very colourful and there’s a lot of emphasis on facial expressions. The hair and clothing is very well detailed, not to mention the bright, stunning eyes. CGI is almost never used; most of the fight are very fast and use a variety of different angles, yet it isn’t used. 
Sound: 4
As a musician, saying that I am insulted at this series’ soundtrack is an understatement. I believe that what makes an anime’s soundtrack good is how well it fits the story’s atmosphere. Now Demon Slayer, greatly fails at doing that. The soundtrack sounds very modern, it doesn’t sound like samurai fighting demons, it doesn’t sound like serious battle music, it just sounds very insipid. Sure, the music is catchy, and for an average watcher probably sounds very good and fitting. But would you want to watch a western movie with K pop playing in the background. “Tanjiro No Uta” (the soundtrack played in episode 19 during the fight) especially fails at incorporating the show’s theme into the music. It starts off with a piano in a minor key, which is already a problem for a fight that’s supposed to be action-packed and intense. As it continues, it transitions to a female vocalist singing, accompanied by an orchestra in the background. This never will fit Demon Slayer’s fights because it’s very bland. It lacks emotions and it doesn’t draw you into the scene because it doesn’t fit the anime’s theme. When you think of fighting demons, you probably imagine intense or loud music, not a slow-paced, sad cadenza that suddenly becomes louder, but still remains slow. This is done numerous times throughout Kimetsu No Yaiba and it’s intolerable. 
Character: 1 
Here we go, the weakest aspect of Demon slayer: its characters. Every character has one personality trait and no development whatsoever. Inosuke’s only personality is being overly aggressive. And Zenitsu’s only personality is being a cowardly pervert. The characters are not interesting, nor are they funny. Nezuko is the most annoying character in the entire series, she doesn’t have a backstory or any development throughout the show, so it’s very hard to care when she’s about to get hurt. The main character is the most typical shonen protagonist that has every cliché I can name. A good-hearted kid fighting to save other people. The demons have no personality or motive whatsoever. The only actual interesting demon (Rui) who’s motive is to have a family like humans do, was presented so badly, the creator had to find a way to write him out. The main villain Muzan, only has one scene that I could never take seriously because he didn’t get a proper introduction. Giyuu, who doesn’t have a single personality trait besides being serious all the time, only properly appears once in the entire show and then for some reason, the creator thought it would be a good idea that he kills the demon they spent about 5 episodes building up. With no strategy or anything close to that whatsoever, he calmly approaches Rui and slices his head off.
Enjoyment: 1
Boring and cliché story. Nothing interesting besides animation which is the least important aspect after sound. Same fighting constantly repeated with no strategy, characters don’t have a personality. Rushed arcs, rushed fight scenes, no backstory to the characters and the soundtrack is insulting. You might be able to enjoy this if you don’t care about storytelling and just want mindless action which in any case, most other shows do better at that.
Overall: 3
A lot of people think this anime is a masterpiece and to be fair, you probably will too. Frankly, I feel bad for the people who actually thinks it’s well written and has good characters. Did anyone actually talk about this series before the anime came out? No, absolutely not. It’s carried by animation and fan service for action-thirsty fans.",3,MangaSex

                Story: I really enjoy the story, and it is well done. While there are times when a demon dies, and it seems like they all have a sad backstory, that's what I find myself not being mad at that. Tanjirou is sympathetic, he knows the demons committed many crimes, but acknowledges that they were once human too. 
Art: Okay, THIS is where this anime excels!! The art is STUNNING!! Anyone who watches this anime has to agree. The fight scenes are such a sight for sore eyes. As a manga reader, it's so amazing seeing the pages come to life, and honestly the anime out
                  does itself in comparison to the manga. I also love how they keep the silly faces the characters make in the manga, in the anime. It keeps it lighthearted, and it's also one of the things I enjoyed from the manga. 
Sound: Wow, hearing water and the slash of swords all at once??? The breath from Zenitsu before striking??? Amazing!! Such asmr. I am here for it.
Character: All the main characters are very likable in my opinion, I love them all. They each have their own personality and backstory. There's nothing like the top three, Tanjirou, Inosuke, and Zenitsu. Watching this, you will find yourself supporting them and laughing at their silly moments!! Nezuko too, of course the best little sister who fights for humans, even though she is a demon. 
Enjoyment: I really enjoyed watching this, there is only a few episodes left, so I'm looking forward to future seasons. I know the story only gets better from here, so, yes, 100% enjoyment!",10,dweeb02

                The following review contains spoilers... 
Kimetsu no Yaiba was probably the most hyped anime of 2019 and people loved it to the extent that they were able to call it THE ANIME OF THE DECADE.After listening to all the good things about the anime I decided to give it a shot and tbh I expected alot from the anime after listening to all the praise it gets but after watching it all I felt was disappointment...Maybe the anime was not for me but even if it isnt there are some issues with the anime...
Story:
The story is very generic and revolves around a boy named Tanjiro
                  whose family gets brutally murdered by demons and her sister somehow gets turned into a demon so Tanjiro start his journey to become a demon slayer to take in order to avenge his family and also find a way to turn his sister back into a human.There were many things that were questionable regarding the plot and there were some events that were completely illogical like Tanjiro not fighting Muzan even though he was close to him and after the encounter and the fight with Temari and Arrow demon he just continues on his path instead of finding Muzan.I know its too early for them to fight but why did the writer make them cross paths?For Tanjiro to not fight Muzan was completely illogical for his personality.
The anime also skips the entire training arc and only shows glimpses of Tanjiro climbing down a mountain and doesnt even show the events that took place when Tanjiro tried to learn breathing techniques.
Apart from that Orokudaki,the man who trains Tanjiro points out that he has hypnotized Nezuko to think of demons as enemies and humans as friends...Why did he not do this with other demons?
Moreover why is the demon slayer core not recognized by the government?I mean no one in the world would be safe until each village has at least one demon slayer responsible for its protection.
The show also introduces main characters very late and this gives rise to the question that why couldnt they form an alliance to fight demons instead of going solo.Wouldnt it have been better that way?
And in ep 19 how does Tanjiro out of nowhere changes breathing styles and from water breathing instantly shifts to fire breathing?
The comedy of the show is also very forced and ruins serious moments and is very annoying at times.
These are just some of the questions that are left unanswered by the anime and the transaction from one arc to the other was terrible as it was just Tanjiro's crow pointing out a demon.Tanjioro then follows the directions and kills the demon...thats the summary of the entire show...
Animation:
As much as I am not a big fan of the story I really like the animation quality.The animation when Tanjiro uses breathing forms is a feast to the eye.I think Ufotable did a marvelous job with the animation of the show and I think that was the main reason for the show to get alot of hype and high ratings.I really have no issue with Ufotable as they brilliantly animated a mediocre story and made the show look beautiful.But just imagine the show without Ufotable.It would be lifeless and because of the mediocre story and annoying characters people wont like it at all.
Characters:
The main issue I had while watching the anime was being annoyed by the immensely annoying cast of the show.
Tanjiro:
I have no issue with the mc but he is nothing special and he does not develop much throughout the show.He pretty much remains the same guy the 26 episodes of the anime.He is a typical nice guy and his personality isnt complex so he is an average mc imo.He is nothing special but he is better than most of the characters of the show.
Nezuko:
Nezuko is cute and she remains quiet throughout the show wso there isnt much to say about her.She is a cutie and isnt annoying so she was one of the bearable characters of the show.
Zenitsu:
The most annoying character was Zenitsu.He had the post pathetic back story and cried like a baby throughout the entire show and he becoming a badass after falling asleep was a completely illogical phenomenon.The show would have been way better without him imo.
Inosuke:
Inosuke is another annoying character and he is always acting abnormal.All we know about his back story is that his mother left him in a forest and how he grew up is a mystery.
Apart from these all the other characters were either mediocre or typical and even the villain Muzan was stupid and killed many characters for no particular reason.The only character I liked was Rui an tbh I thought the demons were better characters than the main cast.
I wont say that the show is bad as some of you might love it for its animation and fight scenes but when it comes to writing this show is mediocre.It was just not for me because I am a person who is more interested in well written,complex anime with well written and well developed character.Personally I wasnt able to enjoy the anime but that does not mean that its bad.It justt depends on what type of viewer you are.

                Over the many years I have been an anime fan, shounen is by far one of my most consumed genres. I have vivid memories from my childhood of rushing home to catch Naruto on toonami and of how I was affixed to the bed whenever they would show day long marathons of the show.
I remember my awe when 7th grade me witnessed the violence and gore of bleach and how I binged the first 3 seasons. To this very day, I keep up with one piece and choose specific points during the year to catch up with the series. I hold a series like yu
                  yu hakusho to be one of the best anime out there and I continue to watch current shounen like my hero academia, 7 deadly sins, attack on titan, etc.
Shounen is not a very difficult genre to pull off. The writers know who their target audience is, young males, and what they want (fights, fights, and more fights). They want a protagonist to root for, a villain to hate, a supporting cast to also love, moments of comedy, and even sometimes a hinted romantic aspect that will never be explored. These are what keeps fans of the genre coming back to show after show as long as they meet these elements. The fact is that the genre doesn’t really need to change much to get people to watch it.
Demon slayer has a majority of these factors. However, there are some aspects of this anime that do differentiate it from other shounens slightly. For one, the characters in the show are written in ways that characters aren’t normally written in the genre. The protagonist of the anime: Tanjirou isn’t blinded by rage or devotion to some lofty goal. He merely loves his sister and wants to cure her. In addition, he isn’t driven by rage or hatred toward demons. He kills them, but he does it in order to free them from the burden they have been placed under by the villain of the anime Kibutsuji.
Demons slayer’s main antagonists: the demons, are monsters. However, they are monsters that the anime tends to portray as tragic figures. During many points during the show, we see the past lives of demons that are defeated and we see that many of them have tragic pasts which led them to become demons. They have emotions and fears. In addition, they themselves are simply acting under Kibutsuji.  Tanjirou understands this fact. Since his own sister Nezuko is a demon and he cares for her, he doesn’t simply view the world he is part of in black and white. He sees demons as victims and he kills them partly to free them from the burden of having to murder humans simply to survive. 
Kibutsuji is a truly great villain. I feel his influence over every aspect of demon slayer’s world. He is cold, calculating, and sadistic. He has absolute power and it corrupts it absolutely. I did find it a little cliché that he is the demon that kills Tanjirou’s family which leads to Nezuko becoming a demon. He is the world’s top demon. It almost seems baffling he would simply just murder a random family when he likely could have demons bring him victims. However, that is a minor qualm with the show’s writing. I appreciated how the anime immediately conveys his incredible strength and cunning among first witnessing him on screen. Immediately, I was able to understand that the path to defeating this figure would be long lasting and difficult for Tanjirou and the other characters.
Tanjirou’s sister Nezuko is also a character of considerable depth despite the fact that she has no dialogue. Tanijrou and her have a true sibling relationship that isn’t incestual, which tends to be rare in some anime. She is a great fighter and her interactions with tanjirou in the anime are worth watching. She acts as Tanjirou’s core motivation for why he kills demons. In addition, there are moments where she resists her own demonic urges which showcase the anime’s key moments of tension and show off her character in unique ways that can’t normally be conveyed since she doesn’t have dialogue. 
Though there are some characters that are annoying at first, I even grew to love them. At first, I thought Zenitsu was a whiny, thirsty, annoying character. However, he had moments of considerable growth and I even got to witness moments where he got to shine  as greatly as Tanjirou. Innosuke is a standard pig-headed fight-obsess moron, but he adds a lot of charm to the anime and I loved watching someone just go all in during fights like he did.  
The animation in demon slayer is top notch. Everything just looks pristine and detailed. The fights catch the eye immediately and every frame moves with fluidity and style. Demon slayer works well based off its simplicity and how it utilizes every episode. Episode to episode something significant happens and we get to see characters develop in some respect. I also appreciate that this isn’t the type of anime where the key to winning fights in simply overpowering the enemy. 
The demon slayers themselves, while tough, aren’t god level protagonists like goku or Naruto. They are simply swordsmen who know best how to utilize their weapons. In addition, the demons are enemies that require tact and strategy. Each fight requires characters to figure out who they are fighting, what their abilities are, and how to best utilize their own abilities in order to defeat them. This is what kept me invested in the fights episode to episode. 
Overall, this anime kept me invested episode to episode with its fantastic art, fights, characters, etc. I always had a reason to keep watching because everything remained consistent episode to episode. Fights got more complex, and the world continually gets expanded. Demon slayer doesn’t revolutionize the shounen genre, but it provides a different enough take on its characters that makes it a refreshing watch. If you are a fan of shounen, you might already know you want to watch it. However, what makes demon slayer a truly great show is the fact that it gives you what you mainly want to watch in addition to providing you with additional aspects which draw you in.",8,weabooslayer69er

                As a series, kimetsu no yaiba is fantastic. Early on, episodes can be quite a drag. They're not necessarily bad but arent to enjoyable or engaging. The story sets up as a cookie cutter shonen series with a neat sense of atmosphere and flashy animation but as i went on i couldnt help but get engaged with the world and adore the characters which i first saw as grating and irritating.  
Alongside this, ufotable brings orgasmic animation and sound design throughout ,especially in the famed episode 19, being quite the astounding piece. And past this point for me, i would say the comedy is
                  much more consistent and the characters more engaging overall. 
After watching the series i immediately had to read the manga. And after seeing this astounding adaptation and being forced to give a 10 to one of the series' more lackluster arcs, i cant wait to see more",10,Aspen_log

                This is godlike. Story is average so far....
I enjoy the characters especially Tanjiro...
Character design is amazing IMO
Best animation out of any anime I have ever seen.
Best Anime of 2019 hands down....
Best Main Protagonist hand down...
Best Girl Nezuko.....
Also...There are certain moments in this anime that just straight up made me nut. Especially the fight sequences. UFO Table really knows how to use the sound and visual design to create a true masterpiece. 
Even if the story falls behind, the amazing spine tingling moments make up for it.
Also...
From what I heard from manga people is that the story gets better so we never know!?",10,bnnnanaice

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is the perfect example of ""JUDGING PEOPLE BY APPEARANCE"".It also fits in the example of a foolish act of exchanging gold for bronze. 
When the anime was released in 2019 , no one even noticed it despite having such an outstanding animation. Thanks to a very toxic place called TWITTER which hyped it's episode 19.
Story:3
Now let us talk about the story, this could have been a pretty decent storyline, but looks like author has made a huge blunder in story presentation by revealing the main antagonist in very few episodes.You have seen many shows, where the antagonists make their appearance in the
                  climax of arc or during final few episodes. I appreciate author for trying something new but in SHOUNEN stories, that won't work.
Art:10
AMAZING, SUUUPER , GOLD and the credit and money shall only go to UFOTABLE.
Sound:9
Again, super,amazing. It is one of those animes which benefited from a good opening songs like NORAGAMI ,TOKYO GHOUL. The director of episodes deserves a major credit for choosing such epic OSTs.
Character:4
Poor,super disgraceful. A crybaby protagonist , a loud mouth simp who gets serious sometimes and a good boar. At first trying to show that MC has trained a lot but still failed,tries harder and then give him a super power because of few tears he shed for his sister. No proper power division.Concept of HASHIRA is fine , we see that in every shounens. Any way talking about the form of superpowers, they are just for the sake of visuals. I understand that author wanted some sort of HAMON thing , breathe and get power but in this show it is so absurd.But it definitely helped for visuals so credit for that.
Enjoyment:6
Only during fight scenes, that's it. Though there are some sad scenes but don’t hit you much.Though you remain stunned by the visuals, there are other factors that lack here.You are not watching a superhero movie from MARVEL as a child that you will only love visuals and be happy. The demon backstories are like- I was a human,sad, unhappy and now I am a demon.I think it lacks a bit depth.If the author could have fixed this, demons could have been amazing, but they are just henchmen and they do not need back stories.But sadly, the anime wants you to take these backstories as an important part of storyline, gives quite good screen time to grab your attention but you know , I just don’t feel that.
Overall:5
There was a saying ""Only those who knows, has seen the BEST can judge.That’s why you are evaluated by a professor in schools, universities.Not by a student.That’s why you are judged by a coach, not your teammates.
.Same goes to this anime.
As for one who have just started watching animes like Naruto, MHA find it super good.Many webs might love it for visuals, but as for me , who watches Japanese anime for powerful storytellings it is disappointing 
As seen many good shounen animes, old generation animes,I don’t find this anime intriguing(actually I find concept of MAL useless because it brainwashes people.You find a show good, find bad comments about it, now you don’t feel the same.You feel a show is bad , find good comments about it , you start thinking it was a good show despite you really not feeling that.So it is completely your opinion about any shows, I just wanted some attention so I wrote my feelings about this show, but this is completely your choice whether to like a show or dislike it.Actually reviews in Mal shall be stopped right? It completely changes your opinion regarding a show, and that’s bad.)
Just getting amazed at some animations and neglecting how badly the story had been presented.I don't mind it being a generic shounen. Judge an anime by it's story, we just need smooth animations, that's it.

                This, this right here is amazing.

The story could have been better, but it was very entertaining to watch.
The art style is something I've never seen before, and that's a part of why i love KNY so much.
This is one of the rare shows in witch i like the main character.
Tanjiro is a great example on what a shounen protagonist should be.
My only complaint is Inouske, I just don't like him and he honestly just ruins the atmosphere in any situation.
All in all, would recommend this masterpiece.",10,bbmitsuri

                I usually understand the hype around seasonal anime, but this one really stumps me. Have legions of people never seen another shounen before? Are people just watching the OP and then skipping to the water scenes? Do people actually find Zenitsu's non-stop screaming funny? These are all questions I had to grapple with while watching probably the most disappointing series in all of 2019.
Story - It's a fairly standard 'kill the bad guy who killed my family' story, with a bit of Tokyo Ghoul tossed in. It hits several common shounen tropes and executes on them somewhat-competently, I guess: a training arc, an exam, another
                  training arc. Not only is the story mildly interesting at best, but the serious moments are regularly undercut with jarring and awkward ""comedy"" bits or exchanges. The atmosphere of the show is regularly undercut by a bizarre compulsion to insert silly character reactions, goofy voice acting, or a cliche gag. 
Art - The art for this series is very polished, and the animation for the fights is top-notch. The character's main attack style has a unique aesthetic for anime. The actual character designs and art style is on the standard side but is distinctive enough to stand out. The look of this show is definitely one of it's saving graces.
Sound - I'll say it now - the Adult Swim 30 second edit of this OP is all you need; there's almost nothing substantial in the other 60 seconds. That 30 seconds is an absolute banger, though. In general, the OST for this series is great, and it likely set the tone better than the writing ever could.
Characters - Make it stop. When I was forcing myself through this show, I would've paid money for a version of these episodes with Zenitsu's constant shrieking cut out. Did the producers actually find this funny? I don't know if I've ever encountered a more actively irritating character in my time watching anime. Most of the other characters are just bland. The MC has almost no personality and basically serves as a vessel to drive the story. The other characters are embodied entirely by the first sentence of their character trope on TV Tropes; nothing else that's memorable or even remotely interesting at all. Even the villain falls flat at first, because the series has no idea how to introduce him correctly.
Enjoyment - There were maybe three good episodes in the entire series, the rest range from skippable to very skippable. 
Conclusion - I wish I had some explanation for the absolute explosion of popularity this series had. Is the fanbase primarily 12-15 year olds watching their first anime? Do people just look at the art and not read the subtitles? Is there a waifu in the manga I don't know about? Whatever it is, it should be made more clear, so people like me know to just skip this show, skim the manga, and rewatch Hunter x Hunter instead.",4,MadScientist001

                Demon Slayer is good. People who like demon slayer are not good because they gave this show nearly a nine out of fucking ten on here and it is not that good. Like I said though, it is good, it's just not 9/10 good. This review is gonna have two parts, one is an actual review of the show, and the other is a critic of people that review shows.
Part 1, my actual review.
Story: Tanjiro is a good upstanding kid, who is very nice. He finds out demons are real when they kill his whole family. Miraculously, his sister survives, but she has become a
                  demon. Normally demons can't resist killing and eating humans, but Nezuko is different, she can resist her urges. Tanjiro enters the demon slayer corps so he can protect himself and his sister as he investigates demons for a possible cure for her.
Wanting to return your sister to normal is a little more thoughtful than most shonen motivations, like wanting to be a big stwong myan who can beat up da bad guys :3 So it's not fucking awful, but just because it's not terrible doesn't mean it's amazing. It's just good ok. It's not like some fullmetal alchemist or berserk level shit, but it's definitely a solid motivation.
I like the demon slayer corps. Most of the time, the worst thing in shonen, or in any franchise, is when the main character must join an organization of people with powers as soon as he gets powers. MHA for example, I really fucking hate UA high, and in Harry Potter, hogwarts is fucking trash. But that's a different plate of cookies for a different glass of milk. In demon slayer it's not that bad, it's actually kinda cool. I feel like Tanjiro still has a lot of freedom and doesn't have to deal with asshole 2-bit upper ranks that much.
Tanjiro has some hidden backstory that hasn't been fully explained in the anime yet, that has to deal with muzan and the one dude that almost beat him and the earrings and the sun dance shit. I've read the manga so I know more about it. I won't spoil it, but don't worry it's not a gay bitch backstory like ""Ah yes we are the really strong guys and are tanjiro's ancestors which means he is actually one of the really strong guys"". So once again, demon slayer thankfully avoids being cliche trash, but what the actual plot is isn't that good either. Like it's not bad, but it's just kind of boring once you find out what it is.
Now in terms of plot progression, demon slayer is really just about killing a bunch of demons as you find them, until there are no other demons but muzan, and then kill muzan. This is a problem because Tanjiro basically hands off the main plot, which is curing nezuko, to a different character and leaving her with it for the entire story while he goes off and fights demons, until she eventually figures it out. Now I know that fighting the demons helps her with her research because she needs muzan's blood, but that's a really inactive role tanjiro plays, because he's just collecting blood, but we're not actually learning anything, like why she need's muzan's blood for this when she already has it, or why she needs so much of it, or what she's actually doing with it, or how it cures nezuko, or literally anything about demon biology at all, which kinda sucks because I wanted to know that. I probably made it sound worse than it actually is, but it is kinda gay when you think about it.
Art: This is probably gonna be the most controversial part of this review because all of you dickheads think this show has the best animation on planet earth, but it doesn't. It doesn't even have the best animation of this year. I'm gonna cut the bullshit and just talk about episode 19 right now. I was reading the demon slayer manga, pretty far into it, when all this commotion starts about the new anime. I wasn't going to watch the anime at first, but all the big talk about ep 19 convinced me. I wanted to see if it was really that fucking good. And uh.... it wasn't. So the really apeshit kickass animation starts when tanjiro activates the fire sword shit, and then nezuko uses the burning blood on it and they have the explosion decapitation shit on the spider dude. That's the big hype animation moment. And yeah its p good, I'll give it mini round of applause and shit. But in terms of pure spectacle, it really pales in comparison to other fights. Saitama vs Boros i think still remains the most well animated fight scene ever, it is unmatched in terms of pure spectacle. Now you could argue that maybe it's the emotional moments that complimented the fight that made it so good, this part is supposed to be about art but I'll go on a side tangent just for you :kissy face: Todoroki vs Deku in MHA s2 was more emotional, and had better animation, and so was All Might vs All for one in s3, and I don't even like that show. ""Oh but that didn't come out this year bleehhh!"" you know what did come out this year? Mob psycho 100 s2. Yeah that's right you fuckers, I bet you forgot about that one. MP100 is honestly so good that every other show this year needs to be moved down one full point out of respect. Mob psycho 100 had much better animation than demon slayer, and more than one time too. Almost every major fight I think was animated better. Mob psycho 100 s2 was a massive animation project, and used almost no computer graphics. demon slayer uses a shit load of computer graphics, you just can't tell because you're a baby. But almost all the effects in this show (fire, water, lightning, smoke, etc) is cg. That's right, even the fire on tanjiro's sword in ep 19 is cg. It's a really good cg, but it's still cg, you can thank demon slayer for being the next big step forward in cg anime, and that's it. Cg is kind of killing traditional art which I really respect so this miffs me a bit.
Ok now that that's out of the way I can talk about the rest of the art. The animation is VERY consistent, which means it doesn't have those clearly low budget moments where everything looks like nuclear anus. That's pretty good, and I'm really happy about that because Dr. Stone's animation is about to fucking kill me with how bad it is (dr stone manga is actually really good in terms of art though). So yeah most of the points I'm giving it for art is coming from just that. The animation is NEVER bad in this show, and I'm grateful for that.
Character design is amazing in this show, background work is really good too. The wisteria is beautiful and I love it. I'm tired of talking about art so I'm moving on.
Sound: Decent ost, baller opening theme
Character: The first thing I noticed about demon slayer is that there's no dumbass bitch characters in this show. Oh shit now I actually kind of feel bad that I said that because there is one really fucking awful character in this show that I forgot about. And it's nezuko. I am not afraid to do this. Nezuko is bad. I want to slap all of you who are mad right now in the face and scream at you that she's bad. I won't go as far as to say nezuko has no character, because she does have character, it's just not much. I will fucking slap your shit if I catch you liking this character just because she looks cute. Look beyond the cute exterior and see the barren shell within her, devoid of what a good character should have. Nezuko can't even fucking talk, has no opinions, and barely get's any screentime. She is static, which isn't inherently bad, but it's just annoying in her case because everyone likes her when there's nothing likeable about her beyond the fact that she's a dumb baby. 
Whew. Besides that there are only good characters. Oh fuck. Oh shit. I just remembered. This is actually really funny because this bit isn't even scripted I just actually forgot that muzan existed. Muzan sucks monkey ass. He's evil because he's evil and he wants to live forever and that's his only goal. His personality is that he's evil. His powers are kinda lame in a show where a set of fucking bongos can be used as a lethal weapon. I really hate the way he's characterized. There's one scene where he kills one of his own guys, which shows that he's evil because he killed a guy on his side, which means he'll definitely kill a guy that's not on his side. I hate villains that teamkill, because they usually do it because one of their goons was annoying or disappointed them. Like, if you're waging war on humanity and they're starting to win, it's not a good idea to start killing your own forces out of frustration, because that's only helping the good guys win. Muzan is kinda retarded because he does this all the time and has no redeeming villain qualities to make up for it.
Ok now for the good characters, for real this time. Tanjiro, inosuke, and zenitsu are fucking great. The thing that makes them so good is that they're all idiots but none of them realize it. There is no voice of reason in their group, which is amazing because that allows all the wacky chaos to ensue during downtime between fights. Tanjiro is way too nice, and assumes the best out of all people. This is funny because he often times won't even realize someone hates him because he's just such a good guy. I'm getting tired of snarky protagonists, and tanjiro isn't snarky at all, he's a total bro that I would hang out with in real life. Inosuke, aka funny pig man, is one of my favs. His character is a little shallow, though, as he is too simple minded to have actual emotional conundrums. Inosuke is good because he's like the badder one of the group. Every shonen good guy protagonist has to have a not as good guy sidekick (vegeta, sasuke, killua kind of, bakugo who is the actual worst character of all time) inosuke is like that, except he's not edgy at all, so he's great. I never realized how likeable the not as good guy can be until they made him not an edgelord. He's like all the things that were good about bakugo, like being angry and wanting to be the best fighter, without the inferiority complex, shit behavior, and shit backstory. He's also funny and a pig, which makes him funny and a pig. Zenitsu is good because he completes the trifecta of idiocy in the main group. Inosuke and taniro are like opposites, yet zenitsu seems opposite to both of them. This means that each character in the trio has completely different, unique responses to every situation, which means the audience will be able to get attached to and identify with at least one of their view points. Zenitsu is also funny. He's technically the badass character when you think about it. Every show has to have the silent guy who's secretly a badass. Zenitsu is like that, but if instead of being silent he was an absolute pussy but actually the strongest guy ever. So yeah those guys are awesome and I love them.
Enjoyement: I enjoyed it.
And now for part 2 which no longer exists because it violated the guidelines. It was really interesting and probably would have completely revolutionized the anime industry with how profound it was. What an absolute tragedy.",7,Bubalubagus

                I absolutely cannot complain about the pristine art and the sound-track (Episode 19 amiritee) or the fight-scene execution. The manga is pretty meh despite the semi-interesting plot, but action mangas are really hard to appreciate without seeing the fighting on full display. 
The ONLY thing I can complain about is that the character development is a bit shallow, and Tanjiro is very 1-dimensional. After the 2nd demon, it's like OK, yes Tanjiro just wants a proper send-off for each demon, and each demon has their story etc. but the overall development of each pillar and demon is lackluster. But the manga itself is lacking in
                  that regard, so I think given what they could, U-Fotable did an excellent job to spice up this anime.",10,jin_cha

                I've seen many people say that the story of Demon Slayer is mediocre and average and the show is simply carried by the animation. However just because the plot isn't necessarily unique the same goes for many popular shounen series however what makes this series so popular is the way they go about the plot and how it is carried out. while anime with extremely intricate plots such as steins gate and terror in resonance have their merits sometimes a simple series that offers hype throughout is just as good. a series doesn't need to have deep meaning or philosophy behind it if it is
                  simply entertaining and that's what demon slayer is.Entertaining. the Fights are phenomenal and although they may be predictable that doesn't take away from the heart and effort that goes into every second of every fight. the 3 main characters all compliment eachother well and their interactions are always entertaining to see, they are not exactly the most well developed characters yet but i have no doubt that they get more development as the show continues.
in conclusion sometimes a simply story truly is the best option and demon slayer is definitely entertaining. both the soundtrack and animation are top tier and all these factors contribute to making demon slayer a great show with potential to be the next big shounen",9,raphaelM

                The Narration, the story telling, the protagonist...everything is so predictable. And I wasn't able to really care about the hero because instead of dialogue they kept doing these aweful narrations and speeding up the training and storyline. The art and animation was amazing. I really wanted to like it because a lot of my online friends recommended this but I couldn't go past the 5th episode. It was like I was torturing myself. I literally was calling everything that was happening. If I wasn't, it wasn't impressive enough or impactful enough for me. The dialogue was as if it was written by me. And I
                  am not a good. If you are just in it for the blood and gore, the great animation and you are new to animes...then its fine.

                A generic battle Shounen anime reskin. If you're into such things go ahead and watch it, but don't make the mistake of hoping for a well thought out story or characters with any depth.
The story in itself is simplistic and it could come out as a positive but unfortunately it doesn't. The script for each episode in its core is the same. Tanjiro gets a mission from a crow to eliminate a demon in a city, he goes there and kills them. There should really be something in between all of that but to call it something or to even mention it would be too
                  much praise, alas I will.
There is a pathetic attempt to try to make you sympathize with the demons being slain, and honestly, if you do sympathize with the demons, great... I guess. If you don't, no worries you're perfectly sane and not easily taken advantage of.
To give some credit, Tanjiro's training was interesting in itself and had more depth than any other moment in the series.
The art and music in this series is phenomenal and all credit goes to Ufotable and their amazing staff, hoping their next project delivers the same quality as they have in the past.
Characters get a five out of ten and that's what they feel like most of the time, characters with questionable design (particularly the pillars) and with one dimensional personalities. The main trios humour scenes are basically the same joke over and over again, Zenitsu being a  borderline perv, Tanjirou shunning him and boar head guy being clueless, much like the fans of this show.
All that aside I'm rating the anime a five out of then thanks to its animation and... eh. Thanks to its animation.
PS. If someone hypes up episode 19 to you, ill give you a spoiler free summary of the episode, so you don't get dissapointed. It's the same as the other episodes, with higher animation quality, and well inserted music and a classic shounen power escalation.",5,NoEmoNoSex

Ok, honestly this is a classic in the making, once season two comes out and if it is as good as ep 19-26 in the first season this anime will go down as a classic and thanks to ufotables amazing CGI use, amazing sound design, and a good story that gets elevate through the characters and the things I said above. Literally, just look up gigguk's video on demon slayer and that is my review I literally agree with like 100% of what he said in that video. But if you don't want to I'll explain why this is a
                  masterpiece and a future classic. It takes a simple plot of crow tells tanjiro where to go, tanjiro goes there, the demon shows up and tanjiro kills the demon and sets it free. But with this simple plot, the story behind it is amazing, Tanjiro goes down the mountain to sell things for his family to make money since his dad died he needed to become the father in the family, he starts going back up but is stopped as a good friend worries about tanjiro going up the mountain at night as demons could get him and so tanjiro crashes at his place and heads up early next morning. But only to come back and see his family murdered and his sister turned into a demon. And so tanjiro meets a demon slayer who tried to kill his sister and saved her as the demon slayer saw that tanjiro's sister is not a normal demon and so from that day Tanjiro pledges to slay all demons to set them free from this curse that they have and fix his sister. And tanjiro is an outstanding character because yes his is like every shounen mc but does not have that childish-ness and naive-ness that most shounen mc's have but has the kind-heartedness they all share(yes i got that from gigguk's video on demon slayer). The way Tanjiro acts with the demons and how right before the demon dies they show the story behind that demons life before they became a demon and why they became one. Next is the sound and boy is the sound design amazing, not only is the sounds spot on with how it would actually sound irl the visuals the swords have with the varieties of breathing types like water beast insect lightning flame flower love mist moon serpent sound stone sun and finally wind breathing all have distinct visuals and moves that are (as gigguk puts it) eye-jizzingly awesome.",10,iTzSponge-_-

                Lets break this down into the usual obligatory categories.
Story:
Kimetsu No Yaiba (Demon Slayer) follows a generally episodic shounen story. Whilst there is a wider narrative arc and the villain is introduced unusually early into the story for these sorts of shows, do not expect any meaningful narrative progress throughout the entire course of the 26 episodes. Expect several training arcs and a fair few enemies of the week, and that’s about all you really get. The lack of substance is just where our problems begin however, since the poor writing manifests itself in further problems. The fights have no weight because the show fails to
                  realise any meaningful stakes the vast majority of the time. The enemy is some random demon that we know we die and Tanjiro rarely seems to particularly struggle to kill them. They even try and make us care about the dying demon by showing us snippets of tragic back-story, this is a tale as old as time when it comes to poor writing. The reason the fight in episode 19 has so much impact is not just because of the gorgeous sakuga but even more importantly because the fight has the closest thing to stakes in the show with Nezuko’s safety actually being on the line for once.
Art:
My earlier talk of episode 19’s sakuga binge brings us nicely into art. It’s consistently good and the battle scenes are times quite visually impressive. The variable width lines in the character designs also look remarkably good, giving the entire show a nice aesthetic. The CGI is mostly to the show’s benefit too. At times it is still obnoxiously visible and you wonder why they didn’t try to blend it better visually with the surrounding scenes. But after changing my perspective and looking at it as though it was a mixed media art piece, I didn’t find it unpleasant. Regardless of how well the CGI blended in with the rest of the animation, the overall experience of the aesthetic is nice. In general there is nothing to complain about with this show’s art and animation.
Sound:
The OST of this show is unfortunately a disappointment. The music and sound design in this show aren’t bad, but with poor writing in tow the least they could do is have some great music to build up the anticipation and hype in the moments when it’s needed. Instead the music made me feel nothing, and the absence of the kind of intense tracks you expect to hear in shounen OST made the fights in turn feel lacklustre when they didn’t have the most beautiful of sakuga to back them up.
Characters:
A large proportion of the main cast of characters are one-note with a single personality trait to define them. They are not completely irredeemable though. At least one of the characters surprised me with how happy I was at their reappearance after disappearing for a few episodes. But since this was near the conclusion of the show, perhaps it was just Stockholm Syndrome. Even so, the characters surpassed my extremely low expectations so there is that.
Overall:
If you don’t like the aesthetic of this show then don’t watch it. If you do like the aesthetic of this show, then consider still not watching it. But if you particularly like shounen and well-animated action fights then you might as well give it a shot if you haven’t already by this point.",6,AlaskanMalamute

                I don't get it. I just don't get it. So this is  - I guess - pretty much the most watched anime ever made. The movie is the top grossing Japanese movie EVER. Think about that. More than Kurosawa. More than any Ghibli movie. 
And I don't get it. I'm at episode 9 now and every episode so far has been the most formulaic, predictable and ordinary shōnen crap I have seen in a while. 
And it's got it all. A whiny hero who has to yell out every move he makes before making it, one-dimensional cliché villains who laugh and cackle as they
                  taunt the protagonist, run of the mill action scenes of the kind you'll see in pretty much every anime made for teen boys and stupid internal monologues that bring nothing to the story whatsoever. 
The only thing this has going for it is the setting in Taishō-era Japan, which is kinda unusual and adds the single redeeming factor to this otherwise bland experience. 
I have no idea why this has become such a massive hit. Sometimes I feel like I live in a world where everyone is on crazy pills. Or maybe standards are just extremely low now? Either way, Kimetsu no Yaiba sure doesn't deserve the hype. It's really nothing special. It's not even particularly entertaining. 
Also the villain is Michael Jackson. Fight me.",3,Abbeyland

                The animation is top notch. The soundtrack is perfect and goes beyond what you can expect from an anime shounen.
The story is not surprising, but it is intense enough to go unnoticed. What I love most about the script is the view we get from the past and sometimes during the manga I cried and it's no different in the anime and it's not going to be, because so far ordinary scenes that I spent right in the manga in the anime really thrilled.
With the exception of Tanjirou, the other characters do not have a good background, but their personalities are striking and extremely defined.

                So lets get this started!
I watched this show because of numerous recommendations from all of my friends including friends who don't normally watch shonen anime. I took my time before watching this because i usually try to stay away from anime with too much hype around it.
So to give you an idea, i grew up on shonen anime and still enjoy a few to this day such as MHA and yu yu hakusho!
I was highly disappointed with Demon slayer.
The animation is cool, but that is the same as playing a video game for the graphics.
The story is boring and almost every single Shonen trope you
                  can possibly think of is in this show. If you think about watching it check out a different shonen, it probably has some of the same tropes without the writing being so lazy.
So usually when the story in an anime is basic you rely on your love of the characters to get you through right? Not this anime. I myself could not connect with a single character in the show!
all the characters are 2 dimensional boring shonen characters that all have tropes that have been done before....and better.
so all in all i wouldn't recommend this show to anyone because there is better anime out there and this show is a waste of time",3,Wrokk
38000,"
                I absolutely hate this anime. It is the most overhyped thing I’ve ever seen. When I watched it, it was actually somewhat enjoyable since it’s so basic, but seeing everyone rave over it like it’s the best thing since sliced bread has soured any enjoyment I have for it because I am constantly faced with the fact that people ignore some masterpieces for average shows like this. 
Im all for letting people do whatever they want and being happy but we don’t need more people arguing at me and trying to cancel me online because I don’t like Demon Slayer. The fans are rabid. 
The
                  characters are all tropes. The mc is nice and polite and hardworking. Zenitsu is the timid incompetent one with a hidden power. Inosuke is the loud angry one. Literally where else have we seen this before? Everywhere. They’re not specifically BAD, just boring. The other ones like the pillars weren’t really introduced much, but they are ugly. Mitsuri’s design drives me insane and people can’t take my opinion when I tell them I hate it. 
Some spoilers for the anime (I think episode 19 or so): The random savior abilities introduced with no prior mention is so terrible. Tanjiro is one second away from death but oh thank god he suddenly remembered a special power from his dead dad that has never been mentioned before until this point. It would’ve been more acceptable if he had like mentioned it at all or foreshadowed it but it really looks like it was just brought in to save him from death. 
And by the way, the characters never develop. At the end of the series we see Inosuke feeling bad that he lost and realizing he’s not the best…. For a few episodes until he completely reverts back to how he was before. It would’ve been amazing for him to reflect on it and respect his fellow ‘slayers a little more because of it, but no, he’s just silly little Inosuke again. 
And you fans need to stop telling me to read the manga. I won’t waste my time. The only thing that saves this is the animation so why would I read something that has no strong point. If it’s “sad” I don’t care, how could I feel sad over poorly done characters. If it “gets better” I don’t care, it shouldn’t take 25 episodes to get good at all no matter how much it progresses. 
Not to be that person but Attack on Titan is a good example. The first season is nothing like the rest of the show and it’s basic in comparison, but it’s still interesting. It’s exciting and unique. Demon slayer’s first season may just be a prologue but it needs to be an interesting one to keep people actually going back for the next seasons. 
If you catch me watching demon slayer’s sequels it will ONLY be so that I can slander them with actual basis and not be uninformed with my hatred. 
TLDR: don’t worship mediocre shows.",5,gwem

                When Demon Slayer first came out, I wasn't into it. I just thought it was too basic a shounen for me to really want to watch, so I dropped it after episode three.
Man, was I wrong.
This is one of the best anime of the year and probably my favorite I've seen from Ufotable. (Don't quote me on that. I haven't seen Fate/Zero.) Ufotable has this way of animating that uses traditional and cg animations. Personally, I thought the cg stood out like a sore thumb sometimes. Especially during the fights, it just looked awkward. But, what it does great at is the use of cg
                  to mimic dynamic camera shots. It looks perfect and really sucks you into the fights. Even more than that is the way it blends with the traditionally animated characters. They really fly off the screen in every fight.
The show is about a boy named Tanjiro who's sister gets turned into a demon. He becomes a demon slayer to find a cure to save his sister. If you ask me, this is an amazing set up for a shounen series. It allows us to connect to the main character better because we can get behind his goal of saving his sister.
He and his sister, Nezuko (who is super cute, btw), are both great characters that I was really connected to. The side characters were also pretty good, but they made me smile more than cheer. What I mean is, their fighting didn't hit me as much as their charm and funny nature.
I absolutely loved this show and I really recommend this show to shounen fans everywhere. Even if you aren't usually into shounen anime, this might be the perfect gateway. I cannot wait for season 2, or a sequel movie or whatever they're doing.",9,Blazeisachicken

                I really enjoyed this Anime mostly because of the OSTs and Art, although some people may dislike the Art I think it's perfect and couldn't have been any better. Not to mention the animation is one of the greatest I've seen in all anime. The only thing I'd change is the story but it's still great as it is. The character development could be better. The OST and Music in this anime are a perfection and fit the style. Overall I really enjoyed this anime and you should definitely watch it! It has the best Animation and OSTs I've seen in a while.

                Demon Slayer is a prime example of a bad manga, being turned into a better anime. 
As someone who enjoys shounen's, one that I haven't been able to get behind is Kimetsu no Yaiba. Here's why (without spoilers).
Story (5): Kimetsu no Yaiba follows the basic shounen formula that we've all seen before, the whole ""MC has an at the time unreasonable goal, so they work up to this goal, through life or death situations"" oh, and sprinkle in some plot armor as well. While the story of Kimetsu no Yaiba is easy to follow, it isn't the most original, however it is enjoyable on a
                  first-time viewing. I'd say that that is the main theme with this show, it's not a bad experience, it's just one of those ones where you watch it again, and you wonder what you actually liked about it.
Art (10): The art of this anime is its saving grace, it's just, wow. The art while simplistic, brings this whole anime to another level, making every scene that much enjoyable to watch.
Sound (8): the anime has no issues with sound, and the VA's are pretty good.
Character (5): The characters of Demon Slayer aren't the worst I've ever seen. They just don't seem to stand out to me.
Enjoyment (7): It is overall an enjoyable experience, I understand why people like the show, it's just plain and basic when you actually take a moment to digest the plot.
Overall: In the end, I would say that it's up to you if you want to watch this show, it really depends on the person. I would just be prepared for another basic shounen though. But whatever floats your boat.",5,TheBluestBlue

Everyone should watch it. Dont drop just watch. Anime will swallow you ^^.
Story is not so special but inside of it, it s awesome. Almost everything calculated for main character and it feels normal. That s the good thing about story.

                It doesn't matter the perspective I take at this anime, I can only see something that was artificially hyped as meme. No, the art doesn't compensate.
The music is meh, that's it. I can barrely notice it's there.
The characters, my god. How far in anime cliche can you go. There is an epsode that shows the 
""hashiras"", which are some elite warriors and stuff (trying to keep spoler free), and all of them seem to have the sole purpose of covering every common cliche personality in anime. You have the shy girl who likes all the dudes, you have the emo/dark boy, you have the calm
                  badass one, you have the quiet girl who is strong AF, you have the expressionless faced dude with a overly hyped voice all the time, the uncontrolled assh*** who is overly vioplent, holy molly how can you pick so many cliches in 1 anime.
The story follows a very basic formula, MC has an issue that involves a girl and goes in an adventure to solve the issue, just to find out a bigger picture problem and somehow he is the chosen one. Omega bruh

                Simply the most excited anime i have watched since season 3 of Attack on Titan.
From the very first episode you are hooked on the main characters.  The relationship Tajiro and Nesuko is so beautifully delivered you cannot help but root for them at every step of the way.  The pacing of this show really shows what can be delivered within a 24 episode format.  With each story arc, consisting no more than 3 episodes, the characters develop in a suitable but also noticeable way. 
Now, the animation.  It is absolutely stunning.  With ever passing second the animation becomes more stunning
                  than the last.  The fight sequences are perfect, absolutely perfect and the emotion told through the animation alone is enough to tell a very engaging story.
Each new character added, whether Protagonist, or Antagonist , is necessary and serves as a simple but very effective driver for progressing the story.
Inosuke is quite possibly the most perfect character to provide balance to all the other characters in this show.

                The show is so wonderful. It should be a show that others are inspired by.

I do not believe that is an overstatement. The story isn't 100% original, however, the directions they have been taking are new and not overdone. This is very rare for an anime.

                Those who believe that Kimetsu no Yaiba is the anime of the year and the face of shonen, I genuinely wonder what sort of standard they are holding Kimetsu no Yaiba to. Under no circumstances would I even BEGIN to rank this poorly generated cookie cutter anime among even the most MID modern productions.
This was probably the most unenjoyable and un-interesting anime I have watched to date. This arc was honestly no different.
The story is the most repetitive part of this whole mid fest. Goes a little something like this:
Step 1. Summoned to fight a demon
Step 2. Discover the demon
Step 3. Enter 10 minutes of
                  only dialogue
Step 4. Begin fight scene where demon is injured, slayer is injured, over and over again
Step 5: Flashback for Slayer
Step 6: Slayer gains new info or skill
Step 7: Demon is decapitated
Step 8: Begin recovery montage for Slayer.
It is the same 8 things. Over and over again without failure.
While there may be no filler in the episodes, each episode feels like it's half filler within itself, surrounded only by useless dialogue that contributes nothing to the storyline or random filler 'side-quests' that don't impact the end result at all.
I wanted to like this series. I did, I really truly did. The borderline caustic fanbase and equally as toxic marketing made it seem like what you may have heard it to be: the shonen of shonens. However, when multiple children portrayed as such, both in the show and outside of the show (in fan fiction), are sexualized out the wazoo, it made it EXTREMELY difficult for me to begin watching this series and come at it with a clear mind and heart. ITS WEIRD TO MAKE FAN FIC OF NEZUKO OKAY.....
n e who, the art is the only thing Kimetsu no Yaiba has going for it. It's what kept me watching and from dropping this show completely. The fight scenes that ARE different (which is extraordinarily rare) are a sight to see with your own eyes.
The sound is repetitive and is re-used for like 10 episodes at a time.
Characters are ok but I really expected more from all the rage surrounding Kimetsu no Yaiba. This shit is mid as mid comes.

                Demon slayer in my opinion is easily one of the most overrated anime of all time. This anime is incredibly mediocre, generic, and flat out boring.
Story- 5
The story for demon slayer is extremely generic. It's the second most overused shonen story. It isn't anything unique. It's just about saving someone.
Art- 8
The art in demon slayer is the only good thing about it. The art is the only reason people like this show. People act like this show has the best animation of all time but I completely disagree. I've seen better. The only reason people say that is because the people that say that don't
                  watch any other anime besides this.
Sound- 7
I didn't really like the sounds. They played the same thing over and over again and it got annoying. 
Characters- 3
The characters in demon slayer are 2- dimensional losers with little to no emotion. Tanjiro is like your typical shonen protagonist so fixated on achieving his goal that be becomes just boring. Nezuko sucks. She has no emotion at all. The only reason people like her is because she looks cute. Zenitsu is a coward. He is so annoying. The other guy is just like your typical character that likes to fight. Nothing unique about it.
Enjoyment- 4
I did not enjoy this anime. It was like I was rewatching every other anime I've seen. This anime doesn't do ANYTHING unique AT ALL. It's so cliche and just bad.
Overall- 3

It's so averagely written and painfully unfunny that I can't bring myself to watch another episode. I could have trudged through the rest of the series had it not been for the excruciatingly annoying Zenitsu character. I get it, he's a coward that's also a complete badass. I
                  don't need him to yell every single line and overreacting to every situation. It gets so tiring, especially with the addition of Inouske (who, by himself, I could handle at least). Both of these characters together make the show damn near unwatchable as it detracts from the serious tone set from the beginning of the show. All that being said, the animation is jaw-droppingly gorgeous and the action is very well-directed. Every fight feels tense and flows smoothly, almost never using cheap tricks to save on animation. Now back to the negatives: Nezuko. How can you set up such an interesting character and then never deliver on the premise of that character? You slap a muzzle on them and make them a plot device. Seriously, I was waiting for so long for Nezuko to shed her bamboo mouth trap and actually become a character to care about, but no, she's relegated to being the tacit, gentle waifu that can't talk back ever and just listens to people talk at her. Come on! Being turned in to a demon and constantly struggling to not eat humans is such a cool concept for character growth and this is how you treat it? Now before you say ""oh well it's to stop her from eating humans"" They already addressed that by having the old man put a spell on her to make her defend humans! (which is stupid in and of itself, but if it got rid of the muzzle, I wouldn't mind as much) That previous fact makes her character even worse and takes away her agency as a character. All in all, I was pretty disappointed with this show and probably will not pick it back up. It's a decently to poorly written anime that occasionally has strokes of brilliance when it comes to animation, but other than that, it's pretty standard.",6,TheNightOwl234

Kimetsu no Yaiba, or Demon Slayer, is one of the most successful shows in the past years if not decades, but it also seems to do most things worse than typical shonen shows. In the end, you only truly enjoy watching Demon Slayer if you can completely shut down your brain and only pay attention to the pretty art and animation. If you ever have any plot questions while watching, they probably won't be answered. Which brings me to my first point: the plot.
The plot is truly horrendous; I pray that no one will ever finish this season and say that it is well
                  written. Prepare to die with questions such as why do demons exist?, why does Nezuko not need blood?, why can Sankonji do literal hypnosis/mind control on a demon without anybody ever mentioning it again?, why do the demon slayers not wear body armor?, and more.
Besides that, Demon Slayer skips what is usually a good part of shonen stories: a training arc. While I don't expect heaps of training episodes, I would've enjoyed watching Tanjiro do more than run up and down a mountain for several minutes. I mean, everybody is fighting with swords in this show, but we never really see Tanjiro learn how to fight or anything. Instead, we get the very engaging and super super interesting breathing training because as anybody knows, in a show about people with superhuman skills like lightning and flame who use expert swordsmanship skills to defeat terrifying demons, we all want to see the main characters practice breathing techniques.
On top of that, the characters in Demon Slayer are beyond terrible. Each of the main characters are a caricature and mainly boring. Tanjiro is the stereotypical shonen protagonist who suffered a terrible loss and he works hard to become strong while being a kind and considerate boy. There isn't a single ounce of nuance or complexity in his character, and he's only interesting to watch when he's fighting. I don't even need to elaborate on Zenitsu; all he really does is whine and complain, and he quickly becomes annoying to watch. And of course, Inosuke, the very hot headed, short tempered, stubborn, and battle hungry member of the trio. What is his goal? To fight people I guess. What a well written character.
I will admit that it is enjoyable at times to watch (mainly when the characters are just fighting, which, thankfully, is most of the episodes). The art is beautifully drawn, and the animation is stunning, but of course, everybody knows that at this point. All the amazingly made art and stunning fight scenes can't make up for the bad storyline and characters. The only person in this season whose goals I completely understand is Tanjiro.
TLDR; Watch the fight scenes on youtube instead, and don't watch this badly written show.",4,idkCookie

                Kimetsu could not be saved by it's looks. That's almost impressive in a sense given the incredible weight attractiveness carries. But I don't think all the top tier character designs, settings and artistic sensibility could save the dreary writing and plot on this one. This ship floats alright, just like the water bloated drowned corpse down the river Thames. Face down, air expelled through the mouth, bubbling out something that could be mistaken for human language. I really tried to like it as well. It was nice they hit the fast forward button on the training montage, but even adverts for laundry detergent might be
                  more fun when the show you're watching is about the relative drying speed of different brands of white paint.  It even attempts to pull the wool over our eyes by forcing some emotional moments between the goblin masked tutor and his pupil. Mmmm? When did I become invested enough to care whether they reunited or that he completed his training? Has anyone actually said anything remotely interesting to each other so far? 
This boil is festering, and it's close to popping… Maybe the real problem putting the bubonic in this plague is the completely average battle choreography and the minimal depth or sense. The 6/7th episode is a prime example with everything moving at a snails crawl. All that’s running through my mind is how was he able to stab one of the oni in the ground to begin with? Why on earth would he enter their “swamp” without any information about what was down there or if he could even survive? Why does his sister act as a total plot device? Why am I even watching this? These small questions were regularly nipping at the heels while going through my seven episodes. Y’know, but HOW and WHY did no one sort out that godforsaken big green demon in the training area? It had been there for how long killing trainees and no one had known or done anything  (the trainees were told that only demons who had consumed 1-2 people would be there right?)? How had the goblin mask not dealt with it in the first place? Why had he not investigated why all his trainees kept dying in the final selection? 
Of course, with a bit of a “chop chop you dunce” all of this could have been relatively tolerable, but no one has told Kimestu no Yaiba that an original sin in the internet age is being dull AND slow. That could just be a personal issue due to watching too many youtube videos in 1.75x though.",3,Cat_of_Anodyne

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is a masterpiece that has soared to the top as one of the greatest shounen anime to have been adapted from an equally exceptional manga.
From the first episode Ufotable has captured something truly amazing. The storyline is so well crafted and the animation is so masterfully done, it has this unique power to keep you coming back week after week. It's not everyday that I struggle to find the words to describe how truly beautiful an anime is, but there is just something about this anime that has set it apart from the shounen of the past.
As this is Ufotables first shounen
                  adaptation they had a really big task ahead of them, but if you have watched it you will see how they have managed to polish this show to shine like a star. There is so much they have done right in making this hidden gem look as polished as a diamond in a sea of shounen bronze.
Every fight scene is like a work of art, the way they combine the sounds, the attacks and the visuals of the element the fighter uses is something to be revered. This can easily be one of, if not the greatest anime of the past decade. I admit that there are several anime that made me cry during a single episode, but never has an anime made me cry almost every episode the way Kimetsu no Yaiba has.
This show is a testament to just how dedicated a studio Ufotable is, they have always been the gold standard in animation for CGI... This anime has found it's way into not only my own heart but those of many others who have been there since week one. And in no uncertain terms has earned its place as my all time favorite anime (sorry Akame ga Kill)!

                I very rarely have to drop anime, and this one was really hard for me to drop. The first 10 episodes were *fantastic*, an overall 9/10 approaching 10/10 for me. Then, everything changed when two new main characters were introduced (one had been shown before as a side character, but I paid him no mind because he was a side character).
At their introduction, I hated both Inosuke and Zenitsu equally. Inosuke was selfish, stupid, posed a danger to himself and others for no good reason, and had zero redeeming qualities. Generally the type of character that you can maybe tolerate if the rest of the
                  show is good. To his credit, Inosuke did start to improve over the next 6 episodes that I watched, and I could see his potential of becoming a tolerable character.
Then there's Zenitsu. I've never, in any other show, seen a character who is so bad that he singlehandedly brings the entire show down below a 5/10. Zenitsu is the worst character I've ever seen, and the sole reason that I couldn't keep watching the show. Every second he spends on screen he is screaming. And when he's not screaming about how scared he is, he's screaming about how much of a pervert he is. (*Very minor episode 11-16 spoilers for the rest of the paragraph) He's (re-)introduced in a super cringy scene where he is incessantly badgering a woman for affection who repeatedly tells him to leave her alone, and he never stops. Then he repeatedly pouts about the main character intervening and stopping his harassment of that random woman. Then he starts perving on the MC's sister at least through episode 16. Literally the only time he's ever not annoying is when he he's asleep, which is also the only time he's not a useless buffoon.
In a nutshell,  Zenitsu is the single most annoying character I've ever seen, and he has zero redeeming qualities and zero signs of improvement over the course of his first 6 episodes. He made each episode a pain to get through, to the point where I had to just stop.
On top of that, the introduction of these two characters also marks a huge tonal shift in the show. What was a show with a refreshingly mature and dark tone with the occasional tone-breaking comedy instantly shifts to boring shounen with awful characters and the dark themes that drew me into the first 10 episodes become the odd, out-of-place moments in a constant barrage of unnecessary, terrible, and forced comedy.
Literally the only reason this review is a 4/10 and not a 1/10 is because the first 10 episodes were amazing. If that early show had continued, this had the potential to reach towards my all-time top list. But a single awful character makes it one of only two anime I have ever dropped.",4,mddevice

                Where to start, this is shounen at its finest, none of that op character from the start garbage or that little annoying weakling or even that naive little kid, We have a protagonist who is dedicated and someone (sort of) starts off weak and has to go through years of training in order to turn his sister back into a human. Straight forward plot, not very unique but done damn right without the annoying fillers in between episodes, also pacing is a little slow but in a good way.

The storyline is just so amazing.
Each episodes has a continuity with meaningful plots & battles.
Being a snow mountain boy coming from a loving family, the harsh reality he had to face for his sister's sake is mind blowing.
What makes this anime impressive is that Tanjiro releases the demon from their curses & grudges. He acknowledges that these demons were once humans.
The desire to be stronger to protect his sister & for better world so that other humans do not feel the pain he experienced is exceptional.

                I can't highly recommend this anime. The artwork is amazing and unique. The characters are just enough different from the generic anime characters that they all feel like their own person. The story is, in my opinion, the weakest point of the anime, but the story itself is still very solid. Because the anime has a good base story, the great characters and artwork just shoot the anime into greatness. The characters develop at a good pace where even characters you may dislike at first may become one of your favorite characters in the series. Give it a shot if you have time!

                Probably the most overrated anime out right now. 
The first episode filled me with so much hope. The story really intrigued me. The animation was top notch. I was ready for something amazing. Boy, was I let down. The story was extremely boring and predictable, the dialogue was horrible, and the only thing saving this anime is the animation. 
The characters were so bland and/or annoying, it was hard to care about any of them. The main character is boring-- the typical good-natured shonnen protagonist that everyone seems to like. But that's all there is to him. The blonde hair dude is the most annoying
                  character ever written. I get he's a character, but did the writers have to go that extreme? And the sister is just...there.

                Kimetsu no yaiba is one of the most popular manga and anime in this generation, and now after watching it I can understand why this is a popular series, but in middle of series I feel like lost in the series, it’s because how the studio kind of let one to two place go of too long, if they could make it shorter it could be better, but that’s my opinion, other than that it was very good anime

                kimetsu no yaiba is a very good anime. the plot carries on with a lot of twists and turns, but is still something you can follow. the art and character design is something marvelous. overall, i gave this anime a 9. 
plot : 
the plot to this anime is not super special. yet, it is something that is fun to follow along with and includes many plot twists.
it all starts when tanjiro (the main character) goes into town to sell some charcoal. everything seems normal, and kind of boring if i am being honest. yet, when he begins his travel back home he is warned
                  about the demons that lurk at night. so, he stays with a family friend (or relative? i wasn't quite sure about that). in the morning when he begins to travel back, you get to see a bit about his character. you learn more about his sense of smell (which is honestly incredible. i enjoy how the 3 main characters all have good senses of something). when he gets back to his house, everyone is dead - except his little sister. this is the opening to the whole plot. this is what fuels tanjiro to become a demon slayer, along with his new demon sister whom he wants to cure. 
everything after this is pretty much a normal anime. it's a lot of adventure, and honestly the mission type thing reminded me of goblin slayer. i really did enjoy the whole plot line though, even if it seems kind of basic. how can you go wrong with a good adventure anime? unless the missions are totally boring...which these missions are always interesting. the best plot line though was the character development. 
characters: 
there are technically 4 main characters if you count nezuko (tanjiro's demon sister). but nezuko doesn't have much of a character development unless you would say her not harming humans would be a development. otherwise, we have the 3 main characters. tanjiro, zenitsu, and inosuke. these 3 go through so much character development. 
tanjiro started as a warm hearted guy who would never hurt anybody or anything. he is very soft, and a bit of a weakling. you see him throughout the anime getting stronger. not only in strength but mentality. he goes through a lot, killing demons for a living and all. keep in mind, he is only a teenager. the anime mainly follows him and his journey to learning how to kill demons. he goes from a literal baby, to someone who is tough and will practice all day everyday. 
zenitsu didn't have too much of a character development, but what did happen was pretty big for him. when he was first introduced into the anime, he was a total wuss and girl crazy (which of course, kind of stays with him). through the time he spends with tanjiro, he learns a lot of independence and how to cope on his own. as you can see in the natagumo mountain arc, even though he was terrified to go up the mountain, he went. whether it was for nezuko or not, he went up the mountain. and he faced great dangers, and withheld himself from turning into a spider. this is great character development for him as he was never able to be on his own in the beginning. 
as for inosuke, he learned how to become dependent and work in a team. from the start of his introduction you can tell how strong-willed and independent he was. he was always looking for a fight, and had no intention of working with other people. yet, throughout the anime - especially after he partnered with tanjiro and zenitsu - he begins to learn how teamwork is important. he also learns to not be so hardheaded and become a little less independent. this is miraculous for his character, and shows a lot of good development. 
art: 
the art of this anime isn't the best art i have ever seen. but, with my love for horror anime and gore, it was very good. i enjoyed the broad and distinct colors, and the way the characters were drawn. the robes for each character were well drawn and had colors that just fit right. along with that came death scene art. this is something a lot of anime don't do to my expectations. as in attack on titan, they don't have the best art for gore and horror. kimetsu no yaiba though...they made sure to make the blood a dark red and have more realistic scenarios for the art. yet, it was nothing too gorey like corpse party where it makes you want to throw up. the art was pretty incredible. another quick thing about the art is the cherry blossoms and pretty much any flower. those were all so beautifully drawn, especially the wisteria. 
overall:
this anime did a great job on everything. the op and ending songs were great, and the animation was amazing. the colors made everything and all the characters stand out. along with that was the plot, which was highly satisfactory. this anime is something i would definitely recommend to anyone who is into more adventure style anime.",9,peachylux

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is hands down one of the most visually compelling and technically brilliant anime I've ever seen. The sound design, animation and visuals are phenomenal,
...but the screenplay is absolutely appalling.
It's an anthology of dysfunctional relationships that flips between childish shounen-esque and gory psy-thriller at a whiplash-inducing tempo. One moment is chibi dolls emoting and shouting , the next is a macabre vignette of agony as someone is shred to pieces in bloody fashion. Both ruins the other, and it is my only qualm with the visual direction (I still put the blame on the story pacing and direction for this, as it is
                  a direct result thereof). The writers are bent on making every personality except Tanjiro and Nezuko so caricaturistically extreme that it's unbearable. It's so gratuitous that it's not even an effective juxtaposition, it's just ""Hey, get a load of this unequivocally terrible take on humanity; isn't that MESSED UP? Anyways, on to the next one"".
Each character represents some singular idea or trait, to the exclusion of all else. In all situations their actions are, without deviation, in line with this one trait. There is no development, no self-betterment; there is only flat, one dimensional action-reaction interaction. The dialogue is like watching a bunch of brick walls talking to each other, no one compromises or relents on anything. Each character expresses their singular trait, concedes nothing.
Tanjiro is literally a moral Mary Sue and I can't stand it. While certainly an incredibly powerful warrior, Tanjiro is not invincible on the battlefield; in terms of moral fiber, he bears no equal. Tanjiro is the perfect paragon of kindness and mental fortitude, he seems never to even struggle meaningfully. This flies in the face of the heroes journey and means that he never really learns or improves his inner self. This lack of development is in line with other characters, with the exception of villains, who will invariably experience a flashback that explains away their abhorrent behaviour and allows Tanjiro to once again shed a bitter tear as the demon crumbles to ash.
The story is mediocre and predictable at best, and I have little to say about it.
I have consumed media both within and without anime that have used the techniques described herin to great effect, but —like a mouthful of vanilla— Kimetsu no Yaiba takes each to such an incredible extreme that the effect is ruined. It causes me pain to see such a stunning work of animation done such injustice in its story that I can't justify recommending it to others.
I was able to finish the season on the merits of the visual experience alone, but my enjoyment was constantly dragged into the mud by all that I have mentioned above. Ultimately, I wanted to make sure that there was no incredible transformation at the end that will ""change the way I looked at the whole show"", but that unsurprisingly never arrived.",4,TheArcticGiant

                No doubt about it, the reason why I finished this series within a day was because the animation and art were stunning, and also the only reason why this show jumps from a 4/10 to a 7/10
That being said, the other portions of the show are WEAK. Fights are choreographed brilliantly, but the story's stale, the characters are mediocre, and the progression of power is just a terrible mess.
I think the biggest problem with this show is the mediocrity of it all, especially with the story.. It plays very ""safe."" When I watched this plot, I feel like i was watching something from 2003 because
                  the plot is so bland. Well, let's just say that shounen anime don't exactly need a compelling springboard in terms of overarching. I mean, look at One Piece. ""Lets get the ultimate treasure!"" isn't exactly a super well thought out plot. But it compensates that for with great characters, dialogue, and storyline progression. I mean, it starts out with Luffy helping out Zoro getting executed. Pretty exciting, isn't it? Here in Demon Slayer, you got the classic tragic backstory, classic training sequence, and classic random companions that are drawn towards him. All in all, very normal. If we want to see a classic shounen executing this well, there is the example of Hunter x Hunter. Main character trains, goes through exam, and gets companions. But which series had more impact? Naturally, Hunter x Hunter, because the execution is so much better. Even after the MC gets his random companions, they just keep on going through missions, which isn't exactly exciting. And then of course, there's the random throwing in with the MC meeting with the ""evil mastermind"" after being freshly promoted. The reason? Haha...there doesn't seem to be any, other than to force more plot development, as now MC is being chased down by the villain. Wow, that's pretty original.  And of course, the classic ""being put on trial"" trope. It's such a big one that I forgot where I first saw it...Bleach, maybe? Forgot. The story is forgettable and can by drawn by anyone who has watched shounen shows before. 
Power progression is also kind of a mess. MC get strong. Get stronger. Kill lower 12!!!! By the MC's 5th mission he'll actually turn into God because of how fast he is improving. Jfc, slow down buddy. 
Next, the characters. Actually, the characters aren't half bad. Inosuke and Zenitsu are fine, and the hashira, the person that trained the MC, and the people who forges swords aren't actually that bad. The problem is that they also aren't that interesting. These casts of characters are definitely not super archetypal, but again, it's not on the level of someone like Zoro. Another thing that bothers me is that these characters  really have no connection to the MC at all, really, but they end up being chummy with him within a few frames of interaction. 
Also, while I do say that the characters aren't half bad, that only goes for the good guys. I mean, do you really need a goddamned flashback for everytime a demon is going to die? Really dude? We really don't need a flashback  stating:""wow this guy was good but due to circumstances he became bad."" People are so afraid of having an actual bad guy. And let's not forget the main villain. For someone described as conniving and scheming, he's actually so stupid. He lets the MC meet him, lets him live, sends low level chumps after him, doesn't immediately chase him, etc etc. He's pretty dumb. He doesn't hold political power, doesn't conceal himself THAT well it seems, and controls demons through sheer brute force. Small brain. If this guy was actually smart and created an organization while still possessing absolute leverage of power over demons, he might be onto something. That'd be a little too smart though. 
Lastly, I'd like to talk about the worldbuilding. It doesn't exist. I figured out on like episode 16 that people who are demon slayers get commissioned money by random background character C that gets killed immediately after he says that. I mean, I know that the ""adventurers guild"" is as cliche as it gets, but it makes sense. Not everyone in the entire world will kill demons and risk their lives for absolutely nothing.  Naturally, there is compensation for getting rid of monsters in fantasy worlds with adventurer guilds, but in this show there was no such thing, or it wasn't explained until random background character C said so. I understand that shounens don't exactly need to have a lot of worldbuilding, I mean look at Jojo. But, it needs to make some sort of sense. Jojo explains everything that needs to be explained, and doesn't explain anything that does not. It keeps a minimal threshhold of explaining and worldbuilding, but it still does it, and it makes sense. Minimal requirements of worldbuilding are not present in Demon Slayer, and it kind of pisses me off. Like, there are signs of industrial age, but nothing gets explained. Like, people get commissioned but it never gets explained. Like, people cultivate through breathing techniques, but the system never gets explained. Especially this one, its like the show just throws out: people use breathing techniques to get stronger, but we won't really say how the different stances differ. Like, MC's head scar never gets explained or even MENTIONED. Food, countries, states, social system, etc, never get a mention. 
Anyways, that's the end of my rant. My conclusion is that this show is worth watching, but reading the manga probably won't be. This anime is good, because the animation is top of the line, but nothing else.",7,PixelB

                  it) you're likely to love it!",10,MC13_3

                Like other people have written already, a shounen does not need to necessarily have to be complex to be good. That being said, I felt that this first season of Demon Slayer (or Kimetsu no Yaiba) was too simple and beyond the art style and animation most of the show just felt pretty bland to me, or at least didn't really make me feel much of anything. I apologize for how negative this review comes off as, but the more I thought about it, I kept coming up with negatives rather than positives.
I think that the one area where Demon Slayer really did well with
                  the ""less is more"" idea was the animation and art style. Compared to other Ufotable works I think the designs and animation were much simpler and stylistic which had a very clean look and allowed for fluid more animation. However, as Ufotable has struggled with in the past, they really need to do better with their 3D animation if they are going to keep using it this much. Early on it actually looked really good and they mixed it in with their regular animation very well, but later on (I think in the Spider Demons arc?) they had multiple scenes in a short timeframe which were obviously 3D, I remember it seemed pretty bad while I was watching.
The voice acting was surprisingly good. I feel like they basically had every staple in the industry voicing someone even if they were only getting 2 lines (I had to keep looking people up since I was sure they wouldn't be doing such minor roles), and they all did their parts well.
As for the characters: I generally liked the cast of characters and I seem to have enjoyed the humor more than other people, the characters were also... pretty cliche, and it feels like they have the same conversations at least once every episode. The first half of the show also got pretty slow at certain points (despite how much action there was) because Tanjiro was basically the only important character who got speaking lines for episodes at a time, which made it feel a bit redundant and slow at times. Muzan is a kind of disappointing villain so far. I found him more interesting when I didn't know anything about him, and he has not really influenced the story in any meaningful way after the first episode.
Story-wise, there's not much to say. After the first episode, Tanjiro goes to become a demon slayer, look for a cure for his sister, meets the villain of the series, then he does bunch of random missions for 15 episodes until he meets the big boys and girls in the last few episodes. 
A psuedo-complaint is that Demon Slayer feels like a rehashing of things you'd find in other series. I believe my personal description of the series early on was ""Deku Jaeger meets Claymore meets Golden Kamuy"". This is not necessarily a bad thing as series copy each other all the time, but I also feel like Demon Slayer did nothing to really make itself stand out. 
My last grievance with the show is that I was not really impressed with any of the fights besides the one in episode 19. Although there was a lot of stuff going on and a lot of eye candy animation, the fights somehow felt super slow and dragged out for the most part. Honestly, there's nothing particularly wrong with any of the fights, they just fell flat for me. 
Despite all the stuff I said, I did binge the show in two days and I didn't feel inclined to stop watching during that time, so there is something here, but when I really think about it: Demon Slayer is a good looking show with very little story that didn't really make me feel any sort of way while I was watching it.",6,MrShmucker

                Kimetsu no Yaiba, more popularly known as Demon Slayer, satisfies the audiences - fulfilling the concept of the show's title. 
At first, I thought that this show is in a fantasy setting wherein adventurers look for a job -  killing demons just to earn for a living, or an isekai where the main character feels the urge to slaughter all monstrous human-eating demons. It's just like an anime where people kill mindless goblins.
I was wrong, though. It's in a normal traditional world. The plot is deeper than I could ever imagine. A shonen with a different flavor to offer. The world was seemingly peaceful
                  until humans found out that they are victims by the demons' killing intent. Only the demon slayer swordsmen can eliminate these beings with their very own swords. 
The characters were deeply rooted. Tanjiro Kamado does not only desire to kill demons but also to save his remaining family from suffering. He has a greater resolve than any typical main character of an anime. The demons were also interesting. They are existing not just as creatures with instincts, but ones who have their own will and goals in life. It gets you more attached to every character regardless of their background and screen time. Each has their own battles and resolve in their hearts that they want to carry out by all means possible. 
The plot and characters are matched with great animation and sounds whereby one can enjoy the show up to its fullest extent. The details in the fight scenes are amazing as well. 
This season is almost perfect in terms of pacing, introduction of characters, comedic relief, battles, and plot progression. The only reason why I did not give it a full score is because of my lack ot appreciation in the depth of story in the early episodes but objectively speaking, it was perfect. The intensity should be going up from bottom to top. I just wanted it to be very intense all the time for the sake of enjoyment.",9,jerusalem22

                	Demon Slayer é um anime extremamente interessante, não é sem razão que grande parte da comunidade ama esse anime, todavia, há alguns pontos de crítica que podem se fazer em relação a este anime.
 	Em primeiro lugar, quando vou assistir animes tipo Kimetsu não costumo ir esperando nada em termos de conteúdo, a minha análise sempre se dá por conta do quanto o anime em si é divertido de se assistir, sendo assim, nesse ponto o anime consegue acertar muito bem, as cenas de ação são em sua maioria impecáveis, animações de extrema qualidade acabam trabalhando ao favor do anime nesse quesito, transformando cenas de
                  luta em incríveis momentos que prendem total atenção de quem está assistindo. 
	Por outro lado, nem tudo no anime são pontos positivos, apesar de todos os elogios feitos as cenas de luta no anime isso também acaba promovendo uma das minhas decepções com esse anime. Existe um claro desbalanceamento de cenas de ação para cenas mais pessoais entre os personagens, isso faz a história fluir de maneira extremamente arrastada. As únicas partes que eu sinto que o anime é realmente interessante de se assistir são durante as lutas, parece que toda a história foi deixada de lado e isso faz o anime no geral fluir de maneira bem desagradável. Isso pesa muito para o desempenho do anime no geral, devido a essa discrepância de trabalho investido pra cenas diferentes, sinto que não consigo sentir nenhuma sensação de empatia por nenhum dos personagens, e isso, na minha opinião, acaba estranhando a minha experiencia com o anime.",5,heitoragts

                Kimetsu no yaiba (Demon slayer) such a very good anime to me.
First the story, I just want to say the story is obvious from the beginning till the end of first season and I am sure Kimetsu no yaiba can take the heart of the   people who watching on the first episode so people will enjoying the anime from the first episode.
The Art of Demon slayer is is very good from the visual with incorporating culture element that will give a more value to the art, and i am not suprising for the grapics, It's a Ufotable.
Well the sound, I bet not just
                  me, most of the people will be stunting when the action scene on episode 19 when the action run with the theme song, And a right music theme on every scene that can get our emotional up for a moment, And the sountrack for opening and ending it's a right music with the anime
Character, I still do not know yet all the characters because i do not read the manga, But there is 2 characters that i donot like they are Zenitsu And inosuke , I do not know what people think but i think Zenitsu charaters is disturbing he is too coward it's not as good as his power, For inosuke i only did not like the clothes with a pig mask and always naked body.
Enjoyment, Like i say the sound theme make me more drowning with Kimetsu no Yaiba, The art is more intersting, The action is good,  The characters of Tanjiro is right, and there is no ""Hentai element"".
Overall, Not a perfect but atleast Kimetsu no Yaiba is so far from disappointment.",10,Alledine

                Official Review: 
(NO SPOILERS)
Demon Slayer is becoming one of the more recognized Shounen Jump titles. Like MHA, Haikyuu!, The Promised Neverland and few others. Which is great, since the show is, at times, different but similar to other Shounen Jump formula's.
First Impression -
From the first episode, I thought this anime was going to be great from the start. (I know, call me a simpleton, but I wasn't wrong.) Simply because of the pacing and 'sense' of the direction it was going. (The animation helped too.) The pacing, in the beginning, was the best way to slowly dive into the world of Demon Slayer. Seeing the
                  characters progressed as the story did, kept me wanting to see more! (Especially at the very beginning) Other characters were introduced in a way that felted pleasing and interesting at the same time. (But not a lot of people talked about it, which sadden me, even though I didn't read the manga.)
Fight Scenes -
The fights are what people really like, that everyone can enjoy. how choreographed each fight is and is able to bring out different styles of unique powers and ability's in one scene and being on the edge of your seat when it suddenly becomes intense. Each fight is well done, entertaining, and exciting. Which is one of its biggest features! Respect towards Studio Ufotable and their craft!
Comedy -
The comedy in the series isn't too funny but also isn't terrible, there are moments where they want you to smirk or smile when something happens, but it feels pushed. (like My Hero Acadamea.) (The comedy part) For the most part, there are some really funny moments, at least.
The Main Cast -
I like Tanjiro as a character because he's different from your regular 'generic' protagonist. He's not overpowered, and not what I would say dense either. Buuuuttt, He's too kind… Not towards the demons specifically. But his attitude towards humans, like Zenitsu, Inosuke and others. For me, I would prefer him to be a little mean at times. Although his passion and drive to save his sister's, and other peoples' lives, is something more beautiful to witness. Like knowing when to be mad when fighting a demon, and knowing when to become more kind and diligent towards them, as he deals the final blow. But, not all blows are brutal and bloody, some give a warm feeling… Though at times I feel like he has a screw loose.
Speaking of a screw loose, Inosuke is the type of character everyone needs in their life. He's a hard head, and at times, an unreasonable grenade trigger. He definitely keeps the show interesting when he enters the room and is the most competitive of the group, which is fun to see. There are even times you wish he were a pet. He does act like that at times. Hope to see more of him in the future.
Zenitsu however, is a crybaby and the first person to run away from a fight, and it doesn't have to be a demon always. However, he has a little secret… that he doesn’t know. There are few moments where he's funny, and moments where you have to turn the volume down. But he's a good guy at heart, even if he looks desperate trying to get a girlfriend and get married, that doesn't make him a pervert… Idiot... ('Idiot' was directed to MBASEMENT) But overall a funny, loveable guy all around.
And then Nezuko! who's a demon, and the little sister of Tanjiro. That’s it... Sorry, I do like Nezuko, but I wished she could talk a little, even under the circumstances, like inner dialogue. (Kinda joking) I'm not joining your 'creepy Imouto cult' just because she's the little sister. Weirdo's. 
Alright, what I really think of her is, there isn't too much to say. She is cute (At times) and very reliable during a battle and has a great, even not strengthen the relationship she has with Tanjiro. She is very kind towards humans (Even as a demon) and tries to restrain herself from the smell of blood. At the moment there aren't too many unique characteristics about her, though, she what's giving Tanjiro a purpose to turn her back into a human. Which should be satisfying by the end of the series. (At least that's where I think it will end off with. Don't listen to me.)
Art Work - 
Studio Ufotable is incredible. I believe one of the biggest reason's this show has been so successful is solely because of what this studio is capable of. You won't be disappointed by the animation. So overall, 'jaw-dropping animation.' (Not that 'God-Tier' crap, everyone says.) 
What I also Liked - 
The other things I liked about this series was the subtle approach with each demon. Almost every demon had a story tell, and that’s because they were once human, and seeing where their decisions had lead them, eventually their deaths, pulled me, to feel sympathy for them, even if what they did was wrong. I wished they had a better life. (Even though it’s a show, there are people in the real world who struggle with similar things, that make them who they are today. And the consequences they soon face, aren't always pleasing.)
Final Statement - 
Other then that, this show is really something special. At the beginning it was hardly talked about, but now. It's being recognized by a lot of people in the community now. Which is awesome. You have to watch it to really understand how good it is. Don’t take some persons' thought or review and walk into the show with high expectations. Just enjoy what it is and what it brings, cause I did. In my option, it's not what other people call it 'A Masterpiece'cause I don’t think there's such a thing. (Please don’t go through my anime list'.) 
Unnecessary comment but added anyway - 
 I knew from episode 12 I had to keep watching because I knew there was going to be an episode where the animation becomes incredible… And I was right. I was probably one of few people that was keeping up with each episode as soon as it aired in subtitles on Crunchyroll, then episode 19 aired… Again, I knew it! It just felt special since I was one of few people that saw it before the rest of the world. (You have to watch the series to know) Again amazing work from Ufotable! Even tho I had the Pikachu face the majority of the time but was still very impressed. :3 Plus, I wouldn't be surprised if I saw a season two confirmed for 2020 or 2021, When the series ends. UPDATE: Apparently, there's going to be a movie sequel.
8.8/10 but Since MAL doesn’t have this, sora, rating system. I guess I'll leave it at a 'SOLID!' 9/10. It was GREAT!
I rarely do any kind of review but this was my first. Hoped it helped you! Bo-Bye.
PS: it really scares me Kanao and Shinobu have over 500 favorites, they point-blank creep me out. (JK,notreally.)",9,KiranHirota

                When I discovered that Kimetsu no Yaiba was a Shonen Jump manga adaptation, it didn't attract me at all, to know that it was going to be animated by Ufotable my reaction was surprising. So I decided to watch it and I can say that it was good. But there are things that makes the show just ok.
The premise of the show is really good at the first 5 episodes. The story about Tanjiro and his sister who has the curse of becoming a demon was interesting, to see how Tanjiro and Nezuko will survive this new life by themselves and to travel around the
                  country to find the cure for that curse was really enjoyable. The first episodes gave a sensation that this is one of those shows that you have to watch at night with a cup of wine to feel relaxed and get in the mood. But after finishing this show the main issue with Kimetsu no Yaiba is the pacing. When  the show is good it is REALLY good but when it hits the points of comedy and breaks from the battles it gets very annoying. Never felt a situation like that since Power Rangers Ninja Storm. 
As I said, this show doesn't know how to handle the shift in moods and situations. At first you get this story about the tragic life of these siblings and how they find people suffering from demons trying to kill many civilians as they can and had this serious tone but with a heart warming moments between Tanjiro and Nezuko. But then after the story inroduces more characters it really gets to a point of no return and annoyance and all of this is because of the new characters introduced.
First of all I don't get what was the idea of adding the Blondie screaming guy from part of author of the manga or if the direction of this character was going to be an annoying brat that could easily be on an stupid ecchi show and he would get away with. He is annoying, he doesn't talk, he SCREAMS, YELLS AND SHOUTS FOR EVERYTHING. I get that he is scared, but giving him the description of cowardly screaming guy and that wants to bang a girl as quick as possible is annoying and not funny. Courage The Cowardly Dog has more balls than this guy and not only him there are some characters that when they talk they don't add anything to what is going on among the characters and this can be seen with the Bimbo Girl that Kana Hanazawa was voicing with pointless commentary that is on YuGiOh levels but 10x more idiotic and without anything to add. Also Her dialogue is pure filler with things like ""I love this person because he said Hello"" ""Oh My He said the word"" it is just pure non sense and filler. This feeling can also be applied to Yushiurou that also says stupid things like ""Miss Tamayo is so cute"" and the context he says it is not appropiate or it feels like some stranger came to the writting room and add it to the script without the knowledge of actual writers.
The rest of the characters are reallly good. Characters like Inosuke, Shinobu and Kanao are some of my favorites. Inosuke for being a clueless demon slayer, is one of the characters that developed the most. He tries to understand everything with just force but that because he is ignorant to the things around him. Then characters like Shinobu and Kanao being these mysterious characters that try to hide everything through their smiles but that at the same time are just suffering though hiding their true feelings were done really well. If I talked about every single character in this show that would be take a lot of time, but all I can say is that the characters in this show are so diverse that you can find your favorite without problem.
The production of this show is top notch. The soundtrack is one of the best. The orchestral soundtrack and the traditional japanese music is simply a bless to hear and adds a lot to the battles and dark atmosphere of the demons. The voice actors do their job fine except for the blondie because as he would say: HE IS TOO DAMN ANNOYING DID YOU GET THAT USER THAT READS THIS?? I had to mute him sometimes because he can give you a headache in no time. 
The Opening is really good, with the interpretation of Lisa to get you hooked with the series and the ending is good but not something I would let play after each episode.
The artstyle is good but something that bothered me a lot was when they made transtitions into funny situations. For some reason it looks so out of place and that doesn't belong to the proper series. Also the other expressions look limited with this emote (._.) appearing most of the time. If they have done different expressions like the way they do it with the Fate Series it would have blend really well, instead of this weird amalgamation they did here with the artsyle changing.
The use of CGI is Top Notch. Ufotable really knows how to blend 3D and 2D very well and watching any action scene from their shows can cure anyone if you have watched other anime that don't do this well at all. 
In the end this show could have gotten a 9 or a 10 from me if it had stayed with the serious atmosphere and doing the pacing correctly instead of throwing these moments in a very forced way. Because Kimetsu no Yaiba excells a lot with the action, music and animation. Maybe I will watch the sequel of this but for now it was just a passable show to watch and not really into it to watch or read more.

                Such a shame, amazing animation. Looks absolutely stunning. The characters are so annoying though. The protagonist Tanjiro, is great. However, all the side characters are horrible. The story is very boring. I dropped this anime twice and i forced myself to finish it and i was just disappointed. So much hype for this anime but it was a massive let down, probably the worst anime I've seen. The only good episode was episode 19, it was entertaining, but after that it went back to boring.

                Okay, some people may say that this anime is only nice because of its drawing. I don't think so. I really loved this anime! I watched it for the second time only one week after I finished it the first time. The first time I watched it I finished it in 2 days, and the second time, 1 day. It truly loved it. The storyline, and drawings. The storyline is super nice! How he has to fight demons and protect his sister and everything, the drawings just make it even nicer. It shows the scenes perfectly and that's why I love it. Demon Slayer overall
                  is a superior anime too me because the story and the drawings perfectly fit together creating this masterpiece. I really cannot wait for season 2 or/and the Arc Train (a movie I think). If you are someone who wants to watch it but is unsure, I recommend u too but u shud watch it only when the whole thing comes out. As waiting for a good anime's second season/episode is hard. I forgot what else I wanted to say... but to me, this anime is the best one I've seen so far... and I hope it stays like that. :]",10,Sabito_Lover

                History-4/10
There is nothing new here. Protagonist who had his whole family murdered, needs to get from A to B to defeat and save someone, and so follows that whole script ready for the hero's journey. What compromised the note is the fact that there are precedents (other animes) that take all the elements that Kimetsu no Yaiba proposes, and work in a much better and cohesive way than he himself. The construction of universe and society is very weak, containing a limited collection of information about the limited past and culture of the Demon Slayer universe.
Art-10/10
After Ufotable got sick of animating the inexpressive Fate series,
                  she decided to work with the adaptation of the Demon Slayer manga. Ufotable is known for being, today, one of the best Japanese animation studios, whose work is, most of the time, impeccable, resulting in a visually fluid, beautiful and clear animation. Along with this, the studio used Nihonga (Japanese art), which reminds me of woodcuts, to increase the fight scenes and elements (fire, water, thunder, etc.), which did not damage the animation at all and added originality to the art of Demon Slayer. In addition, it also contributes narratively as it changes to adapt to the most comical, neutral and serious scenes.
Sound / Soundtrack-7
Demon Slayer is an audiovisual work. The audio alone would be ruined by these horrible dialogues, but luckily it was saved by sound engineering and the studio that had the technical job of making a soundtrack, not excellent, but good enough to fuse the viewer's mind with the setting and to the fight scenes. As with the artistic issue, the soundtrack draws on ancient Japanese styles and authenticates Kimetsu no Yaiba's sound identity. From what I read, this work also had a little finger from Yuki Kajiura, who has saved a lot of bad animes (like Sword Art Online and Fate / Zero) just composing their soundtrack.
Characters-3
Demon Slayer is an anime that uses several archetypes to create its characters. It is as if the author had gone to a shelf and picked up the archetype that pleased her the most, and gave them a name, for example: the archetype of the good boy and the vigilante, this one will be called Tanjirou, and the one there, the archetype of the dumb will be called Zenitsu, and that's how she created the characters. This only demonstrates the laziness in creating something original. All the characters are poorly developed, the comic reliefs that enter a certain moment in history take the heavy atmosphere out of the anime alone, only serve to make noise and slow down the rhythm of the anime. The villain, who is such an important element, doesn't frighten anyone, has generic motivations, and it only gets worse when you continue the story reading the manga, but here I am specifically evaluating the anime. The protagonist is a joke and sickening to watch. Kimetsu no Yaiba has weak, poorly developed characters, and you will often be caught hoping that the demons will soon kill the quartet of protagonists for being too boring.
Conclusion
Demon Slayer is a mediocre anime, ruined by the script and saved by the technical qualities of the direction.

                Oh, Demon Slayer. How I wish I liked you more than I do. You're one of the most popular new shounen anime to come out in recent years, and one of few shows that's actually deserving of its popularity in some ways. Demon Slayer seems to have it all: Great characters, a compelling story, luscious animation, epic music, and a dark atmosphere unheard of in most shounen shows. Everybody loved it, and it became a huge hit, even after its source manga officially ended not too long ago. It was even popular enough to air on Toonami! However, having seen it myself...I'm not gonna lie,
                  Demon Slayer as a series has been an incredibly frustrating series for me. Not because it's bad, oh no. It's actually really good, and I feel its popularity is definitely justified and well deserved, something I can't say for a lot of mainstream anime I've seen...and yet, for all of the show's good qualities, its flaws are so huge that they really stand out. Like, a 200-pound tumor on a small human level of standing out. Ugh. This is not gonna be pretty.
Anyway, in the Taisho period of Japan, demons roam the streets during the night, killing people and feasting on their blood, having done so for centuries. In order to eliminate these vicious monsters, a special group of elite warriors called the Demon Slayer Corps was formed to at least try to curb the threat, with varying levels of success. In a far off village, Tanjiro Kamado is a young boy who works hard to help his family, selling charcoal in town to make ends meet. But one night, he comes home to find his entire family massacred...except for one of his sisters, Nezuko. A demon killed his entire family, and that same demon turned Nezuko into a demon. When a passing demon slayer attempts to kill Nezuko, Tanjiro manages to get through to both him and Nezuko, with the latter displaying more humanity than is considered normal for a demon. The passing demon slayer, Giyu, suggests that Tanjiro join the Demon Slayer Corps so he can have some chance of finding the demon responsible for killing his family and maybe find a way to change Nezuko back into a human. And thus, with Nezuko by his side, Tanjiro is determined to do whatever it takes to become a demon slayer.
Now, I have not read the original manga, so any comments and opinions I have are solely aimed towards the anime adaptation. But before I get to my gripes with the show, I'm going to start with the good parts. For one, the animation is stellar. Not as stellar as other shows I've seen, and it has its hiccups and bad CGI, but when Ufotable really want to show off their animation skills, they really go all out. From the stylized water that appears when Tanjiro fights a demon to the barrage of colorful flowers and sparkles when one demon makes another one go on an acid trip on purpose, to the actual fight scenes, Ufotable really knows when to go all out when they want to. They make great use of lighting and special effects to make for some beautiful shots, and even their simpler frames always have some interesting animation. Unfortunately, the CGI is where it gets tricky. The CGI used for various environments is fine at times, but for some reason, Ufotable had some of the characters go into CG at times, like in shots where they're far away or trying to dodge fast attacks. It doesn't help that the transition from 2D to CGI is about as seamless as a very bumpy brick road. Seriously, who thought this was a good idea? But the best part of the show is the music, bar none. Some may feel Yuki Kajiura has lost her touch over the years, but here she really brought her A game, full of high pitched flutes, echoing strings, haunting vocals, and epic instrumentation, both she and Go Shiina made a bitchin' OST that absolutely elevates the show to new heights. I never had a problem with its soundtrack at all, so kudos to you guys.
Unfortunately, this is where I start to get...critical. Now please, don't get me wrong, I WANT to like this series. I really do! It has so much that I could ever want in a show! Hell, its first ten episodes are some of the best the show has to offer. They immediately offered engaging characters, strong writing, a dark atmosphere that fits the tone that the show established from the beginning, and a commitment to actually showing characters working hard and actually growing as people rather than relying on stock archetypes that blaze through everything with the power of friendship. However, it's AFTER those ten episodes are finished that the show seems to lose its footing in terms of overall direction and writing, like it wants to add in new elements but those new elements feel so jarring and out of place that they just do not mix well with what Demon Slayer already established. For example, really random, zany, over-the-top comedy is repeatedly interspersed with the darker, serious moments, and they honestly have no business being there. There's an art to knowing when to be funny and when to be serious. But if you can't commit to a certain atmosphere, don't try to mix two wildly different tones together, especially when they don't mix well at all!
This also extends to the characters. The anime seems to believe that the characters won't be memorable if it doesn't absolutely BLAST you with the basest aspects of their personality at the highest extreme possible from the very start and continuing to do so afterward. Granted, the lead characters gradually develop past their base archetypes (Tanjiro and Inosuke being the best examples of this), but many of the side characters suffer from their base personality trait being exaggerated to ridiculous degrees, and this can be real annoying, real fast. Demon Slayer unfortunately doesn't really seem to know how to tone things down or strike a delicate balance between its wildly different tones, and because of this, any attempts at character development or any kind of serious drama lose their impact because of its random switches between tones.
All of these problems come from one source, the biggest detriment to the show as a whole: Zenitsu.
Yes, everything wrong with Demon Slayer's second half all boils down to Zenitsu Agatsuma. Seriously, this kid is the amalgamation of ALL of Demon Slayer's flaws. He's little more than a whiny little bitch baby who does nothing but bitch and moan and scream and whine like nobody's business, and he does this CONSTANTLY!! Granted, he's not as bad as other characters in other anime I've seen, but his entire presence seems to completely go against everything the show already set up at the start. It doesn't help that whenever Zenitsu appears, the writing takes a huge nosedive because instead of actually bothering to develop Zenitsu and have him grow out of being a whiny bitch baby who runs at the slightest peril, it seems to actively bend over backwards just to have him conveniently do things that go against the show's established rules just to keep him as a coward. For one, his fighting style is complete bullshit: He's somehow ONLY able to fight when he's unconscious, and even after having done so, he often wakes up with no memory of having fought at all! His whole fighting style just reads like an excuse to have Zenitsu conveniently do cool stuff without bothering to actually have him grow a pair and, y'know, ACTUALLY put in effort to make him into more than a pile of screaming madness, thereby killing whatever tension any dramatic scene Zenitsu's in has! The reason Tanjiro's usage of his fighting style works (Most of the time) is because the show bothered to actually show him training and putting in effort to become a Demon Slayer, so his knowing the techniques and putting them to use doesn't come out of the left field, and he doesn't just magically become good at fighting at the drop of a hat. Also, no, Demon Slayer, being struck by lightning does not change a person's hair color. It feels like Zenitsu belongs in a completely different show, or like a different set of writers come on board when it's time for him to appear, and considering how much of a spineless little bitch baby he is, I have to wonder how he's even able to function in the world. I can definitely see why people hate this kid so much. I don't HATE him per se, but dear lord, show, PLEASE tone him down!
Granted, not every flaw Demon Slayer has is solely because of Zenitsu. Even before he appears, sometimes the show makes some decisions that make little to no logical sense. For one, it gets established that Tanjiro breaks several bones in his body when fighting demons. Normally, when that happens, one would be completely incapacitated depending on how severe the injury is, needing a few weeks to a few months to completely heal. However, in Demon Slayer, Tanjiro is apparently still able to move after two days, even with several broken bones! This is not how human bodies work! Dear lord, this is the thing with Demon Slayer: for every great point it has, it always winds up having a huge flaw that brings it down.
Nevertheless, I can wholeheartedly recommend Demon Slayer for those looking for a shounen series that isn't Naruto, Black Clover, Fairy Tail, and so on. Good shows like this one are very rare, especially since most shounen shows often feel like a plain ol' rehash or rip-off of an existing premise or formula without trying to establish their own identity. It helps that the manga concluded, so Demon Slayer already gets points for not dragging itself out longer than it needs, nor does it need to worry about overstaying its welcome. Demon Slayer, while too wildly inconsistent for its own good at times, is a breath of fresh air in an oversaturated genre, and considering I tend not to like mainstream anime for a variety of reasons, I mean it when I say it absolutely deserves its popularity.",7,Firechick12012

Update: Well, this anime just shot the praise I gave it in the foot about not having over reactionary characters, ignore the bit where I credit it for that.
I figured since the first cour was almost over, its time for a review.
Story: 7 out of 10 Its your run of the mill shonen, typical shonen aspects, but its not done in an annoying way and is actually quite enjoyable for the most part, action scenes are stunning, as to be expected of
                  UFOtable. The characters done here can be found anywhere else personality wise, but they are extremely fun regardless.
Art: 9 out of 10, main reason I dont give this a solid 10 out of 10 is cause of the cgi models used in walking scenes on important characters like Tanjiro, taking you out of the moment.
Sound: 8 out of 10, pretty solid but some osts do feel a bit re used too much.
Characters: 7 out of 10, like I addressed in the story segment of the review,  the characters are not written in a way to where they stick out amongst the shonen crowd, but they are still enjoyable none the less.
Enjoyment: 8 out of 10, the action scenes and suspense scenes, along with some of the training moments are done really well. Also, the characters personalities, while not too original, are enjoyable because they're not over the top annoying with them like in other Shonen.
Over all score: 9 out of 10. Kimetsu is a fun watch if you're not looking for a deep story (as of this moment in the anime, judging based on my anime only experience.) It has fun action, likable characters, and so far, an interesting main villain. Definitely watch it as a chill anime to enjoy and have fun with.",9,Weebover9000

Being Fairly honest, this Anime is a Masterpiece, but it has some Deus Ex Machina, and i don't like that, overall it is a great anime.

The art is quite unique too.

                So I have recently returned from my anime hiatus and I've been catching up with all the stuff I've missed in the last 2 years. Demon Slayer is sooooooooo good, no-one can tell me otherwise and if you gave this series less than a 6 rating then I don't think we watched the same show. I don't make the rules. 
I'm going to start with the music which is probably one of my favourite parts of the show. The opening is by LiSA. Do I really need to say anymore? Every opening she has ever done has me so hyped and Gurenge is no exception.
                  The punk rock, borderline metal vibe of the opening really sets up the atmosphere for the show perfectly and the visuals were beautiful too. 
Which brings me onto art! Now I really enjoy the character designs. You can figure out most characters' attributes pretty easily and the designs were fun to look at (I don't know if that makes sense). The animation is good too. I will be honest I don't usually vibe with CGI in anime BUT it worked well in Demon Slayer so it'll be an exception. The colours were vibrant too! 
The story was absolutely brilliant (again I don't make the rules). I was captivated right off the bat from episode one and there was never a dull moment. The balance between the storyline and the fight scenes was great in my opinion. I grew attached to characters so quickly because they were so human, even the demons. The humorous moments were lovely too and I laughed each time. 
Overall I recommend giving Kimetsu no Yaiba a shot. Of course because I enjoyed so much I'll preach about how amazing it was for me but I genuinely believe that whether you're interested in action or an adventurous plot, you'll get it here!",9,Its_pumpkin

                The animation is perfect and the soundtrack is very good, that's a fact. But that's it.
The story is weak and completely cliché and the development of the characters simply does not exist, the narrative comes down to the protagonist, Tanjiro, finding a very strong enemy and taking power from the ass to win.
It's an extremely overrated anime, and it's far from the best anime of 2019
However, because of the beautiful animation, it is a fun anime to watch, you even forget that it is terrible, if you want something simple to watch, without worrying if it is bad or not, it is worth it

                [Spoiler Warning]
So, this is one of those animes that does some things really well, but does other things terribly. So to start off with the good. The art, the art is some of the best you'll see, everything looks super clean, especially in fights. There are some interesting characters like Inosuke, Tomioka, and Shinobu. And there are some pretty interesting fights such as when they enter into a demon's house, and realise he can control it like a rubix cube. 
So, the bad, and my god there's a lot of it. Characters, many of them are completely stuck into their gimmick in every scene. Yes,
                  many characters get a gimmick, and it's their only feature it seems. Zenitsu's is that he's the screaming coward, so in almost every single scene, he's screaming about ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. It really made me hate him the more he was on the screen, just bloody yelling non-stop. Then in the last few episodes we meet a guy with an empathy/crying gimmick, so guess what? He's crying every time he has lines. We meet another guy who constantly says ""flamboyantly"" so, he just says it, all the time, out of context or not, just every sentence he fits in, ""flamboyantly"". We have another guy whose gimmick is to be not paying attention, this guy feels like a rip-off on the comedy of Gintama when characters don't pay attention during dialogue, but they've done it pretty badly and none of it's funny. We have some girl who constantly thinks everything is cute/cool, so during dialogue they constantly cut to her just so she can think to herself ""they look so cute/cool!"", it adds nothing at all.
Another big issue with KnY is the way they portray characters, as well as the gimmicks. The main character has his whole family slaughtered in the first episode, but it seems like he's a sociopath, because he acts shocked for about all of 20 seconds before returning to his normal self. It's such a cheap way to build a character, to kill off almost their entire family, and have it mean almost nothing to the character beyond him intermittently saying ""the bad guys killed my family!"" when they want to remind the audience of why you should care about him. The second main character who's the only other person that's in every episode, Nezuko, is essentially a dog. She has no dialogue, which makes no sense as other demons can speak? (Also don't understand why she has to wear a muzzle) She randomly fights sometimes but then is written to be sleeping every other time (not weak storytelling at all), and people talk about her like she's a pet most of the time.
As a small note, they need to stop with the cliche of ""we're going to have a conversation in the middle of a fight, and the enemy will move at 1 tenth of their usual speed until we finish talking, or better yet, they won't move at all and just stare at us talking the entire time"".
This is one of those anime, that I genuinely don't understand how it's so popular. I think there's a lot of potential for it to get pretty good next season/movie, but they have got to let up on spamming these gimmicked characters who offer nothing beyond their catchphrase/signature. Also, as a side-note, they need to work on the comedy, because it's really not funny at all, and sometimes they try to make jokes in what they want you to believe is a serious situation.
Oh, and I forgot another thing they love to do. Every time the bad guy is killed they give them flashbacks of someone being mean to them, that is stupid as shit. Why should we feel bad for someone who has eaten humans, just because someone said that their writing sucked, and that they're a loser?",5,Dance-Seth-Dance

                Very well written story and characters, was really impressed by how much character development they could fit in such a short amount of time, even demons who only appear for a couple of episodes have a backstory
Watching it felt like watching 2 complete opposite stories at the same time, on one hand, you have a sweet and heroic story of a brother who just wants to protect and save his sister, on the other we have that of the demons, of what really goes on behind the scenes, where demons actually live in fear of a bigger, more powerfull demon, these 2 opposites mashed toghether,
                  and somehow it works!

                A simple story isn't inherently a bad story. 
Kimetsu no Yaiba is a phenomenal anime, but ever since Episode 19 went viral on Twitter, people have been criticizing it for it's story. 
Kimetsu no Yaiba does indeed have a simple story, but it never pretends to be a complex story. Koyoharu Gotouge never tries to over-complicate it, the story is perfectly simple, straight forward, and at the same time, brilliant. 
Similar to Dororo, its simplicity isn't to be critiqued, as it is intended to be a simple and straight forward narrative. Instead, critique it as entertainment, as a piece of art, as a show. 
Objectively
                  Kimetsu no Yaiba is fantastic. The animation is beautiful, the characters are perfectly simple, the worldbuilding is good, the magic system is decent. The sound design is incredible, the pacing is incredible.. There's a lot to love about this show, and very little to hate. 
Haruo Sotozaki, the director, did a fantastic job creating nuance in scenes that felt empty in the manga. Personally, I believe this is one case where the anime exceeds the manga in quality. Haruo Sotozaki added context to scenes and battles that lacked such context in the manga. 
Also, mad credit to Yuki Kajiura and Go Shiina for composing such a beautiful soundtrack.",9,Skoff
38000,"
                ""Nezuko-chaaaan!""
Kimetsu no Yaiba is the result of grand but meticulous animation mixed with polished writing and overall craftsmanship that nearly culminates into the quality of what I consider to be a masterwork of an anime. 
This anime seems to have really hit the community from two angles - some perceive it as a flashy show with a high budget spent on mediocre to poor source material and plot - and others view it as a well-developed piece of work with simply great story design that is complimented from its excellent execution. 
I fall into the ladder category.
The story setting and dramatic themes are cultivated into
                  an atmosphere of a tense, serious, and emotionally driven storyline from the beginning of the anime. 
From the start, there is no filler, and no time wasted on building unnecessary attachments to characters as a cheap way to create a sensational drive within the viewer - Kimetsu no Yaiba is honest with its plot and doesn't beat around the bush. This provides the story with the right amount of momentum from the start - it prevents any awkward plot shifts and changes in theme - and allows the viewer to be fully engaged. Nobody likes excessive melodrama, and neither do the writers of Kimetsu no Yaiba. 
However, it is this lack of immediate forced tear-jerker that allows for true dramatization and emotional attachment. 
The vast setting and landscape of Kimetsu no Yaiba coupled with the direct and streamlined approach to the story creates an immediately intriguing world. The characters are not designed to be instantly relatable, or loveable. They are designed to be themselves - and to stick to specific character design. However, this does not translate to simplicity, but integrity. Our characters' maintained dispositions are what, over time, make them likable, authentic, and entertaining. Put simply, they are not just concepts or plot elements, but true personalities within the environment; they react how they are meant to react, and that makes them wholly believable and fun characters.
It is then this set-in-stone, established settings and characters that make the show so precious when they grow. 
Kimetsu no Yaiba's shining trio Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke are three of the main characters of the anime and have the biggest personalities within the smallest package - rich, with no filler. Not only do they provide cunning humor, but they are each valuable elements of the show, and display the nature of the show's universe in their own way. 
Tanjiro, the lead protagonist, is considerate, moral, and driven through his desire to go back to his past life - to what was. Not only does this spark great colors against the show's setting of uncompromising brutality and unethical world, but it gives the plot a sense of greater purpose. With morals driving the intentions of our protagonist, it makes us wish to rally with his goals. 
Next, Zenitsu is a cry-baby, insecure, annoying, yet budding character who fails at nearly everything - he has no achievements, no impressive virtues, and no future - at least, that's what he thinks. Zenitsu vies for a better life - to just get at what could be. However, his failure to recognize his own potential causes him to shudder at every opportunity for greatness, and resort to a simple desire for a happy future - often through means of a girl. While these pursuits are charming in their own right - as they represent his motivation and desire for his dreams - they will not allow Zenitsu to grow personally. If he could manage to face his own current impotence, accept it, and attempt to persevere, he could achieve in his pursuit of happiness. 
Finally, Inosuke is the most straight-forward of the three; Inosuke is a boar boi with (almost) impeccable confidence and motivation - he doesn't wish to restore his past life or achieve a greater one - Inosuke's goal is to just be recognized for his current self. A recognition lacking throughout his childhood. Inosuke was abandoned as a child at a mountain, raised around boars, and never experienced empathy, affection, or respect. It's this stoic background that creates his lovability and tragedy.

                It's safe to say that Kimetsu no Yaiba has become an international sensation. It has gained immense popularity both in Japan and the West, and become one of the most popular new-generation shonen series, due to its outstanding animation and thrilling fights. And while Kimetsu no Yaiba has its merits, the first season suffered from a poor first half, salvaged only by the last 10 episodes.
Kimetsu no Yaiba's first couple of episodes were promising. They effectively introduced and characterized series protagonists, siblings Tanjiro and Nezuko Kamado, as well as interesting side characters such as Giyuu Tomioka. However, the following arcs, featuring the Kamado siblings' travels
                  across Taisho-era Japan, proved to be less entertaining. The demons themselves fell flat, with their tragic backstories failing to achieve sympathy. While the Kamado siblings are likable, they were unable to carry the show.
Things began to improve with the introduction of Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira. While their debut involved yet another boring minor antagonist and a substandard fight, the duo brought comedic elements to the show, along with new breathing styles that made the power system much more intricate and varied. The following episodes at Mount Natagumo improved the show more, with multiple riveting confrontations between our main characters and a family of powerful demons. These episodes were only enhanced by spectacular animation.
Rounding up the season, a chain of episodes at the Butterfly Mansion of Shinobu Kocho introduced a factor that the show was severely lacking: worldbuilding. Introduced to the hashira, and told about the structure of the Demon Slayer Corps, along with the stories of Kanae, Shinobu, and Kanao, the world of Kimetsu no Yaiba became more interesting and expansive.
While the second half of Kimetsu no Yaiba improved massively, there were still factors that could have been improved on, such as its side cast. While we were introduced to the 9 Hashira in the closing episodes, we were provided no background or information for any but the ones we were already familiar with, Giyuu and Shinobu. While in later seasons and arcs we got to know these characters, the first season only left us with a couple of lines from each, and a set of very broad self impressions. Also taking into consideration the cliffhanger that the season ends on, Kimetsu no Yaiba felt like it was slowly leading up to something only to make fans wait, unlike other series that started with a bang.
Kimetsu no Yaiba had a slow and poor start. And while it improved considerably, there were still aspects that weren't given enough attention, and areas for improvement. Areas that were touched upon in later seasons.",8,TheEvDog

                Okay, i'm gonna try to keep this short - this anime is straight up one of the BEST shonen series i've seen. It might look like your typical fighting anime and well - it is a fighting anime, but done damn right.
Story 10/10:
The story revolves around Kamado familly's oldest son selling charcoal- Tanjirou and about his sister - Nezuko. Both are living high in the mountains, selling charcoal to the local town down bellow the mountains. One day, after selling charcoal - Tanjirou stays at his ,,neighbour'' house because of the demons that comes out after the sun goes down. After waking up, he goes
                  to his house just to witness the tragedy - the brutal murder of his family. The only one alive was Nezuko that turned into a Demon but survived. Later on, Tanjirou wants to become a Demon Slayer to take the revenge on his familly, while also protecting his Demon sister. 
Art 10/10:
Art is AMAZING here. The specific ink-like lineart highlights the fact that this anime is placed in Edo period. The artitsts have no problem with anatomy and keeps everything nice and normal, while also making crazy demons designs even scarier that you would even think of. The eyes here are exteremly pretty, while also sometimes showing the tragic past of the character. The animation is clear and smooth, and oh boy the techniques are  briliantly animated, they have the same ink-like lineart but if we take Water Techniques for example - the Water acts like water, it falls, it splashes. 
Sound 10/10:
The sound is incredible. We don't have the bass-boosted sound effects like in some anime, we have clean sword sounds. Beautiful music such as OST's and op/ed are giving this anime the thing that most of the shounens nowadays lack. The voice-actors really did a great job - Tanjirou's screams,  Zenitsu being upset or Inosuke screaming rapidly were briliant!
Character 10/10:
Well, characters here are unique and great. 
Tanjirou is like your typical shounen character - always happy, wants to bring happiness to everyone's lifes but he's also really fragile (mentally and psychically) which makes him a resposinble older brother.
Nezuko - well, Nezuko is straight up badass but also adorable. She cares about her brother a lot, while also being a demon  which makes her unique while compared to other demons.
Zenitsu on the other hand, is a total opposite of Tanjirou - always scared, playboy and totally is not strong,but when he passes out.. Interesting things happen. 
We also have Inosuke and Giyuu.
Inosuke is a really rapid young man, who loves to slice up things, don't think much and wear his boar mask.
And Giyuu? Well, he's a mysterious man, so a lot hasn't been revealed now but already everyone loves him!
Enjoyment 10/10:
This anime sometimes makes you laugh, sometimes cry and that's really amazing about it.
Overall 10/10:
I reccomend this anime to EVERYONE who watched Naruto, because this anime literally made me cry many times, like Naruto did, which makes it the second most emotional anime on my list. The sword fights are god-like animated. Maybe this serie, would be the part of the Big Three.... who knows?",10,FukaseKun

                STORY-
Storywise this anime at first will look like a cliched out anime, with a similar story to many other series.but as you keep on going you see the world that is being built, the character interactions are really life-like.
ART- 
to be honest, I first started watching this series because of how its art style looked captivating to me and the studio Ufotable is doing a great job at it. the art is very smooth and the transition from 2d to CGI animation during some sequences is really beautiful.
SOUND-
the score of kimetsu no yaiba is really great as it is able to bring about the emotional
                  kick for some scenes perfectly. the voice actors are also really great. sometimes a few character's voices would seem annoying but it is how their character is written. the score is used with perfect timing and is dropped when not needed.
CHARACTER-
characters are well written in this anime, they all have different personalities, that includes the background characters. the comic relief scenes never felt forced because of the well-established characters.
ENJOYMENT-
this anime has a very captivating story which really enjoyable since it makes you want to read its manga, which I say is very enjoyable in itself.it also shows how the show is so enjoyable that you would want to read the manga.
OVERALL- 
I don't have any complaints with the anime as I was able to have a good time but there are also a few things I would have liked if the would have happened differently.thats why I only give it 9/10.",9,deathking118

                Demon Slayer: Kimestu no Yaiba is a typical shounen. It dutifully follows the formula 
[lead + troubled past + hard work*determination = warrior who will exceed expectations],
which, in itself, is fine. However, when the characters lack depth, the story is too predictable, and developments in either have no explanation, it becomes problematic.
Before getting to the meat of this review, the art and graphics must definitely be commended. Personally, I'm not a fan of the character style, but the effort and details put into the animation, most especially every fight, were awesome. Action scenes were very dynamic and great, with every breathing technique, cut, or slash.
                  Likewise, the backgrounds were unquestionably something to behold.
Unfortunately, beautifully-made clips do not compensate for a lack of proper story telling and plot. 
Please do note that there are some SPOILERS present throughout this review. They are not too important on how the tale unfolds, but are there to illustrate some points.
As mentioned, the anime has all ingredients that would fit the young boy genre: there's the main character, Tanjiro, whose family was massacred, save his sister, Nezuko, who was turned into a man-eating demon. He then becomes a Demon Slayer to protect/save his sibling and avenge his family. The overall plot is fine, but the predictability and troublesome narration were already apparent at the very start. 
When it began with Tanjiro running through the snow with his bloodied sister on piggyback, those watching would already know that there was unrest. Then comes a flashback of his happy family - smiles and hugs, yay! The MC has to travel far to the town to earn money for supper. As he departed, his voice over goes, ""But life could change suddenly like the weather... and whenever happiness is destroyed, there's always the smell of blood."" W-O-W. This could be somewhat excusable. Fine, the writers want to emphasize that something will go wrong (even when viewers already know that). However, whilst Tanjiro returns to his home, he again utters, ""whenever happiness is destroyed, there's always the smell of blood."" And surprise, all suspense and impact gone, he finds his family dead. This is an example the kind of story telling is evident throughout the whole series. 
The characters could have been fairly interesting. There are a variety of quirky personalities that have the potential to stir up the plot, which can hopefully be done in the upcoming movie or season. 
Based on who were most recently introduced, the audience has to consider the likes of the lead. Tanjiro is the eldest and breadwinner of a paternally orphaned family. Having to be accountable for 6 other mouths, he is straightforward, has a high sense of responsibility and diligence. What sets him apart is his unadulterated kindness and his superior sense of smell. Tanjiro is fairly likable, though many other MCs have similar characteristics. While it is difficult to empathize that he lost his family because of how the scene unfolded, one can still invest in the idea of his being hardworking towards his goals. 
As fate would have it, he is steered to a Demon Slayer trainer and undergoes life-on-the-line exercises. During which, the ""Total Concentration Breathing Technique"" is mentioned very briefly. Emphasis is made on how he improved sitting under a waterfall, as well as going up and down a mountain without dying. Later on, during the Final Selection (Demon Slayer exam), we find out all of a sudden that he is a master of the breathing technique and that water spews out while he does this. Again, the animation for this is breathtaking, but does not satisfy the lingering inquiry on how his expertise and technique came about. This is one of the inexplicable instances that did not allow the audience to fully appreciate developments in character and plot.
Nevertheless, kudos must be given to the fact that villains are given backstories. It helps the viewers relate more to the experiences of the characters. It's easier to empathize with Tanjiro's kindness and with the feelings of the demons.  
It was a combination of overlapping inconsistencies, predictabilities, and magical happenings (no explanations given) that curtailed the entertainment of the show. On a random note, something that could be deemed enjoyable was the use of traditional Japanese items, like the temari and the tsuzumi as weapons. These are such small details that need to be pointed out to increase its likability.
Overall, Kimestu no Yaiba was just okay, nothing new, really.",6,Hyouron

	While I am writing this I have still a lot of various feelings. And I'm thinking that it's one of the most important advantage.

Even though their life is though they are full of positive energy and love each other. Tanjirou is responsible young boy who had to take over father's duties cause of his death. One night unexpected tragedy comes to them. When Tanjirou is outside the home his family is slaughtered by demon. Only his younger sister Nezuko survives. But she is turned into demon. Although the situation is terrible they still have hope. Because of her resilient mental strength, Nezuko has not lost her human emotions. In spite of that she is a demon Nezuko can stop from eating humans. Tanjirou promises to himself that no matter what he returns his little sister's humanity. This is Tanjirou's main purpose. To achieve that Tanjirou joins to Demon Slaying Corps. He has kind and cheerful personality despite of fact that he's lost his family. That shows how he is strong.  He values family bonds so much that there's no doubt in order to protect Nezuko he'll sacrifice even own life. She is the whole world to him. This is the most powerful driving force I've ever seen. Because of that he has giant perseverance. He will never give up. We can see such moments watching the series. That's why he is so endearing character.
	After joining to Demon Slaying Corps he continues journey according to orders from superiors. During the travel he meets two ""nakama"". They are like him Demon Slayers. In both cases at first glance we see two odd people who behave unusual. First one is Zenitsu Agatsuma. Young boy who cries like a baby because he is afraid of everything what is normal for his profession. And second one is Inosuke Hashibira. Here we have a climax of human quirk. Trust me. Both in character and look he is different than anybody. For example he wears boar mask and pants that look like fur. He is easy to manipulate and always wants  to compete with Tanjirou. He says then ""Everything you can do I can do it too!""  They play like the most typical shonen characters but still make on me a great impression. Probably because everything is well-balanced. We have amusing moments and dead serious moments, we can count on them when we need it the most, a well-know story line. All of these characters and situations create a coherent logical plot. 
	After incident on Nagatuma Mountain Tanjirou is put on trial and then he meets in person The Pillars also known as Hashira. Who they are? So, they are top-ranked swordsmen among Demon Slayers. To fight with demons they mastered perfectly a breath style through extreme training. In spite of this it's a bunch of intriguing individuals who have two common features. They are extremely dangerous and powerful and they have any mercy for demons no matter they have to deal with normal demon or demon in child's body. This last thing stays opposite to Tanjirou in some sense. Because he is type of empathic person.  It's obvious that he will kill all demons on his way but he is aware of their previous human lives.  He can notice their tragedy even though they devour people and to top it all of Tanjiro's family was killed by demons. He can still perceive their painful lives. 
[Breath Style& Animation]
      I'm gonna to describe my feelings about the visual part of Kimetsu no Yaiba.  At first I would like to share with you some information concern Breath Style and of course fights. Let's face fact. Average human is only a food for demons. He can only escape but honestly speaking it's impossible. So, how to battle with them? It's only one possibility, by using Breathe Style. Breath Styles are swordsmanship styles. They are capable of making their users fight on par with demons, and are generally used with Nichirin Blade swords to slay demons.
     This series is well animated. From the detail on each individual kimono to beautiful vintage Japanese landscapes in background.  And it's not just about the quality of the animation which is high. For instance characters' faces portray emotions perfectly. You don't have any problem to recognize them. In this point rather I would like to focus on fights. During the fight just before final hit we can see a slow motion and after that there is an overwhelming blow with full speed that brings a victory. Whenever I've seen it, it's always incredible. Scenes when someone is preparing for his attack are also amazing. We can see then characteristic steam comes out of the mouth after the person takes a breath. Then he whispers an incantation and now it's magic. His vibes changes completely and atmosphere becomes tense and you are aware of it that in a moment you will see a piece of good action.  It's not everything. All battle scenes are characterized by great camera work. There are close-up and dynamic camera angles that ensure you fillings how strong the blow was. Every time that makes me goose bumps. 
[Music]
      I always pay attention to music but I have not disliked any series because of music yet. Music causes strong feelings so without great music it's hard to make a great show. I think that some scenes may lose its own impact when the sound track not matches to them.  So music is essential part of anime. Here we can find a bit of emotional music. For example Kanjiro no Uta or Nezuko Theme that completely change my perspective. Even though these are sad tracks it's indispensable part of anime. Thanks to them you can feel much better the situation in which characters are. Main Theme is traditional Japanese style music that brings specific mood. And opening is great. I have prove of it. I didn't skip it at all. Because I am type of person who rather skip this part of each episode. But not in this case. 
[Summary]
If you want to know how good can be a well executed shonen you should watch this. For me Kimetsu no Yaiba is great show that ensures you various emotions and after watching first series you will need more.",9,Ikatteiruhito

                Just because it borrows tropes from every other shonen there is and has a pretty standard story doesn't make it bad. 
Ufotable is one of the best anime studios out there right now, pretty much everything they've ever made is incredible! Everything from the fate series to this. The plot is pretty average but that doesn't make it bad by any means, the characters for the most part are likable and well-written safe for some (Zenitsu), and the animation is superb. Although the animation in the fate series is better in my opinion. That aside, it's still a well-written enjoyable anime.

                To sum it all up, yes the show is overhyped.
The writing is hilariously bad, immature, and the MC has to be one of the most annoyingly stupid characters in all of anime. He also doesn't stfu during the fights, thus ruining what could be epic fight scenes. Here is your typical fight scene:
Tanjiro attacks with sword
Attack misses
Tanjiro: ""Darn! My 9th configuration water wheel katsumizu failed to connect. Darn! I need to focus. Wait... Where is Nezuko! Darn! How could I leave her alone! I'm so useless and I failed as a big brother. No wait. Nezuko is a demon, she can handle herself just fine!
                  
Nezuko comes in and kicks antagonist.
Tanjiro: ""That's right! Nezuko is a demon. I knew it! She is strong and capable the same way I am!""
Nezuko gets scratched.
Tanjiro: ""No! Darn! She was hurt because I was too weak to protect her. Too weak to protect everyone! I'm so useless. Wait... I need to remember my training. *45 second flashback reminding viewers something that was said just last episode* I just need to focus on my final attack... *30 sec breathing animation totally not thrown in as filler* 7th configuration waterfall takoyaki!""
Chops head off antagonist
Fight is over. 
Everyone hugs each other.
Nezuko does something cute as she crawls into box.
Tanjiro smiles and waives as the sun rises and background characters come to groundbreaking realizations like ""was that really a demon???"" after they were nearly killed by a a red eyed veiny dark monster that came out of the walls.
Wash-rinse-repeat. 
Credit where it's due though, Nezuko rules, and the animation is nice in some parts (laughably bad in others). Also episode 19 is overrated and very much cheap deus es machina, but that is some truly incredible animation.",5,DyingBloodbirds

                I am fairly new to anime and this was my second anime. It instantly became my favorite because of the main character's bond with his family (most especially with his sister), I find it adorable. The graphics and visuals are awesome. The characters are so lovable. Each episode had me hooked and made me want to keep watching. Every episode never failed to give me a reaction. I think this anime could be finished all in one day if anyone really wanted to. I finished it in a day because I was so hooked to it. I would highly recommend this anime to anyone.

                This season had three animus, each having the potential to last in our memories as good anime; namely: kimetsu no yaiba, enen no shobotai and dr stone. While i am immensely delighted that this season is not a total bust, i am quite upset that kimetsu no yaiba has already finished airing and i cant for the life of me remember how fast 26 episodes can end in a matter of two days for me. That is how good watching kimetsu no yaiba had been. 
Many who watched would have multiple reasons of his own but for me the deciding episode was Ep:4, when Muzan
                  Kibutsuji was first introduced. i cant believe that i watched a whole show stupidly waiting episode after episode in the hopes of a few minutes of screen time for this guy. 
To be honest, all shounen manga adaptations are governed by some major tropes, each of which help build a character with traits that help him or her fulfill the role of a Hero. I was no new comer to the omnipresent nakama obsession or the infamous sibling rivalries or the never ending pursuit of a big dream or the incessantly reminding readers of the MC's parental love or lack there of- dead or alive or most importantly the seemingly plain and powerless Mc being backed by latent superpower that rivals that of truly experienced side characters. No shounen manga/anime can or has withstood without these. I am pretty sure Tanjiro would surpass the likes of Tomioka, shinobu and all the remaining hashiras and not to mention their eerie master in no time.  It was that predictable. So kimetsu no yaiba was hardly anything i haven't already seen. 
The character art was lovely indeed, Muzen kibutsuji being the most beautiful character drawing and the rest of them with their occasional chibi faces were adorable too. Whenever nezuko turned small, i felt like scooping her up and protecting her. As for the story, lets say it had a near decent plot but the whole story telling was so slow that i thought like the animators were stalling for time. Between the brief recap of the previous week's episode before every subsequent week's episode and with both the Opening and Ending Ost, and of course, Zenitsu's loud and boisterous whining, you will have to make do with what little you get.  Just wish Muzan had more screen time. :D
Tanjiro checked all the boxes for an ideal shounen MC. He worked hard, had hidden talents which he cultivated in a very short span but somehow still remained super adorable. He was not completely dense and had a dead parent who may have been a powerful person too. Surprisingly, not only dead parents but he also had 4 siblings dead with only one sister who miraculously escaped death. Further he was determined to save nezuko and even carried her on his back wherever he went. If this does not spell sibling love then nothing does. Like a cherry on top he was as cantankerous as zenitsu or innosuke and super kind and friendly to even his sworn enemies.  He was like a guidance counselor you never had who couldn't hold himself from spreading his worldly thoughts on right and wrong. He was made out as a sympathiser and you are constantly left to wonder if the demons were good guys after all. (same feeling i had during tokyo ghoul- doves are bad, ghouls are good :P). This guy was the whole package, wanting nothing. If i looked deeper i couldn't find too many flaws in his character. I was kind of bored with the backstories of most of the side characters however short such scenes were. I wished i liked Zenitsu but he never gave me a reason. I am sure i liked Tomioka and would like to know a little bit more about him as i would for Mr Komada senior. I liked shinobu' voice, i felt like flowing water. I wanted to see more of the hashira's fighting especially against the juni kizuki. Both the juni kizuki and the hashiras had an aura of importance and intrigue surrounding them that it made me want to see their fighting scenes more than that of any scene or scenes involving the pointless so called comedy of the tanjiro-innosuke-zenitsu trio. It was labelled under action genre wasn't it? Had there been even a single episode wholly dedicated to Muzen kibutsuji, i would have been super elated. :P If the animators had incorporated some of these i think kimetsu could have been an even better story. 
Not saying i like this trend, whats with the 3d style fighting animation? kimetsu, fire force, arifureta and who knows how many. Its gonna take a while getting used to this kind animation. On the flip side, it has got a very good set of OST. Both the OP and ED are catchy and you will be humming the tunes once it gets inside of your head.
All these days i never valued any villain in any manga or anime as worthy not just because i have not seen than many anime, i have along way to go, it is just that no villain has made that kind of impression that he was awesome. The closest anyone came was izaya orihara. Kimetsu had also nearly failed me as i accidentally fell for Muzan's character design and somehow i end up squealing than give credit where its due. When he killed those five lower numbered demons, i was more attuned to how manly his voice was and how beautifully he was dressed as a woman. 
To sum it, the yawn worthy and morefully touch and go demon backstories; zenitsu's very existance; shinobu's eyes and finally the number of times tanjiro screamed nezuko's name were those parts that tested my patience while i trudged trough this otherwise fast paced show. No matter how many anime we watch, heart wrenching back stories that take of half of the episodes will haunt us forever. I am team""i have not read this manga and i did not know of its existence until now"". Perhaps the source material was not too big to cover two arcs i guess. None the less you cannot blame me for wanting to see more fun stuff happening.
In conclusion, kimetsu no yaiba is an amazing show to watch. Dont miss out on it just because it happens to be a generic shounen. 
Now for the more pressing issue. What should i do? What should i do? The show is over ;(",9,akirakishitani

                Outstanding anime, good animation, good story, good story pacing and story telling, good characters.  This is one of my favorite anime and I believe that it is very good, for the amount of episodes there are, I was in for a ride.  The only problem I had was the training arc because that did made me lose a bit of interest because it was boring but it felt like it was the only way that Tanjiro, Inosuke and Zenitzu was going to improve as a Demon Slayer Corp Member.

                After watching the 1st of ep of kny..it became quite clear to me...how much I already loved the plot..
It's simply outstanding anime outsmarting other smart animes with its plot nd animation..
FIRSTLY starting with the story..I would give a 9...nd it's not like I didn't like the story plot or anything...but the development of the story is quite clear just after 3 eps..anyone can tell what would happen next..quite anticipated plot ya know..no twist nd turns..no complexity..nothing...this is the reason y I'm giving a 9 score..the story is itself marvelous but lacks complexity..it's totally my pov..if u don't like complex stories like aot..then it's platinum for
                  ya..
Like in ep 1..the introduction (I personally love the intro section) is very abrupt..suddenly from nowhere a scarlet red hair boy is seen carrying an injured girl...but gradually u can see how he grows nd then fights the demons..to cure his demon sis..nd all that..after reaching ep 3...everything can be easily anticipated..this is my honest opinion.. 
SECONDLY...the art is mind blowing...amazing...cool..no word can describe it..I'm already updated with the manga part..but then also I'm watching the anime..only due to the art...it's utter beauty..so colorful..bright..everything..I'm in love with the art..
THIRDLY..comes the sound...I'm damn sure most of the otakus learn anime songs which they like (I myself have learned many)...now if one will like a song even if it's non anime..one will definitely download it...I'm challenging u..you'll get compelled to download the intro song(it somewhat reminded me of sao..the energy in the song..u can feel it) gurenge by Lisa.. And you'll learn it... like me..the moment I heard this intro song..I was in total love with it..nd i downloaded it the same moment...nd then it was like an infinite circle..from alarm to ring tone..everything one can think of.. So I give it a 10....with no doubts..no discussion..
FOURTHLY...I also give it a 10 here..cuz I loved the character development...nd yess by stating the character development I really MEAN IT..that KAMADO TANJIRO IS NO GAG CHARACTER..he has developed a lot upto now..nd it's a further growing character..his thirst for power to cure her younger sis Nezuko is very much convincing + emotional..I have cried many times during the show itself..
Tanjiro's ""AKIRAMENAIDE"" (never give up) is the best part..this is how a person should be in real life too..so it's very convincing again..nd then comes Nezuko's love for her onee chan....simply exploding..same goes for Tanjiro's love for Nezuko..overall all the characters sit perfectly at their places..whether be it Tomioka san or sabito..urokodaki san..all hashiras(pillars)...everyone..even the 12 demon moons too.. including their head muzan too...a perfectl villain..ingrossed with evilness..the repentance in every demon being killed floods with lots of emotions in the viewers' hearts..
FIFTH...I'll definitely give a 10 for enjoyment..it's already my one of the fav animes..nd you'll njoy it too.. I'm that much certain.. 
SIXTH..overall a 10...outstanding..
FINALLY...
I highly recommend this anime for sure..♥️",10,Amaterasu__

                The reason I like this kimetsu no yaiba is that it combines many things from my favorite animes. The main plot is kinda similar to many shounen animes. But the unique things about it is that it has no mistakes at all!
I can’t find any complaint about it. The character are all amazing they all have unique characters. Although, at first, character was similar to that of hinata and midoryia, but when you continue it you will see the difference. 
The story and characters are well developed. I like how they show what the characters went through in order to gain power/ become stronger. Specially
                  the main character tanjiro. The way they show their emotions during a fight, just makes it much better than the rest of the shounen animes I have watched.
It doesn’t have much fan service, os that makes it even better (I prefer anime that show less fan service, as I find them to have more serious plot, however that doesn’t mean anime with fan service don’t e.g fairy tail one of my best 
Animes)
To be honest at first I was hesitant to continue it, but what made me continue is tanjiro’s fun character, and of course his sister too (nezuko) the cutest girl in the whole anime. Not only that, but zenitsu’s and inosuke’s unique character and interactions are just hilarious. The relationship between the three (four including nezuko) main characters is so entertains I can’t get enough of them!!!  
I enjoyed kimetsu no yaiba so much, it made experience many emotions, sadness, happiness, pettiness, sympathy, joy, and many more I can’t use words to describe. I just love it!
I am soo glad I watched it because if I didn’t I would have never had the chance to enjoy my time and watch such a masterpiece  anime, and also read its manga.
(Btw the arcs in the manga are even better than the arcs now, they show great development of all characters)
I strongly recommend watching kimetsu no yaiba. (eading the manga too)

                A MASTERPIECE, is all what I can say about this anime. A must must must must (x infinity) watch for everyone. The animation, the soundtracks, the characters, the plot, every single thing is a work of art.
Honestly, I never thought I’d find an anime like what Naruto means to me but then I found this out of the blue after all these years. 
I’ll not get into a detailed review because I’m sure there are enough since it’s quite a popular show. 
I don’t know if it’s just me but the quality of Kimetsu can actually make me cry. It is that good. And yes
                  it may not be everyone’s cup of tea as is the case with everything.

                Review to self:
Overall Verdict:
I watched this anime for 9+ total episodes, the first 2 episodes were interesting, the next few where MC is forced to undergo intense training against a rock... typical plot progression elements. I really disliked the fact that our MC, Tanjiro fights an opponent - defeats them and then moves on to the next without any proper resolution to surrounding side characters etc. It is obvious this anime aims to document our MC and his sister in order to find the cure to change her back to human but it's extremely blatant that the series doesn't focus on detail apart from its
                  visual elements. My curious self, decided to read a few pages of the manga to ensure it was definitely delivering content worth investing in... I'd argue the manga is almost entirely better than the anime but I still didn't enjoy the less attention to character development... I will leave this unfinished until I deserve it is worth watching...",5,ST63LTH

                Right off the bat, I just want to say, this anime is one of the best I've watched so far! If you want something to dive into that has almost everything, from incredible artwork to an amazing story, then this is for you.
Kimetsu no Yaiba is pretty straight forward, it's right there in the title. The story unfolds right at the beginning of the anime by intensely immersing you in the world of Kimetsu no Yaiba. It progresses nicely and keeps you hooked and wanting more.
The artwork, as I already said, is incredible! This style has become one of my favorites especially that in my
                  opinion, it's executed perfectly with the use CGI and the alignment with amazing music.
Going to the characters, I almost fell in love of every character I've seen so far, the backstories, voice acting and overall feel of the character just gives you the feeling that you've known this specific character for a long time and gets you attached to it almost instantaneously.
This anime is not for the weakhearted though, it takes some patience and focusing on the bigger picture. As the story progresses, so do the characters and the knowledge of the overall plot. The voice acting in this anime is so great, its just relaxing to hear some of the characters just go on and on about anything, it's just so peaceful.
If you feel like watching an anime that combines a great story with amazing artwork and destructive fights, I highly recommend Kimetsu no Yaiba. I am looking forward for the movie and I just hope from the bottom of my heart that they don't delay it or take too much time with releasing it.
Thanks for reading this review, if you found this helpful, and feel like you have a similar taste in anime, don't hesitate to add me as I'm always looking for more friends with similar passion. Please do enjoy Kimetsu no Yaiba, I know I did!",9,ArcanamTredecim

                What really distinguishes Demon Slayer from other lesser anime series is the way this story is delivered. The early death scenes and the change in tone is dramatic (viewer discretion advised if you have kittens) but what is most memorable are the accompanying action scenes which does a really good job in keeping you clued to your seat. Not only is the action high octane stuff filled with suspense, emotion and angst what becomes abundantly clear from the get-go is the quality of animation. It is excellent and it is a joy to watch and one of the primary reasons in watching Demon Slayer. 
In
                  the subsequent episodes we are introduced to more demons and it is here where this series really shines. What I found good in these demon fights was every demon had their own fighting style. These different fighting techniques meant the subsequent battle scenes all played differently and the pace and flow of the fight was always different. No repetition to be found here which is quite something for a shounen series which are normally marred with repetition to the nth degree. These unique fights were further enhanced by the great animation that was on display. What is particularly striking and impressive was the water style sword techniques that Tanjirou deployed. It is the signature fighting style to this anime that never grows old.
Another notable point for Demon Slayer is that it goes out of its way to cover each demon’s backstory. Most of these stories are told to allow us to sympathise with the demon as the backstories covered are often sad and are told to humanise the demons encountered. The overriding message in these passages is that these demons are complex characters that more than simple mindless killers. 
Personally, I wasn’t totally convinced in the redemption points Demon Slayer was trying to project. To me the tales made me think more along the lines of the victim turn abuser cycle that whilst tragic did not absolve the abuser from their guilt. That is just my opinion though and I can see other people having opposing viewpoints to me. The jury is out on that one and it is certainly one of the talking points of the series. On balance though I would say these back stories added to the story rather than detracted from it. I also feel that these character expositions are done to cast doubt on the prevailing story narrative that demons equal bad and humans equal good which is a point that carries extra weight when we consider Nezuko and another notable demon.  
As Demon Slayer progresses, we begin to learn of the overall organisation of the demons and the underlying rivalry they have with the demon slayers. It all points to later epic battles with the stakes invariably rising as more is put on the line during future fights. How this goes is anyone’s guess but whilst this part of the series was pretty good, I found some of the later plot set pieces tended to lean on the standard shounen tropes more heavily. There is a notable patch near the end of the season where this is heavily focused on which I did consider was the weakest part of the show. That’s not saying it was bad, it was still good and if these points are developed properly could allow Demon Slayer to reach new heights. Moreover, my view could have been tainted by the fact that the previous battle arc was the one of the most epic battles in the entire show.  
Beyond the action and plot the series also largely delivers with its cast. Amongst the early action it becomes clear that Tanjirou and Nezuko hold a strong relationship towards each other that is endearing and sweet. The two will always cover each other’s back and we can tell that they are both strong in different ways. This is just as well as these two form the backbone of the Demon Slayer story. Tanjirou is a likeable guy you can root behind whilst Nezuko is a bad ass girl who also fills the moe/mascot character for the series.
Beyond those two main characters the support cast are a bunch with distinct personalities that will appeal to a wide range of people. I think the opinions of these characters will be more varied than the main duo. For example, I found Inosuke Hashibira a laugh whilst I was mildly irritated by Zenitsu Agatsuma. However, I can see people having the opposite opinion to myself but seeing as they are all distinctly different, I am sure there will be someone that appeals to your needs. 
Animation for Demon Slayer is one of the main highlights and strengths of the show. What is more this high standard of animation is maintained throughout the shows 26 episode running which is remarkable. The fight scenes coupled with the signature move sets of the demons/demon slayer really shine in this series and those great scenes are reason enough to watch Demon Slayer. Beyond the animation though the musical score is also strong as I enjoyed both the opening and ending songs. The opening theme is ""Gurenge"" by LiSA whilst Demon Slayer has three ending songs with ""from the edge"" by FictionJunction feat. LiSA (episodes 2-18, 20-25), ""Kamado Tanjirou no Uta"" by Go Shiina ft. Nami Nakagawa for episode 19. The opening theme is used for the ending for the opening and final episode of the series. 
Summary
This is a hit series. Great action scenes, a good story and likeable characters make this a series that many anime fans will find compelling. While there are moments it does adopt the standard shounen tropes you can’t say this series is similar to the typical shounen series like Naruto. Demon Slayer distinguishes itself with its fights being all unique and with the great animation and original water fighting style. Because of those factors these fights are always engaging, enjoyable and beautiful which is not something you can say for most anime series. 
The cast are likeable so you are vested and concerned about the journey of Tanjirou and Nezuko plus the supporting cast all have decent backstories to keep things fresh. If there is some criticism that could be made it is that some flashbacks felt unnecessary but this factor wasn’t abused so is easily overlooked. On the whole I struggle to see which type of anime fan would dislike Demon Slayer and is a show I would recommend. The only disclaimer I would add is some scenes are bloody so if you are particularly sensitive to violence then give this a pass.
Story 9 – From the beginning Demon Slayer reels you in with its early drama. The subsequent action scenes that follow ensure you stick around for the long haul. The weaving tale between the monstrous but relatable demons make you second guess what the right course of action is. I did feel that the series did run out of steam somewhat at the end but this could merely be the calm before the storm. Got to watch Infinity Train to find out if this is true!
Characters 7 – Tanjirou and Nezuko are the duo that are likeable and are easy to connect with. You want to know what will happen to them and they both develop in their own ways. The secondary cast is more of a mixed bag but there will be some amongst the lot that you will likely take to seeing as their personalities are varied. Character depth is given for the demon side and whilst we understand that on the whole, they are evil, things aren’t always black and white.
Animation/music 9 – Excellent and remarkable that this high standard is largely maintained throughout the whole 26 episode running. It is this animation plus the epic fight scenes that can easily win over fans and is perhaps the biggest strength of the series which is only made better by its strong musical score.
Overall 9 – A serious recommendation if you never watched Demon Slayer. The only people who would dislike this is if you have a strong aversion to violence. The great action scenes by itself make it a worthwhile watch but if you add the good story and likeable characters this is a seriously good series. You won’t find shows of this calibre every year.",9,monsta666

                I am writing this review to let others know that it would be a huge mistake to miss this anime. Why? Cause it so captivating that watching an episode feels like 5 minutes and after finishing it not only you are awaiting the next one but you feel satisfaction, you think about the episode, you ask yourself: What is this feeling - the feeling of joy and excitement? 
This anime reminds you why have you started watching anime! It's an art, it's a joy, you appreciate all the hard work that went into creating such a beautiful and fulfilling piece of animation.

                A promising story and world ruined by a terrible character.
Demon Slayer started off dark and interesting with great animation, character design, action, and worldbuilding. Then Zenitsu happened. The single-most annoying TV character to ever grace my screen. His constant shrieking and whining, besides being obnoxious and painfully unfunny, ruins the established tone and destroys all sense of pacing. The enjoyment and immersion is completely sucked out of the viewer over the span of just two introductory episodes with this character. When he's onscreen all you can think about is putting a bullet in your head and when he's offscreen you're just dreading his return. 
                  
So much potential squandered by such an egregiously bad character. The show would legitimately be 100x better if he were removed from it entirely. Very depressing to see. 4/10, could've been 8-9/10 without Zenitsu.",4,NewToAnime74

                Demon Slayer (Kimetsu no Yaiba) was a hell of a ride the first season, pun intended for the upcoming movie. I first became interested in the series once I learned that Ufotable was animating it, about a month or so before the first episodes premiere. Watched the first episode and was thoroughly impressed with the music and the way the CGI was handled. Went on to show my best friend it then the madman bought all the available volumes that were out. As someone who's caught up with the manga themselves, the anime has for the most part blown the source material out of the
                  water. Enough with the babbling though, here's my review for the potential anime of the year.
Story: Yes, yes we've seen it reiterated to ad nauseam, the story is nothing revolutionary and somewhat cliched. Your tried and true revenge story with a tinge of returning a loved one back to normal. The story is a-la Dororo and Fullmetal Alchemist combined to make a love child of the two. While cliches might turn some viewers off, I will always maintain the ideology that cliche is not inherently bad, it's how the author presents these familiar ideas and molds them into their own is where a series finds its true merit. The story is absolutely serviceable and sets out what it wants to achieve. 
Art/Animation: The character design primarily is definitely one of Gotouge's strong suits. Each character with an important role to play is clearly distinguishable from one another and they all seem to have a subtle aura to them that I can't quite decide on how to describe. The backgrounds come to life with the studios touch and makes the experience that much more easier to immerse yourself. The animation is what truly gives Demon Slayer's OMPH where it starts showing where the ones who are bringing the series to life know exactly how to handle the material. For example: when Tanjiro is fighting the demon with the drum, it's really muddied and scattered in the manga which effects the legibility of how the fight is playing out.  Within the anime however, we get to see crystal clear with the clever use of the CG for the rotating room, which in turn made the battle easier to digest. The fight with Rui in the manga itself really wasn't anything special, but with cleverly used techniques the animators made it a scene that not only made the anime as hyped as it is today, but made it a completely unforgettable moment that made use as  a viewer feel a plethora of emotion. 
Sound: The music is fitting of Demon Slayer to a T. From the folk tracks to fit with the historical and rural vibes, to the ending track of episode 19 and not to forget a great OP and ED too. As a music lover, I will always feel a good ost is better to experience than to read up about, go listen to some of the tracks in your free time the composer did a damn good job with the soundtrack. The VA's all fit their roles well and bring the characters to life for a memorable cast. Tanjiro has a very balanced and well thought choice for an actor, Zenitsu's VA portrays his character perfectly (find him annoying all you want), Inosuke has his brash and boneheaded personality shine through and Shinobu has a very calming yet haunting voice. 
Characters: The main group is the main focus here and was pretty polarizing for the greater part of the community. Tanjiro has a great sense of justice. He's not overly serious and edgy which too many MC's love falling into with a story about revenge. He cares deeply about his family and friends, he has empathy towards the demons despite the tragedies they have caused, he's understanding of their positions but realizes the crimes they've committed are not to be forgiven easily. He's a very human character with his own faults, but is someone who can be looked up to. There's not too much to describe Nezuko up to this point as except cute and S M O L. She's the lone survivor of  Tanjiro's family that was massacred while he was away in town and plays the role for Tanjiro's motivation to not only help her but others afflicted by the wrath of demons. Zenitsu is....something. He can be rather irritating and nerve grating with his behavior, despite him clearly being played up to being comedy relief. He has his moments, but I can get behind why most don't like him. He's essentially a far removed character from tragedy thrown into massive shenaningans which most normal people wouldn't be able to handle either. Inosuke is a very ""what you see is what you get"" type. He's stuck in his ways, stubborn to a fault and crude as one can be. His dimwitted nature makes him lovable if you ask me. 
Enjoyment: Demon Slayer has not only been a treat to read, but an even bigger delight to watch every Saturday and I'm sad to see it be done for the time being. TRAIN HYPE BAYBE. I'm glad to see the hype its garnered since before the premiere to now. The holdovers from non-seasonal watchers and dub watchers eat your heart out on this anime, Ufotable 100% delivered. Keep those memes coming everybody.
Overall: The overall experience will not be one I'll forget anytime soon and I'm patiently waiting for that upcoming movie. If you're a shonen fan, watch this as soon as you can if you haven't. For further recommendations I recommend: Dororo and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is a unique anime, simply because its main protagonist is still human and actually reacts to his wounds and has limits. 
I adore the fact that, essentially, there are no background characters. Every character has their own history, their own screen-time, and the demons, especially, are given their own story and narrative. 
Incredibly, the behaviors of the characters aren't hysterical and unbelievable (as many other anime series tend to do), instead, they are the exact opposite. I can connect to them and understand what they're doing perfectly.
The animation style is amazing, clear-cut and stylishly old-fashioned. I particularly adored the elemental animations.
The fight
                  scenes are well thought-out, smart, and tense. Many other anime of this genre seem to like unbeatable, god-like villains where the protagonist gets mortally wounded and still never gives up and wins somehow out of sheer good luck and sudden, inexplicable power. Not so, with this anime - in Kimetsu no Yaiba the protagonist tries hard, doesn't give up, but wins the battle with quick, strategic thinking and smart moves. Also, wounds sustained don't just disappear the very next episode, but Tanjirou struggles to fight even with cracked ribs and such - human, and realistic.
I recommend it to everyone. 10/10, exceeds expectations.",10,Peach_Storms

                It's an amazing anime!!! I fell in love with this show within the first episode itself!!! The ""family"" theme is focused on in this show with our beloved protagonists, Tanjiro and Nezuko. And this anime has an amazing villain, Muzan (idk if I spelled it correctly 😳). There aren't any characters any fan would come to hate (personal opinion). Plus the movies: Also awesome!!!❤️
Give it a try, and I'm sure you won't regret it. Even if you're new to the anime community, then also starting your journey with Demon Slayer/Kimetsu no Yaiba would be a great decision...

                WHAT CAN ASK FOR MORE? Perfect 10/10
An anime given all the characteristics its needs in order to make its audience ecstatic and hungry for more. From the start to finish of this season it followed completely its original story from manga, which didn't upset or left no vacant space for complaining. When someone appreciates hard work, there is no room for critic. Let's review Kimetsu No Yaiba kn details:
Storyline: Score 10/10
Demon slayer the name with the story can never be more appropriate. It does what its says. The characters build the story step by step with extraordinary excellence leaving its viewers dumbstruck. Every episode goes
                  perfectly developing its plotlines with exciting end, lets all crave for next. 
Characters: Score 10/10
The characters are finest in their own qualities. As people are different in character, this anime also illustrates its vast diversity excellently. The characters did hard work to develop themselves, has fear and imperfections, through courage and great training they step forward to counter the demons. Also demons has back story to cover their indentity. The character traits gives the audience inspiration to push past their own limitations. What an excellent representation!
Animation: Score 10/10
Unquestionably the animation is a major breakthrough in the anime industry to this date. Nothing like this animation has ever gotten aired. An amazing detailing of all frames displays uniqueness.
There is no ending to its positive aspects which don't deserve an excellent credit.

                Demon Slayer (2019), i was right from what i am expecting from the series, all i've seen is praise and adoration towards this series, and so i gave it a watch, and i'm rather mixed, i hate to say this show is overhyped, but it came out to me unfortunately that way, this is my review for the series:
Positives:
- I Love Tanjiro as a protagonist, he really stood out for that kind of protagonist in any other anime that i have watched, he is that overused righteous kind of character that is pretty much all of anime protagonists acts like him, but Tanjiro gave it
                  a different light, he has personality and he is cherishable and compelling, and he is one of the sole reason i kept on watching the series as for him being a great protagonist.
- The Animation is one of the best that i have ever seen in any other anime that i have ever watched, the Action is awesome it is fluid and fast phase, with High Definition its like i'm watching an Art Piece move, also the Art Style is unique, their good to look at, pretty great character deisgn per se, the 3D blends in well and the aesthetic and the Background is really well done, i like the setting of the late 1800s japan too as it cements itself as one of the those shows who sets itself in a time period where it is not that used anymore.
- The Fights is Creative and Clever. 
- the Soundtrack is pretty good, rather, the soundtrack is a little bit too grand and prestige for me, but it serves its purpose to the show, The Opening not gonna lie even tho it is recommended to death is a banger, i love the opening theme and the ending theme too.
- Some Characters are pretty well written like the side villains, they have a pretty good backstory espcially Rui (Rui so far is the best written character in the show), and some characters that i loved is Inosuke espcially and the ""Pillar Men"" and i love that some minor characters has character too, like those that gonna die has a humanity in them too.
- some of the Character Interactions is pretty well done and some of the gags really did made me chuckle a bit.
The Cons:
- The Story is a bit Average at best, its pretty cliched it definetly slates itself on the generic shonen setting, the story is not that interesting, it didn't show anything new, the world building is not that great, the concept of Demons is not that much new, and some of the plot for instance is just too fast to bear, epscially in the early episodes, little known information has been given to the characters before they move the story, and some came just out of nowhere, and some of the action is taking too long, all in all the Story is not that Great, nothing new nothing less. 
- The Lack of Emotion and Drama, in the first episode i was hooked for its drama and emotion that evoked through that episode, but that drama suddenly faded in the 2nd episode, some scenes could've done better with serious moments but it gets overshadowed by its comedy and over the top expressions, though they are some great dramatic moments in the show, but it didn't get that much and not that well executed making it feel unearned.
- The Comedy and Gags is not that Earned and Forced, my biggest gripes to this show is the Forced Comedy and Gags that runs through the show, espcially that Chummy Interaction of the characters, sometimes it came out as Abnoxious to watch, making a little bit annoying, and it designates itself to the serious moments, i'm not saying this show should be serious, but they should atleast tone down a little bit, some of it works as it gave me a little chuckle but most of it its just over the top, with this the case it tarnishes that impactful and emotional beat the first epsisode establishes and show.
- Zenitsu, i hate this annoying mf ever since i saw him, he is so obnoxious and loud, and forceful as hell, not even his serious moments can make me love this character, as what i said about what i don't like the story, it moves fast, Zenitsu could've been a good character for me if it wasn't for the obnoxious characterization he has.
In Conclusion:
The Show is unfortunately underwelhming, i expect great things about this show as i heard great things about it, this show could've been better if they have taken it a little serious, and lessen the Forced Gags and Comedy, and also make the story polished, for it atleast to have met my expectations in a good way.

                Let me start this off by saying this is my opinion, as well as my first review, I'm not at all experienced in reviewing things however my opinion on Demon Slayer is definitely one important to me that I'd like to share. I have Demon Slayer as a 5/10, but there are many issues I have with not the anime, but the community that surrounds it, which doesn't effect my score. I'll start with the actual anime and my final word on Demon Slayer will be my opinion on the majority of people who watch it. This will spoil the first few episodes and some
                  minor and major events
Story: 4/10
Demon Slayer's story is as decent (or indecent) as the hentai you watched last night. We start off with our protagonist, Tanjiro Kamado, who's family is hard working and happy. He goes to town to get some work done and when he gets home he finds his entire family has been massacred by demons. After that, he discovers his sister is alive yet has been turned into a demon. He decides to set out on a journey with her to fight the leader of the demons to turn his sister back to a human. That sounds unique, right? Well, while the premise might seem even slightly bearable, it soon turns into any other cliche monster of the week anime, and brings in demons every few episodes for our protagonists to fight for an episode or two. Soon Tanjiro finds some friends to travel with and the story progresses on as it has for the entire 26 episode run, kill demons, recover and train, kill demons, recover and train, and so on. It really isn't too special after the first few episodes in terms of story, and very rarely gets exciting. It literally spends its last like 5 episodes of footage comprising exclusively of the crew recovering. Who wants to spend almost 2 hours of their life watching that?
Art: 10/10
Ufotable as usual has graced Demon Slayer with a top of the line adaptation, with their beautiful and vibrant animation that really puts itself out there. The fluidity of the fights and the bold character designs are a highlight of the story and is definitely one of the only good things this anime has going for it, and one of the only things that deserves the praise its been getting.
Sound: 10/10
Just like the art, the sound really is amazing. The opening is great, the ending is great, the soundtrack is great. The OST really brings out even more feeling and excitement for certain fights, especially when Tanjiro is fighting Rui. Kamado Tanjirou no Uta was the perfect song to play during Tanjiro's likely triumph over Rui, and really brought out both emotion and excitement from me.
Character: 3/10
The characters in Demon Slayer are repetitive and disgustingly bland and predictable. Tanjiro is your usual Shounen protagonist, he's powerful and has an optimistic personality and won't stop fighting for the people he believes in, but that's it. Inosuke and Zenitsu aren't really different, they each have a few traits that become super repetitive and predictable that it almost becomes annoying. Inosuke's thing is not to listen to anyone and to basically be a total meathead that does what he wants. Zenitsu's thing is being the usual crybaby that has exceptional power in a fight, but what's unique about that? He can only access that power when he's asleep. And Nezuko doesn't really have anything to her, she just helps out in some fights and makes the entire community squeal because of how cute she is. To me, Zenitsu is the only character I even slightly enjoy seeing on screen.
Enjoyment: 6/10
This show is fairly enjoyable, although it has more flaws than my ability to score anime, it was enough to keep me coming back every week to watch a new episode. Some parts got me really pumped up and some got me really sad, it's very good at bringing out emotions and I personally think that's one of its only good traits, though a very good one to have.
Before my overall grade, let me say something about MOST Demon Slayer fans and its community. It's not as good as they say it is. I like Demon Slayer, I like Demon Slayer a lot, it was really fun to watch, and I really did enjoy it. However, most fans of the show are unbearable, saying it's ""anime of the decade"" or ""the best anime ever"", but it really isn't that. They say everything is perfect about it, but it really isn't that. They say it's a completely unique show that really stands out, but it really isn't that. They say everyone should watch it because everyone will like it, but not everyone will. The bottom line is, I do have a lot of issues regarding the show's community and it's critically overrated. This is only my opinion, and that's all.
Now, Overall: 5/10
Demon Slayer is the very meaning of the word mediocre. Though I enjoyed a fair amount of it, I was really only immersed in it due to Ufotable's exceptional animation and art. However, the soundtrack was just as good as the animation, and most of the time the dreadful characters and completely abysmal story take the anime to a new low. Take this review as a grain of salt, as it's my first review, and is slightly driven by my feelings towards the community. But dismissing everything else, Demon Slayer is a pretty OK anime at best and has no business near the best of 2019. But, ask it to someone who's only watched Naruto and 8 episodes of that corny love drama that aired last year and they'll probably tell you Demon Slayer is one of the greatest anime of all time.",5,Speeeedy
38000,"
                When I heard about Demon Slayer, people were pretty hyped up about it. There were countless people who recommend me this Anime. My expectations were pretty high for this Anime. But, I was disappointed, not with the animation but with the story.Its pretty generic to be honest. The motivation for me to watch the next episode of any anime is the story, this anime just didn't intrigue me so much.
Animation 10/10
I will give the animators respect. I really see the passion behind every frame, every stroke, its amazing. I wish the story was a bit more interesting. I mean I just watched 6 Episodes, I
                  guess its way too early to judge. But how far I have watched, I guess I will not get back to this franchise anyway.",4,upstairsrice
38000,"
                I had to drop this because it was annoying the hell out of me.
Exhibit A: MC is being trained as a demon slayer by the Great Master Trainer of Demon Slayers who says ""I've taught you everything I can, go into the woods and don't come back until you've broken a magic boulder"", so the MC goes into the woods and, despite the fact that the Great Master Trainer of Demon Slayers has *cough* ""taught you everything I can"", our MC can't break the damn boulder until the ghosts of two former students of the  Great Master Trainer of Demon Slayers have spent 6
                  more months training the MC in stuff that the Great Master Trainer of Demon Slayers apparently didn't know or couldn't be bothered to teach him despite the fact that he, the Great Master Trainer of Demon Slayers, explicitly said that he had ""taught you everything I can"".
Exhibit B: Once the MC has been ""taught everything I can"", (and then some other stuff that he couldn't because... some reason that definitely isn't that the writing is bad) MC is sent off to his final test. The final test is held in more woods and there are demons, which is not much of a problem except for some huge OP demon that shouldn't be there at all and which (get this) has been killing off all the Demon Slayer trainees for years but the actual Demon Slayers, who know all about it, have done absolutely nothing about it except sent it more trainees to eat. Now i'm a trained teacher by the way and where I come from excessively dangerous demons that eat the students would be regarded as a 'safeguarding issue', but apparently in the world of demon slaying, just letting your trainees get eaten for years is fine because you've really got to have standards I guess.
Exhibit C: Now the MC has completed his training and sorted out the issue of the OP demon eating all the trainees that the trainers didn't see fit to deal with, the Great Master Trainer of Demon Slayers says *cough* ""I've taught you everything I know about demons ... now go off and find some demons to fight"". Are you perchance, dear reader, getting some deja-vu vibes? Good, because the MC runs straight into a demon and has to figure out something obvious and important about demons that the Great Master Trainer of Demon Slayers apparently didn't know or couldn't be bothered to teach him despite the fact that he, the Great Master Trainer of Demon Slayers, explicitly said that he had ""taught you everything I know about demons"".
Yes, it looks good. But the writing totally killed my interest by episode 6 or 7. I hope I have conveyed why.",3,Vandervekken
38000,"
                Beautiful, absolutely beautiful. 
This anime is perfect in every way I can think of. The story gives a bit of everything. character development, comedy, violence, you name it. I can't get over how beautifully the story flows and the way everything comes together.
The art and animation are top-tier, the movements all seem natural and come together as one. The art style stays true to traditional manga style while stepping its boundaries. I have no doubt as to why it received the best animation of the decade award.
The voice actors are superb. Its almost as if they were made for the characters they voice. I still
                  wonder how Inosuke and Zenitsu's voice actors still have all their vocal cords intact though.
I would've liked a hint more of romance scenes happen with the characters but I'm not complaining. The personalities are wonderful and it was always nice to see them on-screen, while also having those characters you hate. The interactions between the characters are also pretty realistic.
It was honestly love at first sight with this anime. I'm obsessed with all the little details and the way it all comes together. I would recommend reading the manga, the anime only gives you a small taste of the roller coaster of emotions and true beauty Kimetsu no Yaiba.",10,Certified_Rat
38000,"
                First, I would like to say that Kimetsu no Yaiba isn't nearly the best shounen. In fact the only shounen I've watched that are worse are Boruto and Sword Art Online. When you compare Kimetsu no Yaiba to masterpieces like One Piece, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood or Fate/Zero, obviously it's lacking in many things. However, in general as an anime, I would give it a 7.
Shounens are on average much better than most other anime, as the worst shounen is Sword Art Online, and it's actually watchable, compared to bad harems, like Date A Live which isn't watchable.
Onto the actual reviewer:
Story (5):
The story is super bland,
                  and seems like plucking a side character from Tokyo Ghoul, and throwing the into another world. Tanjiro's background is extremely bland, and super generic. Story telling is very bland as well. It's literally just the main character trying to slay the strongest (insert bad guy). It's like Bleach, it's like Tokyo Ghoul, it's like KonoSuba. There is literally nothing special about the backstory, there's literally nothing special about the plot, it's nothing special in the least bit. The power scaling of 1, entry level demon (final test tentacle guy) , 2, normal demon (throwing balls person), 3, past demon moon (Room drum person), 4 (Rui). The power scaling is absolutely trash, in the sense that there is a huge power gap between every single enemy/hurdle that the MC has to overcome. Also, the demons get stronger and stronger exponentially. Rui could 1 shot drum person, drum person can 1 shot ball person, ball person can 1 shot testicle dude, and Muzan can one shot all of them in his sleep while he's on Cocaine while he's watching Hentai. See? Makes no sense.
Art (8):
The art's good. I like the water and fire thing. Not much else to say, I felt like Fate Zero was better.
Sound(7):
I watched with the sound off, so i just gave it the average of everything else. I guess the intro is good.
Characters(7):
The characters are super bland, all of them are super generic. Tanjiro is your average Kirito dude. Gary Stue (Mary Sue), the epitome of perfection. All in all, I hate Tanjiro. Next, Inosuke, boar person. I think she/he (I forgot) is quite interesting, as he's the only character with an interesting personality. He/she actually has a personality that is not generic. You could argue that he/she is like Naruto, but he/she has a definitive personality that NO ONE ELSE DOES. Zenitsu is so average. He's literally just Sanji (simp) + Cike567 (falls asleep, turn godly). I guess the comedy is average (like We Never Learn level), but I guess Zenitsu simpery does bring it up a notch.
Enjoyment(7):
I watched Bleach, so Kimetsu no Yaiba feels terrible. I also read half of Tokyo Ghoul, so Kimetsu no Yaiba feels terrible. It is super average.
Overall(7):
None of the points I mentioned proves that it's bad, it's just generic. That's why I gave it a 7, because average shounens are like at 7, and it's a super average shounen (NOT ON THE LEVEL OF FIREFORCE of course)",7,Treeusuiwings

                They always say first impression is the last impression and Kimetsu no Yaiba truly impressed me from the get-go and I loved it to bits, every little bit. A pleasant surprise last spring.
I write my review in my honest opinion and in respect of my hobbies as a writer and artist, for myself first of all and for all of who may read. 
A summary of the opinion can be found below, otherwise, here we go: 
[[Story]]  [9] ー  A simple premise, clear goals and rising stakes. 
The format of a winning plot usually involves the above in any mentioned order. There is
                  an art-form for authors who can come up with concise premises to novels and stories, and yet manage to make it interesting enough to hook the viewer/reader in. 
•●The setting of Edo Japan is and the concept of Oni/Demons are key factors in building Kimetsu's world. This combination of fiction and history are not that rare for the manga/anime industry, Series that take up japanese culture, especially round this era in time tend to pan out of focus, spoon feeding cultural details at the viewer. They usually reach a halt to present a coherent world. But Gotōge's moderation in exposition and digress makes sense when writing a purpose driven story, and it works. 
•●There are countless times throughout my time watching anime where I wonder, ""Why isn't this character recognising this guy who he saw a moment ago?"", ""Why was X unaffected by what just happened?"" As authors in shounen anime/manga tend to lose touch with reality and can only produce physical conflict with substance or ""coda"". Why is it so difficult for writers in shounen to write a believable person? Well, that's not the case for Koyoharu Gotōge who teetered perfection when it came to character development and not just persona arc, but even characters reacting to little details, changing their minds or demeanour due to emotion or reason, and learning to outsmart than outpower. This doesn't just apply to Tanjiro the main hero of Kimetsu, but it rubs off on his two companions. Even minor characters who only appear for one episode, at some occasion reappear to show development or instil believability. Something that Kimetsu gets absolutely right. 
•●Another thing that Gotõge does right is characterisation. It would seem he writes great scenarios throughout the stories for various characters' interactions. But really what he is doing is good characterisation. He builds characters with one dominating social quirk (which would seem lazy in writing principle and not complex enough) but those characters are meant to be fleshed out by interacting with one another, which shows other aspects of them. Not to mention artistic characterisation which is absolutely on point, and I lack the words to describe my gratitude towards amazing art styles like Gotoge's. Needless to say this is out of place for a shounen, where characters act like lifeless drawings. 
•● Lastly, the way the plot is structured with a singular goal and rising stakes with each step towards it, makes it very suspenseful to watch and read. A great asset to a successful story. The sheer unpredictability of what would happen next, and the mystery that the author holds over various concepts and key characters in the story, mixed in with the knowledge of having to reaching that final goal is such a charming force that compels you to keep reading/watching. You're not left wondering for too long either, from the start tension rises to the heavens, and the plot marches into fire at every stop.
[[Art]] [10] ー Catchy, quirky and highly stylistic. 
A combination of easy to recognise characters and simple designs, visually defining quirks and Gotoge's cute small figured style is something you cannot as an artist not smile at. 
The art speaks volumes in this series, it's easy to recognise an already small cast in this shounen by just colour patterns or those unique quirky eyes. Ufotable the animating studio took this to eleven with their colourful and vivid representation of Gotoge's style and character design. 
There are instances when you think some characters might share Kamado's own eyes or hair. Heck, some of characters have very similar faces, most females in this series do. But then again, Gotoge makes up for it in other compartments in their design, so I can hardly sin him with so much diversity.
I will say a few words on music since peasant like me cannot make music and is unqualified to speak of it. I have to say Ufotable excelled at making what I consider to be one of the best ost in the entire industry. From the sad melodic flutes, to the upbeat scores they ーthey naild the Japanese style and it resonates with you for days after you're done watching. 
♤♡◇♧Score & Summary ♤♡◇♧
I loved Kimetsu, I really did. It's compact narrative lends well with the rich characters both visually and narratively. Gotoge old school narrative brings higher stakes with every page flipped or episode watched. It reminded of the old days of Dragon Ball Z Sayian's saga, and HxH. Kimetsu cleverly dodges the genre's major pitfalls, while showcasing a great deal of character development and believability. Its beautifully illustrated by the author himself in his adorable style, almost as elegant as the culture it's set in. With a yet small cast of highly enjoyable characters. 
However, an air of mystery yet looms around some of the plots key players which when and how they are revealed could make or break this story.  
I give Kimetsu no Yaiba Season 1 a [10] [Exceptional] such a remarkable experience, one very rare indeed in this genre that has been dishing out rehashed stories with lackluster cast and little respect for its audience. The stakes are very high in my expectation from Kimetsu no Yaiba.

                Demon Slayer's characters are cardboard. The main character, Tanjiro Kamado, sucks balls. 
Weak motivation from all characters and too many flashbacks. Tanjiro trains for an episode and all of a sudden he's a beast. You only get to see his family for 3 minutes before they are killed which does not allow you to feel for them like Tanjiro does so you feel disconnected. 
This anime is the most cliche I have ever seen. 
CGI is used well at times, but unfortunately most of the time it is just jarring to see. 
This anime is the definition of mediocre and should only be watched if

                Wow, just wow. When I first started the show I was quite sceptical, the reviews were quite positive and I wanted to see if it lived up to the hype. Honestly, after reading the summary I wasn't really that amped up; I mean, it's a show called Demon slayer, where the main characters slay demons, not that exiting, but being me, the shonen degenerate scum that I am, I gave it a watch... And it blown me away, the story wasn't anything new, but it took the generic shonen formula, and polished it to a tee. 
The art and animation was also really good, the
                  thick lines and light colours reminded me of old traditional Japanese Sansui Chokan, every frame was a painting, a work of art, it's brilliant. Now, on the topic of CGI, many people always seem to hate it, I get it. CGI is not traditional animation, and it looks a bit weird, but when used correctly can bring out everything else. In Kimetsu no Yaiba, Ufotable managed to blend CG and traditional animation so seamlessly, that you barely notice, with this, they can manage to create gorgeous camera angles and amazing fight choreography, it's truly breathtaking.
The sound mixing is also amazing, each sword stroke, each step is powerful, it makes you truly feel immersed in the world of the show.
The characters are also done very real, the chemistry between the main cast was very nice, especially the relationship between Tanjiro and Nezuko. The demons personalities were also very unique and real, no two demons have the same personality and their own goals.
Overall, I enjoyed the show. I give this show a 9/10 for excellent animation, direction, choreography and sound design.",9,Marth_43

                I'd have to say that this is defifinetly over-hyped/overrated for a significant amount, because of its fanbase(like MHA, like seriously how does it jump from under 8.80 to 8.97)
I do think that this is one of the best Shounen I have ever watched because of its characters, message about accepting things for what they are, pacing ,animation, art and story telling.
From what limited things I have seen of the entirety of this first season I'd say it does have the chance to make up for its quite over-hyped beginning!
Overall I'd have to say this show is still great!
It does deserve to be in the top

                I was disappointed because people say it will be the best shounen anime. I don't understand what else does this anime has except animation.This also has incredibly depicted fight scenes.But can animation alone cover for a poor story?
I would have loved this show if this wasn't so overhyped.
It fails to have a strong interesting start.Beat a demon and turn your sister to human. This cant even be compared to other shounens. For example: A kid leaves his town on a small boat to gain everything which can be achieved in his world and become the king of pirates (one piece, this idea sparks interest in
                  your mind to see his journey), A high school who can see ghosts and feels sorry for not being able to help them gets the power of Gods(soul reapers) overnight and now can purify souls and fight evil spirits (Bleach) etc. 
Now, every aspect of the starting story feels similar to fullmetal alchemist. Elric Brothers/Tanjiro doesn't have a family anymore, Al/Nezuko isn't human anymore, Mustang/Tomoika gets impressed by Ed/Tanjiro and asks him to join State Alchemists/Demon Slayer Corps, Elric Brother/Tanjirou and Nezuko now go on a journey in order to make Al/Nezuko human again. So you immediately compare KNY to FMA and get disappointed in the end because it is all about to beat some demon 
Later the old man forces the idea 'Humans are friends, Demons are bad' on Nezuko. So this eliminates any chance of character Development.If you can force this idea on all demons why do you suffer from demons in the world in the first place. The MC is pretty dull compared to any other currently airing shounen MCs as Meliodas or Midoriya. There is a yellow guy who isn't strong at first but he changes and now can beat anybody, yes you know who it is : Escanor. This character zentisu is very annoying and cries 5 times each ep. Characters like inosuke, nezuko and tomoika are amazing characters
The main villain is said to be the strongest demon and can turn anybody into a demon. The first impression of the main villain is very strong and is shown amazingly.He has a family.Upon seeing the MC,he  immediately turns a guy into a demon and gets his family to a safe place. But the next time you see him, he is dressed as a woman and kills his own people. Why would you turn people into demons then kill them off because a demon of the same rank died due to attack by an elite of the opposite forces. We see in ep19 that tanjirou uses his special fire breathing technique to kill Rui and then celebrates with nezuko. But Rui says he chopped his own head off. This means tanjirou never touched Rui's neck. How tf Tanjirou thinks he just killed of his enemy by swinging his sword in air? i mean wtf? After all these years of training the mc cant tell if hit anything with his sword or not.
The writer tries to pull a sneaky on the readers and now the amazingly animated fight gets dumb af.

                People have no taste.
I thought users on MAL are more experienced than other platforms such as imdb when it comes to anime, but I was proven wrong. KnY is a prime example of recency bias where anime noobs are impressed with the show's visuals and soundtrack and completely forget about its mediocre to poor storyline and character writing.
The original material is decent at best. It was almost under the radar until the anime hit big. The reason is simply because it just was not great. There are many underrated gems in the manga world, but KnY is not one of them. KnY brings nothing new
                  to the table. It is a blend of all the shounens you have seen before, and doesn't even bother to bring any twist to it. There are no themes being explored, no moral dilemmas, no philosophical debate, no tough choices. None. You don't even really need to pay attention to understand what is going on. You can just watch the fights and read the summary of the plot online and you'll miss nothing, because the only thing enjoyable about this anime is its beautifully choreographed fight scenes.
The writing is clumsy, awkward, and at times confusing, especially when it comes to comedy and exposition. For example, in the first episode, the author is trying to introduce the world set-up by having the characters talk about it. But why are the characters taking about the history of demons as if they don't know about them already? The main character's power is also never clarified. His power seems to magically stretch and shrink to suit the plot. If he needs to see ghosts, he gets to see ghosts. If he needs a power-up, he gets a power-up. How does he get a power-up? Simple, by...focusing on his breath (or by flashbacks, the usual shonen power-driver). 
Characters are likeable, but they are more one-dimensional than a number line. The reason why the characters are agreeable is because they don't have to make any tough choices or experience internal conflict that bring out the worst in them.  They are very much your average Mary Sue. And then there is that one character who won't shut up and grow a pair of balls. The non-perverted Mineta of Demon Slayer. 
The fights are formulaic. If you have seen one fight, you have seen it all. The breathtaking visuals and animation come through and save the fights though, so they are still enjoyable. The main character, however, won't shut up with his internalization during these fights, so I was getting annoyed.  
The villains are incredibly boring and shallow. You cannot even remember any of their names. Nothing of the story comes off as a surprise if you have watched many shounens, so I am not kept on edge at all. Mind you, no one cared about the anime until ep 19 where the visuals stole the show, and all of a sudden the anime became great in some people's eyes. That's laughable. 
The soundtrack is amazing, but some of the music edits were off. The fight scenes should have some badass, suspenseful music but they inserted some slow, somber music instead which prevented me from enjoying the fighting sequence fully.
If you are a veteran anime watcher who rated this highly, shame on you. This anime is objectively mediocre except for its art and sound. It's fine if you enjoyed it, but it is a different matter when it comes to RATINGS, which are supposed to be more objective. This rating is completely inflated. 
I would change the ratings if the future episodes proved me wrong, but I follow the manga and since it already ended without any twists, I am certain my ratings remain the same.

                I dunno why I waited so long to write a review but this is definitely worth reviewing. I gave Demon Slayer a 10 when it ended but thinking about it for this review a 9 feels better because some things could've been better. These are all just little nitpicks tho I totally adore this show.
I think instead of waiting until the final episode to go deeper into Muzan's character he should've been developed a little earlier. The show could've been more intense if we knew how bad Kibitsuji was from early on. But seeing his evilness at the end makes the future of Demon Slayer
                  more interesting so I see why it was done that way. 
Also this show was a little too episodic for me to call it a masterpiece. That's probably the main reason im rating 9 instead of 10. I like shows more when everything ties together a bit more. Giving every villain an innocent back story got kind of old as well. There's no reason to make us feel bad for every bad guy.
Obviously the animation and art is amazing I enjoyed looking at every moment. There is some CGI but it's done right where you barely notice it and it's not during big moments. This show is a great example of how CGI should be done. No complaints there. I usually don't mention voice acting but it was definitely good.
Hopefully we don't have to wait too long to get some more of this because this could turn into an all-time great if the mangaka can keep building on it. Sometimes the hype dies down when we have to wait too long like Attack on Titan.",9,PunkyBoyGWiz

                I want to give a spoiler free review best I can. This was a feast for the eyes on every level.  I'm not a diehard shounen fan, but found myself falling for the animation, characters, and unique story presented here. The series has special easter eggs in it for those who have read the manga (but never takes away from the story for those who have not).   I haven't enjoyed an action anime like this since Attack On Titan.   The emotion wrapped up in each scene and character (even the demons) felt different than any other shounen  I've watched.
                   In addition, the core relationship between the main character and his sister never felt inappropriate as some shows have made a sibling relationship out to be.",10,Writehandedsan

                I have mixed feelings about Demon Slayer, and quite frankly, was so frustrated with this series that I will probably not continue it. But I stuck through 26 episodes anyway, hoping for a change of heart. And frankly, I'm still quite confused how I feel toward this series. I gave it a 6 merely in recognition of its art and the genius of Episode 19, but if one of those factors had been missing, the score would have been lower.
Let's look at the positives first. The premise is interesting enough. A young boy learns to become a demon slayer in order to search for a
                  way to reverse his sister's demon-state so that she may become human again. From the first episode, the plot seemed interesting. The artwork is, needless to say, impressive. There is no doubt about it. And when I was deep into this anime, bored out of my mind, what came through? Episode 19. Despite my negative feelings toward this series, I can say without a doubt that Episode 19 was impressive and peaked my interest...before my interest fell again the next week.
My biggest issue with Demon Slayer is the pacing. As is typical of shounen, each battle scene needs an extra 10-15 minutes of deep, insightful thoughts in slow-motion time. It's interesting in some aspects, but in an anime like this, where every episode is an extremely drawn-out shounen fight scene, it becomes repetitive and, quite frankly, boring to watch. I wanted to pull my hair out sitting through battles that were 4-6 episodes long in the later half of the season. This could just be a personal preference. I don't enjoy watching battles that carry out over more than, let's say (if I'm being generous), 3 episodes. It actually makes sense that Demon Slayer is transitioning to a movie for their next arc, as that feels more appropriate than me waiting a week to watch 20 extra minutes of the same battle scene, except there's a bit more deep contemplation, the stakes are raised a little higher, and ""Oh no! Will our fighters win this time? Find out next week, for Part 8 of That One Boss Battle."" (You would think this is overexaggeration, but it's not.)
Of course, the characters are mostly fine. Nezuko is cute and has stolen the hearts of many. But something about Zenitsu makes me want to bang my head against a wall.
So, in conclusion, just watch Episode 19 to say you've seen it, or if you really want to get a feel for the show, watch the 7 episode arc where Episode 19 occurs, but other than that, I wouldn't give this overrated anime the time of day.

                I have a lot to say about this show, and I choose to leave it without a rating on my anime list for a reason. Kimetsu no Yaiba is the definition of ""Yeah, you can cheat off of my homework, but change it so it doesn't look like you cheated"", says 20 years of shounen original greats, as Koyoharu Gotouge walks over to the Xerox copy machine, dead set on having no original ideas. As scathing of a claim as this may seem, I once had this show at a 7/10, with which some personal friends of mine started to attack me for having it
                  so low, and liking other shows more than it, and that is what made me realize what I hate about this series so much.
Demon Slayer is purely style over substance.
There is very little to be had here that can't be found in any other series. Goody-two-shoes main character, annoying side characters that hinge off of a single personality trait, and writing that can only be described as finishing your homework before you walk into class. The references to school are intentional, as following and talking about this show with others is just as senile as a college lecture. 
Upon my first watch of Demon Slayer, I really enjoyed the series. I didn't have many issues, it was up there as one of my favorites. That held true until I thought about it for a little bit, and realized that studio ufotable was the nicest thing to happen to this anime. If this adaptation was done by anyone else, I firmly believe the series would not be nearly as well received. After asking some of my friends, the only things I would hear is rose tinted glowing reviews, most of which stemmed from how cool the animation was, and nothing about the meat on the bone of why its really so good. I decided to start reading the manga after where the anime left off, just to quickly lose interest because I didn't have flashy colors to mask how boring everything else was. 
Many other genuinely critical reviews say similar things, so my comments don't add much to the conversation, but no matter how many sprinkles you put on a dirt cake, its still dirt, and the same goes for a shallow mold of every shounen that came before it. After thinking about demon slayer, all I feel is a desire to watch a series with an original idea.",4,timidphossu

                Demon Slayer is one of the coolest anime I ever watched in 2019, the art style is supreme and is beyond better than you think. Mixed 3D and 2D together and so aesthetic and gorgeous!!! Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. If you dare to give this anime a 4-7 out of 10, is absolutely shocker for entire world. I really really like the music and the last scene of Tajiro VS Rui, is awesome of the awesome. I mean 9 hashiras...Remind me back the bleach anime 12 captain. Story is build up very well that Tajiro wanna protect her cute Kawaii little sister turn into demon, adorable.
                  In order continue their journey and saving her sister, he have to draw blood sample from demon but that happen, Tajiro have to be strong and help by Tomioka finding his teacher Urokodaki for training Tajiro become demon slayer. And so the story begins. The only slight problem is that almost all the characters eye is quite identical and the his sister scene quite less. I don't have to say anymore because this anime is excellent and incredible works from studio, highly recommand to watch. Overall, 9 out of 10 for me.",9,jacktea0092

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is the kind of show I don't really have to go into too much detail about too explain why it's so great. Just like the show, this review will be to the point and simple.
I'll get my gripes out of the way now. There are some characters, one specifically that I almost hate to see on screen. I understand that a character should have a specific theme or trope, it's an effective way of giving extra personality to a character. But this should be done in moderation and not too the point where this character makes you want to rip your ears
                  off every time they are on screen. 
Now the best part about this show is the animation in my opinion. Ufotable have yet again gone above and beyond with mixing CG into their animation to make some breathtaking scenes. Though, unlike they did with the ""Fate"" series, what they did with Kimetsu no Yaiba is they used it all the time. Which is brilliant, unlike many studios Ufotable are highly adept at using CG which means you can get some incredible shots and angles you would never be able to do via traditional animation.
Another great selling point of this show is how it has the perfect blend of ""emotion application"", meaning that it's funny moments, sad moments and hype moments are all where they should be. Many shows will add a funny moment in during the hypest parts and kill the vibe and to some extent Kimetsu no Yaiba also does this. The key here is that they blend them together, moments of action are swiftly followed by a peaceful sadness as a hype moment turns into a serene and beautifully animated moment that takes your breath away.  
Now, towards the start of this show, I had a big problem with the pacing. At first, I hated how fast it was and I wanted to see the slow progression Tanjiro was going through. I hated how we never saw him really travelling and how he just seemed to magically arrive at his destination. But, as I watched more and more I realised that this was a good thing. Sure I would still have loved a slightly slower start but the pay off as the series progressed was worth it. Rather than giving you lots of time to see Tanjiro progress from point zero, the show lets you see him progress as a person and as a slayer from point ten. Which is something I loved. Many shonen protagonists, not all, have this issue of progression. The growth is forced into moments it shouldn't be in e.g. a hype fight or a random dream and while these can work occasionally it's pretty lazy writing. Tanjiro avoids this trope, the fact that the pacing so quick means that we get realistic and entertaining progression. Its the classic ""show don't tell"" and while examples of this would go into spoiler territory I can use this example. There is a time when Tanjiro helps/saves a man, now this man has had a traumatic experience and when Tanjiro tries to console him, the man claims he is too young to understand. Now, other shonen protagonists would ruin this moment by shouting back and turning the moment into a ""funny"" scene. But instead, we see Tanjiro just calmly bidding him farewell only for the man to apologise and comment on how while he looks so young Tanjiro has the air of a hardworking man. So, how does this relate to my point? Well, here we are given a clear moment to see Tanjiro's actions, we see all of what the man see's well before he apologizes and says it himself. We are shown the growth of Tanjiro well before it is told and pointed out too us. The show portrays Tanjiro in such a way that doesn't mean we need to be told about every little change he has undergone because it's shown the whole time, we as the viewer are not force-fed information and made out to be dumb or incapable of understanding subtle nuances in a scene.
Overall the show is great, it has a simple story but this allows for in-depth character development. The animation is astounding and every moment has a purpose. It's funny, sad, hype and complelling and I would highly recoment it. 9/10",9,LVLradio

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of the best new animes of the season. It has fantastic characters, phenomenal action, and superb animation.  And while it appears to have designs on being the next long running anime, it differs from the likes of Naruto, One Piece and MHA, as it is extremely, EXTREMELY gory.  There seems to be a decapitation every other episode.  You're not going to get through most episodes without seeing some blood soaked corpse being flung about, or some demon gnoshing on human guts.  
It's a strange contrast, considering that without all of the gore, it would feel like
                  another Bleach or Fairy Tail.  There's a big cast of colorful characters, (my favorite of which are Zenitsu and Lady Shinobu) making up the Demon Hunter's Association.  The set up really isn't that much different from the Soul Society in Bleach.  It's an eclectic group of swordsmen who go out and kill demons like they were Hollows.  Although, there is a difference in that they do attempt to make you feel sympathy for the demons, as they were once human.  The MC, Tanjiro, as you might expect, is sympathetic towards them because of his own plight with his (adorable) sister Nezuko.  
The struggle of Tanjiro trying to heal Nezuko leads to one of the most awesome dynamics of this anime and also sets it apart from other Shounen.  There aren't many brother/sister duos in anime who are out there wrecking shop like Tanjiro and Nezuko do.  In particular, their fight in the spider forest was absolutely INSANE.  I hope to see more tandem fighting with them in season 2 and in the upcoming Infinity Train movie. 
Another aspect of the anime that I enjoy is the humor.  The anime is very funny when it wants to be. The comedic relief is definitely Zenitsu and Inosuke, Tanjiro's other sidekicks.  Although, the anime doesn't try too hard to be funny.  It mostly slips in the comedy in between the intense fights.  
There's really not much to hate here.  It is really just an introductory season, so you're not going to get any closure or major confrontations between major players. But, with an introduction so awesome, I can only imagine how fantastic the payoff will be, in future seasons when we do see showdowns between the Upper 12 Kizuki and the Hashiras and Muzan vs. Tanjiro.

                I kept going back on forth between 9/10 and 10/10 as far as what rating to give this. I settled on a 9 and it's fine if you disagree with me. Honestly I'd give it a 9.5 if I could! Demon Slayer both *is* and *isn't* your typical shonen anime; it is very similar to anime like Bleach or Inuyasha that feature Japanese clothing and swords and demon slaying, yet I think it's far better than either of those shows. The story of Demon Slayer isn't anything revolutionary but it's solid and told very well. We have a brother whose family is murdered and is
                  trying to cure his sister who has been turned into a demon. That's why he becomes a demon slayer in the first place, to collect samples and hopefully run into the demon who cursed his sister. This motivation was so much more effective in getting me to root for Tanjiro as opposed to the cliche ""I wanna be the wizard king/shaman king/king of games"" etc. that I always see from a shonen protagonist. There's something about Tanjiro that makes him almost impossible to dislike, whether it's his earnestness, his naivete, or his incredible empathy (for both humans and even demons) that draws you in. I got so invested in the close relationship between Nezuko and Tanjiro and I just want them to be ok. That's why I think if Demon Slayer had kept the focus solely on those two characters it would've been a much stronger show. 
The one weakness in the show, in my opinion, was its cast of characters. I compared this show to Bleach earlier and I meant this in more ways than one. One problem I had with Bleach was the show had the tendency to keep introducing more and more characters, more and more large groups/organizations that I had to keep track of and characters got lost in the shuffle. I see this same problem with Demon Slayer with its ever-expanding cast, to the point where I started losing track of characters in this show as well. Oh, there's that angry boy from the Final Selection exam, I totally forgot he was a thing! Oh, you mean there are TWO butterfly girls? I thought they were the same girl! This show was strongest when it was just about Nezuko and Tanjiro, and I remember groaning out loud when the yellow guy and the boar guy were introduced. To be fair I actually turned around quite a bit on Zenitsu and (avoiding spoilers) I'll just say you see major changes with him in the following episodes (to the point where he became my favorite character). The boar head guy never grew on me, though. It was annoying scenes with him that, again, made me wish their traveling party was smaller. 
Both art and sound are perfect 10's. I challenge you to find a better looking anime, actually! Holy crap, I don't know where studio Ufotable got the money for this thing, but the animation quality NEVER dips for the entire run of the show, and it always looks excellent! I was a little disappointed that we never got a 2nd opening theme, but honestly, if cutting something like that saved enough $ for them to anime those GORGEOUS fight scenes, then by all means! My enjoyment was a perfect 10 as well. Watch this anime if only to be wowed by the visuals. One of the best looking anime of all time!",9,WhiteWolfKiba

                I didn't think Demon Slayer was as polarizing as it was.
When I booted up MyAnimeList, I expected the general consensus to be that it had relatively weak and simple writing but great animation and the score would be somewhere in between 5-6 for most. Instead, there are a plethora of people quick to call it a top Shonen of ALL TIME or calling it not just overrated but garbage. 
Thus is the fate of many popular Shonen's. ""So which is it?"" you may ask. Well, in my opinion, it's definitely better than people give it credit for but still somehow overrated.

Story: 6
Less really is
                  more in this category. Whilst Demon Slayer is not as freakishly creative as something like JoJo's, the premise is much more akin to an anime such as FMAB, realistic settings with supernatural powers and beings contrasted by normal humans like you and me. It is very down to earth and sets a genuine and natural feeling that the main character, Tanjiro plays into perfectly. Not to discredit the story itself though which is definitely a fairly original take on the usual Shonen formula. The breathing styles allow for gorgeous, flowy animation sequences while still being defined as purely aesthetic rather than actual powers which again, plays into the feeling of the show being rooted in reality. The gore really shines through, in my opinion, by not being too overblown yet still showing us the the stakes at hand as to just how dangerous the demons are. And whilst Tanjiro doesn't share the overtly cliche ""I want to be the best (insert highest position of power)"", there is still a sort of council of powerful characters, the Hashiras, who admittedly are mostly cliché's, still set forward a clear path of progression for Tanjiro. Although there is no shortage of contrived plot holes and conveniences, the human nature of the story is what is really great about it, and its a feel that constantly reinvents itself throughout the course of the show in new ways. Is it a bit generic the way that it's done here as opposed to FMAB? Totally, but that in of itself is not enough to call the story bad.
Art: 10
One can easily put the spotlight on Koyoharu Gotouge for the unique art style and integration of ukiyo-e type drawings for the breathing styles further adding into the oriental Japanese setting aesthetic. On the other hand, it is clear that Ufotable added a great amount of their own personality on the animation as the manga looks much rougher around the edges (which, by the way is just as great when put together with the darker themes and tones of certain scenes). The animation sequences bring scenes to life like no other and the combat cinematography is nothing less than impeccable. 
Sound: 8
Yes, I know we all like LiSa's gurenge as the opening of the show, let's look past that (it is still contributing towards the score of this section though). The orchestral soundtracks in Kimetsu no Yaiba really bang and fit very well. The downside is, though, that they are not very memorable for holding unique personalities within the show. Whereas Ghibli's orchestral soundtracks often play over luscious landscapes offering a peaceful serenity, Evangelion's dreadful tracks come in with these ominous sounds, and even stuff like Kimi No Na Wa's more pop-sounding songs that are overlaid with great vocals and played over beautiful backgrounds, Kimetsu no Yaiba's soundtrack holds no footing. Especially when those gorgeous fight scenes are going on and the tracks become an afterthought rather than a complement. 
Character: 3
I don't think Kimetsu no Yaiba's characters are bad or anything but they surely aren't interesting. Many of them can be easily classified into specific character archetypes, Tanjiro especially being the most typical Shonen protagonist possible. Even their character dynamics are predictable and when the occasion calls, certain characters change their entire personality just to fit the cliché (Zenitsu goes from coward to brave protector of a BOX). And while some people love to see Tanjiro comfort the tortured souls of demons, I just find it super cheesy and melodramatic that the show tries to make us care for a character that showed almost no remorse until the end of their life by giving them a sad backstory. It's cheap and also calls into question the integrity of the Demon Slayer corps that despite these emotional showings and even some good demons, they don't try to negotiate or anything. Nezuko in particular would not be a subject of adoration by fans if she kept true to the rules the show set. She goes from trying to kill Tanjiro to protecting him which was not only played out for an emotional reaction from the audience but also coincidentally in line with Giyuu's arrival where he goes against his lifetime principals by sparing Nezuko. If she wasn't so gosh-darn adorable, she would not be as popular let alone unquestioned in the way she was written.
Enjoyment: 8
Can you ignore all of this show's antics and attempts to grab at your emotions and generic showings when it comes to the premise and enjoy the show? Well, for me, the answer is undoubtedly yes. The stunning animation and choreography puts you in a daze and if nothing else, Kimetsu no Yaiba offers a nice change in tone and realism from its recent coevals such as Boku no Hero Academia and Black Clover.
Overall, Kimetsu no Yaiba doesn't blow anything out of the water but is worth a watch. You would not want to miss one of the biggest anime of its season, after all.

                If you’re new to anime, I highly recommend you watch Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. The main storyline is simple and straightforward, but the writers have so masterfully weaved in each character’s development to fit with the gorgeous art style and animation, and it honestly ties in perfectly together. This series is also really refreshing as it focusses more so on family ties, which no other anime has been doing much of lately. A major theme being the bond between family members and siblings - think Full Metal Alchemist. Kimetsu no Yaiba does touch on the importance of fostering quality friendships, but it's done in
                  such a way that's unlike your typical run of the mill shonens. If you’re looking for a breath of fresh air, give Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba a go. - 9/10 imo",9,juicyjus

                **Minor/Minimal Spoilers Review**
In the season of the blossoming of trees and flowers, back to life! We got a little spring surprise from studio Ufotable, famous for their type-moon adaptations like the Fate series (or others like God Eater, Tales series...etc) with their great in-house staff and amazing compositing team, as they bring you Kimetsu no Yaiba! an adaptation of Koyoharu Gotouge's second manga with the same name.
A decent addition to the compact anime year of 2019!
But without further ado!
_LETS GET RIIIIGHT INTO THE REVIEWWWW!
>> Story >> 6/10
Here as we start with KnY's weakest point, the story, it is ""fine"", it is not garbage like some say, and it is not really a masterpiece like some people claim it is... 
For me personally it was painful to try liking it, KnY has a lot of strong points but it extremely lacked in giving an imaginative/creative story, it just seems like the basic boring revenge-ish Shounen story of the protagonist losing his family and starting to hunt/track the person that did it, and that person ending-up to be one of the strongest if not the strongest final ""villain"" of the story, but scrubbing off the revenge factor for most of the story ... how original...
BUT, that doesn't mean the story itself is COMPLETELY boring, the narrative moves quite smoothly, there are even some surprisingly good moments in the story that are adapted really well thanks to the great pacing early on, and the impressive storyboarding.
Still, it really doesn't help that much if the base structure of the story is nothing special, even quite tedious at times and very predictable...
>> Art/ Animation >> 9/10
Animation/Art, the thing that almost every fan praises when talking about KnY, as someone who spent almost 50% of his life talking about animation, is it great? HELL YEAH!... But is it ground-breaking or unique, not really at all, it is still really great for a 26 episodes anime...
With studio Ufotable we also get the treat that is their contract in-house animators and affiliated freelancers to the studio, and there are a lot of amazing talents in there.
A few to note, are the amazing and probably my favorite animator at Ufotable, of course I'm talking about Nozomu Abe, the person that brought you the two explosive full-of-effects kills of Zenitsu from episodes #12 and #17, and the really praised end-cut fight scene of Tanjirou in episode #19.
And we can't mention KnY's animation without talking about the man behind a lot of the big KnY confrontation, we are talking about Masayuki Kunihiro, with his sexy smears and very noticeable effects and timming, he was behind Tanjirou vs Inosuke in episode #14, which honestly surprised me of how great it moved compare to the usual fucus on art and very corrected key-frames, that fight was fairly loose with only a few stiff cuts, probably doe to that episode's storyboard. But Masayuki also did the water and fire dragon cuts in #19, the long sword cut in #07, a big chunk of the Sabito vs Tanjirou cuts in #03... and a lot more ect.
Also others like Mitsuru Obunai with his great first demon fight in #02, and thanks to all the in-house Ufotable animators that did their best and all the directors, storyboarders that gave impact to some minor scenes, and the in-betweeners and 2nd key-animators for the consistency.
BUT THE BIGGEST OF THANKS GOES TO the amazing Ufotable compositing team that brings every scene with great colors and energy, honestly I feel like the compositing teams are always forgot about, without the compositing the show wouldn't have even looked 40% as good as it does.
....
But going to the negatives that brought the score down a little, the extreme overusing of CG, rotoscoping is fine but using straight-up CG models for important scenes without even tracing over them is really jarring, fine, but the lack of background animation in this kills me, the use of 3D backgrounds, 3D camera movements and effects are overdone, some are great and creative like the use of them in episodes #12 and #13, but some are not so great, you can spot them all over, tho the 3D backgrounds can be used to convey space very well, it is a double-edged sword...
But coming back to the designs, the designs themselves aren't bad, they are decent and very animation friendly and vertacile, I don't dislike them personally, tho, one thing I really love about them is the line-art, it seems cool looking, and overall the design choices in the anime are very creative in a lot of stuff later on, especially I love the masks and cloths that some characters wear, a bit of fresh air... 
But in all honesty, the compositing is really helping this show keep consistency, plus the corrections by the animation directors/episode supervisors...
The problem is, people seem to not really know the difference between art and animation, or really great compositing, they kinda of just ignore factual information and just come-up with crap...
Overall I'm not disappointed, I expected more, knowing the staff involved early on, but it is still great nonetheless especially with that really healthy schudule, but I really hoped for a more unique take on the style.
>> Sound/ Music >> 8/10
This point is surprisingly unique, sound effects-wise, it was really good, nothing out of the ordinary but quite unique, caught me off guard sometimes even, sounds like slashing and sparks seem decent enough, and a few sounds that flow with some demons powers are really good.
Musicly, it was alright, there was only one Opening and Ending, and only one insert song, the Opening by Lisa was great and hype indosing, and the ending is good too it got even stuck in my head for a while.
Tho, the music itself by Shiina Go, which is one of my favorites, the music by him for God Eater was nothing less than amazing, tho he worked with Yuki Kajiura, which her influence on the soundtrack seems a lot stronger than Shiina's, her music choices seem very similar to that of Fate/Zero or SAO even, but I guess it wasn't that memorable to me, sorry, BUT, there are a few tracks that really caught me off guard, I feel like the thing that KnY lacks the most musically is a bit more subtlety, it feels very rock-ish and the vocals are very distracting to me, beside silence, very subtle music helps with making a scene impactful, kinda like the piano track that I liked a lot in episode #23 with Nezuko but that episode was mainly one of my favorites because of the storyboard.
At the end the music was decent, but you may like it more than I did, it did give the show a unique almost old-timey Japanese demon stories feel to it, which I guess fits well.
>> Characters >> 7/10
Here is the thing that saved but also hurt the series in my opinion, characters, the main cast seems straight forward, but they are still great, well-developed and relatable even if they lack creative construction, you got the determined, polite and passionate Tanjirou, the basic shounen MC formula, tho, he does get a little bit more interesting later on. We also got Zenitsu, the loud, pervy and scaredy-pants that actually was quite annoying at first, but I actually grew to like him, he is quite quirky with a not half-bad characterization. But here comes my favorite character in the show so far, Boar-boy also known as Inosuke, the dude reeeeally likes YEEET'ing, jk jk, but I really like him, he seems very unique and from what I heard from manga readers, his character really gets the development it deserves later on...
A lot of the pillars and villains are fairly distinctive too, even while retaining a lot of cliche Shounen characteristics, they do seem fresh and may get better as the series goes on, you gotta consider that as this is only the first season of KnY.
Tho, outside of that, lets get into the negatives, the villains are horrible... I'm not even joking... No foreshadowing, no early characterization or narrative building, not even a little of it... Outside of the main villain Kibutsuji Muzan that we don't know much about beside him being the first and strongest demon that turned Nezuko, all the other villains were a combination of boring and predictable, some were interesting but indeed up being wasted potential, sympathetic villains are important to a story, but when almost every villain is sympathetic, and not even done well, the story becomes predictable and the villains lose all their impact on the narrative...
I really hope KnY gets better on this aspect, It is one of the main things that limited my enjoyment of the series, I'm still an anime-only so I don't know what is coming...
>> Enjoyment >> 8/10
I really enjoyed the series, especially after the other characters got introduced, it was fairly fun excluding some very cringy dialogues and story routes, I especially like the comedy, some episodes were straight-up wholesome and hilarious, it is definitely a really good anime for people new to the industry or that don't know much about anime, the story is straight forward and the fight scenes are great.
>> Overall >> 7/10
Overall, it was decent and enjoyable throughout, if you're looking for a unique and interesting experience in a Shounen, this show is not it, but if you're looking to have some fun and watch an anime with your friends and family, then this is it.
I may have been harsh on it, probably for the reason of how much it was over-hyped, some people even said it should be AOTY... That really made me chuckle...
But in all seriousness, this has potential, a lot of it at that, it may get much much better if the potential is used cleverly by the author, for that I don't know, a season 2 is in most definitely coming, this was a huge hit that it even trended on Twitter...
I did like it, and I hope it gets somehow better and successeds in what it is trying to do in all respect.
**In conclusion, I hope the review was helpful to you in a way or another, sorry if I missed some points, I'm busy in college, so I just wrote this quite quick to just show how I feel about the show overall...
Thanks for putting time and reading my lazy review xD

                Its genuinely crazy how people see this as a masterpiece. When i heard about the positive reception this anime got, I was excited to watch it, but no matter how much i tried, i couldn't enjoy it for whatever reason, the artstyle only kept my interest for so long. The characters are extremely pathetic and the story is so predictable I found myself holding my eyes open as to not fall asleep mid episode. The only driving force to watch was because others really liked it.
I thought that the show would get much better at the famed 19th episode, surely it could only go up
                  from here right? I got to the 19th episode, 90% of the episode was filled with boring dialogue and then we got to the part most people talk about, the fight scene. Yes, it was beautiful and the animation was amazingly done, but that doesnt hold back any criticism, the fight consisted of 99% dialogue, 1% actual fighting, it just dragged way too long, so I dropped the show. The story is always like this, its mostly just meaningless talking and then tiny bits of actions, always dragging in each episode.
If the story was anything to go off on, the characters just plainly dont make sense and are so boring both in design and backstory. Tanjiro is the most plainest protagonist i've ever seen, his literal only motivations are ""Ill save you Nezuko"", which doesn't resonate with anyone since we only knew Nezuko for .3 seconds before she was turned into a demon. Also, the whole idea to make Nezuko like humanity was already an overused trope, but even so, they went about doing it in the absolute worst possible way. Instead of showing the conflicts of the character and actually making an arc for Nezuko to become better, she is literally lobotomized by a random demon we only see once (at least until ep20) and then never again. Nezuko likes humanity because shes brainwashed instead of actually liking them, which feels wrong and not earned, and we're supposed to just accept that. I found the 2 side characters of Inosuke and Zenitsu to be much more interesting and fun, even though they also faltered in similar areas. Tanjiros motives are bland and pretentious, his journey is more of a slideshow of events and the battle sequences are never utilized to their full potential especially with this style of animation.

                It’s very rare that a shōnen protagonists’ entire family is slaughtered, with a young boy staring in horror as he finds his disembodied mother and siblings; the only series I can think of where a similar event transpires is in Fushigi Yûgi and that’s a shōjo series! Kimetsu no Yaiba generated a lot of new paths for the shōnen genre to pass through. I would have never guessed ten years ago, during Naruto’s heyday, that manga for young boys eventually mutate into a story about a teenager trying to save his sister from turning into a murderous demon. The incorporation of demons in children’s comics
                  used to be limited to Rumiko Takahashi’s Inuyasha and nothing beyond that had really surfaced—until now.
Nezuko’s entire character subverts the idea of demons being vicious, though, in the world of Kimetsu no Yaiba, the majority are. These aren’t the yōkai of Inuyasha, who are open to engaging in dialogue with humans, but creatures that will slaughter women and children in cold blood. Before the creation of ‘Demon Slayer,’ the mangaka (Koyoharu Gotōge) made their living off of publishing horror one-shots in magazines. Their première series borrows a lot of the elements of those earlier vignettes to create a unique story that couples an atmosphere of blood-curdling, demoniac forces with the treacly undercurrent of serendipity and forgiveness.
This isn’t just a monster-of-the-week story, but a journey that actually feels like there will be a rewarding end for each character. I believe that Gotōge’s decision to have the series take place in the Taishō (1912—1926) era of Japan was perfect for the story at hand; it was a transformative time in Japanese history, post—the preceding chaos of the Meiji era (1868—1912) and pre—the militarism of the Shōwa era (1926—1989). I interpret the villain, Muzan Kibutsuji, as a representation of the mounting tensions that would lead to the infamous Shōwa—World War II—period of history; Muzan is the grand puppet master of the demons after all, not unlike the political puppeteers of that era.
Kimetsu no Yaiba is a story about the hateful demons being able to find redemption, after being the most despicable beings in existence. The protagonist, Tanjirō, is the beacon that ameliorates the demons, so that they can find ‘*karmic’ salvation. After all, denoting the topic to real life, every murderer was born a human being. I have heard elitists on the internet complain about the moments when the demons have flashbacks to their mortal life, before becoming demons; immediately afterward, they are killed by Tanjirō. Critics say that this is a cheap mechanism to make the audience feel bad for the demons, who have murdered hundreds of people in their wake.
*Relating to Saṃsāra, a Buddhist term that refers to the cycle of rebirth.
I refute that criticism because Tanjirō’s kindness is able to make them remember what it was like to be human. That’s part and parcel of the story—I understand that it has been used in other series to manipulate the audience into feeling sympathy but, in Kimetsu no Yaiba, it is pivotal to the Buddhist underpinnings of karma and reincarnation. These demons are seeking retribution for their sins; their life flashes before their eyes before they die because, prior to meeting Tanjirō, they had forgotten what it was like to be human. It is thematically relevant and if the series didn’t reveal who the demons had been, before they were corrupted by Muzan, it would defeat the purpose of the story. Two of the most heart-wrenching moments in the series were when Tanjirō defeated Kyōgai, as well as the forlorn, Mother Spider Demon.
The morality in Kimetsu no Yaiba is similar to the *Ryūkishi07 ethos of ‘people can become good or evil depending on their circumstances.’ Most of the demons became murderers because they didn’t have an opportunity to resolve certain circumstances in their lives. It’s questionable if Tanjirō would have even been able to keep it together—if Nezuko had died with the rest of his family. Tanjirō and Nezuko have a compelling relationship but, dually, a frightening dependency on each other… because what would the outcome be, if either of them died? In keeping with the morality topic, *the connection with the moon for the demons is emblematic of the yīnyáng paradigm: the moon is often associated with yīn (chaos/negativity) because of its white color and the correlation to night, whereas the sun represents yáng (order/positivity). That’s why many villains have a fixation on the moon; another example of this are the ‘Lunarians’ in Hōseki no Kuni.
*Creator of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. Muzan’s subordinates are called the ‘Demon Moons.’
I thought it was interesting that the characters use breathing techniques, like real martial artists, during their training instead of a Taoist energy reserve or some other commonly used power-up in anime. It gave the training more of a grounded feel because it was based off of something that is used for athletic competitions in real life, not some super secret magical ability. Despite the existence of demons, demon slayers like Shinobu Kōchō (who uses poison on her enemies) seem to have specialties with human limitations.
Exploration of Kimetsu no Yaiba’s *Characters:
*Not going to include the members of the Hashira (with the exception of Shinobu Kochō), since they haven’t had enough involvement in the story to analyze. The Jū ni Kizuki (the Twelve Demon Moons) won’t be included for the same reason, and the Lower Kizuki will be mentioned, sporadically, but not given individual excerpts.
—Tanjirō Kamado: I find the idea of an overly empathetic protagonist fascinating, harkening back to Will Graham from *Red Dragon. It is incredible that Tanjirō is able to reflect his honest, good-natured personality on everyone around him… even the most spiteful demons! In the anime, the script-writing exemplifies Tanjirō’s kindness—to an extent that I was baffled by his humility, given the amount of trauma he’s gone through, and was amazed that he could be so understanding of others’ pain. My interpretation of how Tanjirō grapples with the grief of losing his family, is because of his determination to give Nezuko her life as a human back; this theory is validated throughout the series, with how much he suffers when there’s complications with Nezuko’s recovery (or when she’s in danger). Without that goal, Tanjirō would probably be struggling more from the trauma of losing his family, but the distant hope of curing Nezuko emboldens him to move forward. 
*The first novel in Thomas Harris’ Hannibal series.
—Nezuko Kamado: While Nezuko’s main appeal is to be the most adorable creature in existence. She is dually compelling as a serious character with how much willpower she has; particularly, when dealing with her blood-lust. Even when Nezuko’s body and mind is altered by the transformation into a demon, it is still apparent that her love for her brother still exists. The fact that she’s willing to sleep for months (or years) to keep from harming humans is inspiring, to say the least.
—Inosuke Hashibira: Out of the four main protagonists, I personally thought that Inosuke was the weakest. The internet’s darling, a spirited bishōnen—disguised as a madman. It’s impossible not to enjoy his seiyū, *Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, randomly belting out throaty laughs and rolling his tongue like a yakuza. He’s overzealous, competitive, and wild—having been raised in the woods. He often feels slighted by Tanjirō, because he won’t acknowledge him as a rival.
*Famous for his roles as Kazuto Kirigaya (Kirito) from Sword Art Online, Sōma Yukihira from Shokugeki no Sōma, and Petelgeuse Romanée-Conti from Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu.
—Zen'itsu Agatsuma: Zen'itsu is disliked in the West but tops the character polls in Japan (having almost even beat Tanjirō once for first place). He’s one of my personal favorites because he brings levity to serious situations and, doubly, brings to light how absurdly awful the reign of ravenous demons is. It’s like having a contemporary teenage boy screaming when he sees demons eating people on the street. Is it any wonder why he’s afraid of that? Zen'itsu is a scaredy cat but he has a reason to be; people who come out of those frightening situations unscathed, like Tanjirō or Inosuke, are far more unusual—pragmatically. As far as Zen'itsu womanizing goes, I didn’t find it offensive and there was humor gleaned from the gratification of him getting spurned. He is often sensible in certain situations, and has a hidden side that deeply cares for his friends, like when he asked Tanjirō if he was going to be alright in the last scene of *Episode 26.
*Episode 26: New Mission (改める任務)
—Shinobu Kōchō: The weakest of the Hashira, strength-wise, but excels in stealth and poisoning skills (hence her ‘insect’ motif, subsequently, the kanji used to spell Kōchō means ‘butterfly’). She carries on the legacy of his sister, Kanae Kōchō, who was tragically killed by a demon. Before her sister was murdered—Shinobu was haughty, impatient, and quick to temper but since her sister asked her to ‘always smile,’ she plasters on a smile despite feeling anger and resentment towards the demons. Even with Tanjirō, who peels off the superfluidity of those around him, she refuses to let her guard down.
—Kanao Tsuyuri: A tsugokū (disciple) to the Hashira, personally mentored by Shinobu Kochō—Kanao was rescued by Shinobu and his sister, Kanae Kōchō, but is subsequently broken because she lived an impoverished life with abusive parents and has residual trauma because of her childhood. She’s unable to feel emotions normally and because of her slave-upbringing, she is too afraid to make decisions for herself. Kanao cannot properly communicate effectively and is absent-minded, but despite this—Tanjirō’s kindness reaches her and she begins to develop feelings for him, after living a life of numbness and compliancy.
*Even worse, said parents sold her into slavery.
—Muzan Kibutsuji: The main antagonist. A ruthless, narcissist that rules the Demon Moons with an iron fist. Coinciding with the moon motif, disguised as a human, Muzan goes by Tsukihikō—meaning ‘moon prince,’ the character 月 (tsuki) means ‘moon’ and 彦 (hikō) means ‘prince.’ His self-centered nature even coincides with Shinto legend of Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto, the male moon god, who was shunned by his sister, the *sun goddess, after killing Ōgetsu-hime (the kami of food) out of disgust. Muzan is reminiscent of Naraku from Inuyasha and Adam Weishaupt from Senki Zesshō Symphogear, with his aura of unfettered evil; he creates a multiplicity of demons, by feeding them his blood, like a vampire.
*Amaterasu-ōmikami, or simply Amaterasu (天照)
The anime adaptation has gorgeous visuals, famous seiyū (with fantastic vocal direction), bombastic directing, and a beautifully composed OST—including the vocal talents of LiSA with her hit-songs:  ‘Gurenge’ (紅蓮華 Red Lotus) as the OP and her collaboration with *FictionJunction, ‘From the Edge.’ The action scenes were a combination of (1) dynamically cool and (2) campy, there are scenes that are laughable because tiny-bodied Nezuko will just jump up and kick a demon’s head off with her super strength! Ufotable also experimented with spacial orientation a lot, an example of this was *when Tanjirō was fighting Kyōgai, the demon that used tsuzumi drums, and spacial perception was traversed because of the drums ability to shift the dimensions of the room. This happened again in *Episode 26, in Muzan’s headquarters—a demon realm, erected by a demoness with a biwa. Based off of M.C. Escher’s trompe-l'œil painting ‘Reality (1953),’ this realm’s direction shifts because there are conjoining stairways on all sides; Ufotable uses dutch angles to create a sensory experience of otherworldliness. 
*FictionJunction is a group that solely performs songs written by Japanese composer, Yuki Kajiura. Episode 13: Something More Important Than Life (命より大事なもの). Episode 26: New Mission (改める任務). 
Overall, Kimetsu no Yaiba is a beautifully orchestrated series that’s heavily entrenched in Eastern mythology. The heaviness is often extinguished by refreshing humor that focuses a character’s absurd personality, namely Zen'itsu and Inosuke. The series is a celebration of Japanese folklore, perseverance, love, and retribution. A show that is breaking the mold for shōnen, a genre that seems to be incorporating more and more seinen elements into its publications. I rate ‘Demon Slayer’ a 8/10!",8,EggheadLuna

                I'll let you know on a Taisho secret: This anime is pretty good.
Even though the story itself is nothing special and, the enormous budget this show clearly had allowed for the animation, character design for allies and enemies alike and fight sequences to look beautiful. It is the superb production value that takes this anime to the next level - and a worthy new shounen to invest your time in. 
The story is very much what you would expect - MCs family is murdered by demons, he wants to get revenge, kill his first demon, finds a sensei, fights and defeats stronger and stronger demons
                  while being constantly reminded that he is not strong enough... (following the monomyth structure almost to the word). Only Nezuko stands as a refreshing change to the genre. HOWEVER - somehow, it all grows on you as you go on with the story. You start to like the characters and chemistry between them (Zenitsu was super annoying at first tho), the worldbuilding, the antagonist and especially the humor which for me was a high point. 
 A promising start to a new shounen and I honestly can't wait for the movie and new seasons further on. Definitely check this one out - and don't take massive popularity of this anime as a detergent.",9,Raquityn

                Demon Slayer's adaptation by Ufotable was a masterfully embellished sword whose blade was forged by a novice blacksmith, either using all the wrong materials or straight-up skipping out on them.  
Just a month ago is when I got around to this community-shattering piece. It's been a while since a show has split the community like Demon Slayer, and while there are always fans and haters, I found myself wanting to be a fan, though it proved nothing worthy of that title. Its narrative knows nothing of character writing or consistent tone and presentation, displaying lazy writing and cheap shortcuts. Within the pursuit of being
                  cool and hype, while reached, the creators stifled everything else, tumbling down into a mediocre end product. 
On tone inconsistency, why would Inosuke and Zenitusu even be conceptualized for a series like this? Early episodes proved heavy, gritty, and engaging. Adding characters who cried, whimpered, or screamed for every second of their screentime for the rest of the show for ""comedy"" purposes destroyed everything previously built. Adding those two shattered its command for an image as something more serious, leaving me stoic and pained. The only thing that got me smiling was the ""Nezuko-Chan!"" only because I was so relieved that it was ANYTHING but crying from that stupid bright yellow turd. Any scene that would've been good became tossed into the bin because of the comedy that must be present in every moment. The art-style change that occurred at every joke did not help either. The way the smooth, bold lines and rough details would disappear during those moments to make way for some stupid funny face slowly culminated into more distaste for the show. 
Now for characters, I'll ignore Zen and Ino because I already mentioned that their telos and essence are to be annoying, and I'll talk about the main two, Nezuko and Tanjiro. They're both where you can find this writing laziness. Nezuko's whole concept is that she's a demon, but unlike other ones, she has self-control. The problem with this idea is how that self-control/restraint is acquired. Nezuko had it given to her. I'll let the whole ""Remember me? I'm your family"" moment pass because it's a common trope, but the whole hypnosis thing is pure writer negligence. Nezuko is the entire reason this story flows. If she had not become a demon or died, Tanjiro wouldn't be hunting down a cure, and the show would be completely different or completely cease. Why would you destroy such a prominent character? If you were to have her muzzled up and tucked away after some development, that'd be all right, but it's completely glossed over. An entire little arc could've been, showing how resilient Nezuko is through honing her mind and body over time to control her innate desire for human blood and flesh, but no. She went to sleep for a while and became hypnotized to believe ""human good, demon bad,"" and it took nothing to do so. A story that prides itself in its struggle and hardship, handing out free passes to a main character, the one the entire plot is revolving around. 
Another free pass is Tanjiro's power. While I do like his personality, his writing is also lazy. Within an episode's time, he goes from brand new to fully trained. He went from no sword skills to all water forms within no time. I could accept the breathing and agility because it showed that, but how'd he master water styles besides sitting under the waterfall? The only swordplay shown was him swinging it overhead and slapping that boulder. The water wheel technique Tanjiro is always using was never shown in training. Any shounen has it when they have a sort of signature move. Anything in Hajime no Ippo shows Ippo working in the gym honing the techniques. After seeing him work and finally pull off the thing he's been working for in a match, you're satisfied. Having payoff without work isn't a payoff rather, it is a convenience, handing over flashy moments that don't leave their intended impacts, leaving me flat. 
Another occurrence without work is the fire stuff in ep 19. What? Did the author pigeohole himself and came up with the backstory then? A sudden power boost had to emerge after exhausting the breathing stuff, and boom, it came, the power of friendship/family. Of course. I had hopes that it'd be different, that it would at least avoid this. I understand family is a big topic the story revolves around, but it came off as undeserved and Deus-ex Machina-esque. It was the climax of the season. Why did he get some convenient revelation? I know it's because he was searching through memories. After all, he nears death, and Shinobu hinted at that hypothesis earlier, but it doesn't make it any less of what would be pure luck. With this, it's clear the author intends to have only shock value and wow moments. Quick dopamine stingers that you see, then say, ""Wow, that was cool,"" then forget. 
Once again, I'm brought around to the tone/presentation. It falls the more I think about it. Tanjiro is supposed to be a hard worker, but that work isn't there. I have to imagine what he did myself. If I wanted to make pictures in my mind, I'd read a book, but a book would still have to tell me what he did. In the beginning, when Tanjiro tricks Tomioka with the axe play, it would hint at strategy and tactics, but nope, that was scrapped and never seen again. Fights, while flashy and fast-paced, felt weightless. It might be the whole point since Tanjiro uses a water style and everyone uses a katana, but I'd like to mention it. 
All right, while I can go on and about flaws, the show still has its merits. Coming out of Ufotable, the quality is there as expected, and it's the best-looking show they've done yet. It's vivid, crisp, and bold, with my favorite shot being after the final selection. The scene as the remaining participants stand together with the pink cherry blossoms, the bright blue sky, and the colors of their coat-type attire like green, white and yellow all paint this beautiful image. It had me pause and stare at it, displaying excellent color composition. The animation, of course, is smooth, and while I diss the water wheel as a concept, it was one of the best looking forms Tanjiro had besides the wavy s looking one and the one he used to kill the mom.
The cinematography showed some cool shots during fights, staying nice and simple the rest of the time. The aesthetic choice in ancient Japan was a great one. The outfits, the katana stuff, and the whole farming look were refreshing. Also, the music with those flutes and traditional instruments sounded so nice.
Another good aspect is the villains, simple and effective. I loved that big blob guy and his story. Imprisoned on the mountain, he murders the students of his capturer to have his revenge. It was great and exciting to see him. Rui was cool but didn't have much of a presence, to be honest. 
The Hashira are also sick af as I've heard they are an inspiration from the Soul Society guys in Bleach, a show rich with cool. A great choice to draw inspiration. Tanjiro while he's flawed from a writing standpoint, is still loveable and refreshing with his affinity toward letting his emotions out making him feel much more human. 
Things like this are where my dilemma of rating Demon Slayer comes into play, and I call back the claim of ""masterfully embellished."" The production value is stunning, but if it's behind unequal material, it's only disappointing, having you wonder what better works this effort could've been put into. Demon Slayer was definitely really cool, but its sacrifices to get there outweigh the factor heavily. My enjoyment matters most, but the critic inside cannot ignore any of this, lowering that enjoyment score by a lot. 
This review will be posted as a 6/10, but on my list, it could easily slip into 5/10. I understand that this is only the beginning. With the movie hopefully coming to the US soon and promises of season 2 coming out later in 2021, both look to expand the world much more. I hope things will improve then. Arrivederci! :)",6,wachow

                One way to describe Kimetsu no Yaiba is ""predictable yet interesting"". 
How come? Well, the studio does a spectacular job with the art and sounds, the fighting scenes in particular are enthralling and several flashbacks brought me to tears; however, the story and the characters were so poorly constructed that in the end, and despite the fact that I did have fun, I can't in all honesty give it more than 6 stars.
Tanjiro is a likeable, but sadly flat, character. He displays all the typical traits of shounen heroes, what with being a protective and kind brother who is always looking out for his sister
                  and who consistently helps the weak and fights evil doers. His demon sister does not eat humans, something only she can do for some reason. Instead of some impressive character development, she literally has no voice and is usually used as a plot device to magically ""power up Tanjiro"" despite having so much potential. I don't think I need to go into too much detail; we all know this trope. 
Zenitsu and Inouske exist for comic relief, and attempts to give their characters dimensions fail on all fronts.

                The first time I heared about Kimetsu no Yaiba was from my friend. At that time I don’t really interested in nowadays anime. One thing I noticed about this anime was the premise of the story as same as usual Shounen Jump anime. Well at that time I really hate the Isekai type of anime, so I thought Kimetsu no Yaiba will be the same. Along the way I watched retro anime, Kimetsu no Yaiba is getting more popular, until I realize that everyone is watching Kimetsu no Yaiba now, what’s so good about this anime? Then I decided to watch this anime.
I placed my
                  expectation not too high for this anime, because this anime is so popular and I believe that everything that goes viral will be bad for me. Come to the first episode. The timeline is set to Sengoku Era (1493-1573) which is the time of the Samurai. I can feel it in the first episode, how the situation of Traditional Japan at that time. The premise is Kamado Tanjirou wants to save his lovely sister Kamado Nezuko who turns into Oni (Devil) that eats human to live. I could feel the spirit and the struggle that Tanjirou had to face. Ran down from the mountain while the snow rain is so heavy. Makes my heart felt so excited, The story itself contains struggle, darkness and sadness along the way Kamado Tanjirou did his main objective. Though the story is dark and intense, it won’t be perfect for the Shounen Jump if there’s no comedy. The comedy will be found after Tanjirou meets other people, made it really Shounen Jump type of Anime. Placed in perfect time for me personally because I’m so tired watching Kimetsu no Yaiba fight against Oni all the time. So the Comedy really saved their enjoyment of watching. Story developing is really fast, it felt like playing RPG game and you don’t realize that you have already at the Big Boss. Because of it, they’re often give a scene of Tanjirou’s training, I don’t know if it’s worked for you, but for me it was good that they’re noticed it.
Comes up to the art I noticed a lot of lighting setting. They make the ambience of the enviroments using it, for example on the first episode they use the blue color a lot, because the situation is snowy. I don’t know how their animator and editor works but when the lighting is placed on the dark environment, it will be very dark, I complained about this, because it is so bothering my experience of watching, color grading can be too dark or too bright. Until I realized that the use of dark lighting is to emphasize the effect of fighting. Not martial art but the effect of the Power. For example Blue for water technique of Tanjirou. The color is so strong and made my eyes follow the movement of the effect. In the dark place a little of bright will be brightest, yeah that happens in Kimetsu no Yaiba.",9,ChounoRyoku

                Here is my two rules with Anime. If you can pull off ONE episode that is PERFECTION and NOT one episode that is a complete flop, I give you a 10.
Not ONE PERSON can deny that episode 19 was PERFECTION. 
The following episode steals away the power from it BUT if this is any indication of where this show is going... I can't not give it a 10. This is only for season 1.
The story is being carried by the artists, the characters are being carried by the voice actors.

                TL;DR Save yourself the trouble and watch Phantom Blood instead.
I am absolutely baffled by this show being as highly rates as it is. Yeah, the animation is cool sometimes, but the story, characters, and writing are lackluster at best. At worst, it's a complete and utter ripoff of parts 1-2 of Jojo. Let's start with what is in my opinion the most important aspect of a show, the characters.
CHARACTERS
I don't have much to say about most of them. They're pretty generic. Zenitsu and Inosuke get some hinting at maybe having a character arc towards the end of the show, but we don't actually get to
                  see that arc yet. They at least are kind of fun, though. 
Tanjiro, on the other hand, is as boring as they come. Imagine Jonathan Joestar, except he doesn't have Dio to act as his foil and his one character trait, being a gentleman, is toned down to the point it's barely noticeable most of the time. Also, he doesn't have an arc at all, his ideals are never challenged, he never loses, and he's never wrong. I had a hard time caring about him or even paying attention whenever he was the main character involved in a fight.
Nezuko. UGH. The only main female character in the show so far, and she has no agency whatsoever. She doesn't even talk. They other characters talk all the time about how she ""chose"" not to eat humans, and how she's making her own choices, but that's not true. She was hypnotized into not wanting to eat humans, and she never does anything unless another character tells her to do it. She just exists to jump in and save Tanjiro when he's in a bind. Because she never talks and barely does anything on her own, she's got even less of a personality than Tanjiro does.
Muzan Kibustuji, despite his overly long name, is actually kind of interesting. That scene where he's in the maze-like room, testing a group of his demon operatives is genuinely my favorite thing in the whole show. Unfortunately we don't know much about him and we aren't told what his motivation is, so aside from that single scene, there's not much reason to care whether he wins or loses.
ART
The animation is good when it feels like being good. Yes, I love the way the elemental breathing powers are animated, but it doesn't happen often enough for me to watch the show just for that. You could just watch a youtube compilation of all the moments where someone uses their powers and get just as much enjoyment out of that as you would from watching this whole show.
SETTING
Basically nonexistent. The best thing about these shows with element-based magic systems is how they create cultures and societies around each element. Like ATLA, where there's a nation for each bending technique. Or Naruto, with different villages for the different fighting styles. So I was expecting something like that for Demon Slayer. I was sorely disappointed. The setting is accurate to feudal Japan. But that completely ignores that demons and breath powers exist. Like, if people had these crazy breathing powers and demons roamed around everywhere, are you honestly telling me feudal Japan would be exactly the same as it is without those things? I don't think so. 
Not to mention the fact that most villagers somehow don't know about the existence of demons. How can that be possible? And how does the Demon Slayer Corps recruit as many people as it does if nobody knows they exist?
PLOT
Tanjiro goes where he's told to go. That's it. That's the main driving force of the plot. Sure, he's searching for Muzan also, but since we don't know where Muzan is (and for awhile we don't even know who he is) there's no concrete destination for Tanjiro to head towards, which makes all his travels seem like he's just floundering around, searching for plot threads at random. The fights weren't quite fun or unique enough to keep me interested when the plot is going nowhere and the characters are boring.
Still, let me summarize the plot for you real quick: A young boy's family is killed and his sibling turns into a demon that eats humans. This boy goes on a journey to cure his sister. Along the way he learns a magical breathing technique and fights some wacky villains. 
Sound familiar? It should, because it's nearly IDENTICAL to part 1 of Jojo. The only difference is Jonathan wants to kill his vampire brother, while Tanjiro wants to save his demon sister. I realize I have some intense Jojo brainrot, but hear me out, because the similarities don't end here.
MAGIC SYSTEM
The magic system works like this: If you breathe a certain way, you can enhance your body's strength, which boosts your attack or heals you. It's one of the only things that can hurt demons. Also, it has to do with your blood flow. 
Gee, that's totally NOT hamon. This magic system is almost directly ripped from Jojo, even down to the details. The original type of concentration breathing is sun breathing. Guess what? Hamon is ""identical to the energy of the sun."" At one point Tanjiro trains to learn how to use concentration breathing 100% of the time. Y'know. The exact same thing the Joseph does when he's training in Battle Tendency. There's even a line in the dub where Tanjiro says ""I need to kick my breathing into OVERDRIVE.""
Speaking of totally plagiarized magic systems, let's talk about demons and how they're functionally identical to Jojo's vampires. Demons/vampires can be ""turned"" by being given the blood of another demon/vampire, they both have two sharp front teeth, they need to eat humans to survive, they each have some sort of elemental fighting technique that they are a master of, they both die in sunlight, and they both can be killed by some sort of sunlight-based breathing technique.
This is not to say that Jojo had a totally original magic system in parts 1-2. Hamon is pretty generic, and many of the vampire powers are things that already existed in general vampire lore. But Jojo does much more creative things with hamon that Demon Slayer does with concentration breathing (which is a stupid name). Not to mention Jojo having much more to offer when it comes to interesting characters and fun, silly fight scenes. Demon Slayer is trying to be this cool, action shonen but all it does is recreate things that already exist without understanding what made those things work in the first place.

                AMAZING SHOW!!! The plot of this show is so unique and awesome. The art is perfect, in my opinion and the music/soundtrack also fits perfectly to each scene. I am in love with all of the fight scenes as each one shows a unique display of fighting styles and powers. Some of the characters like nezuko and tanjiro I love because we get to watch them develop their skills. Even though a lot of people like him, I am not a huge fan of Zenitsu because even though he can be powerful, he gets annoying at times. Overall, it was a very easy anime to
                  watch and I felt the show was colorful. I cant wait for season 2!!",9,xdiogo630
38000,"
                It is not necessarily a bad thing if I take a bit of a break from watching an anime, but the reason why I do so may give some insight into the quality of anime itself. I fell behind watching Demon Slayer with my anime club, and definitely did not have the desire to finish it before first catching up on Fire Force, that was obvious.
It seemed like such a slog to get back into the slow pace and coming close to over-explaining certain points. And finding out about the annoying comedy as a balance to the flat overall tone of the show was not
                  exciting for me as I got into the middle of the series. There is a lot to work on. The pacing of the show can be so slow without really explaining anything new about what is actually going on. The characters and structure of the show are also not aligned. I really enjoyed the moments with Tanjiro and Zenitsu's histories with their masters, and thought they could have been a nice parallel to start the show off before they cross paths, but in both cases they are thrown aside about as quickly as possible. It's like the show only wants to be in the fight monster-learn tragedy about it-kill monster-break structure as quickly as possible and it only remains in that gear for the whole show.
There is enough variety on display to at least make it work. Tanjiro is determined to cure his sister, but it is not his only personality trait or paired with a self-righteousness about how great he is. So he works as the main character, and the monsters and situations are interesting given how Tanjiro learns to overcome obstacles. And the art and animation during the Breathing techniques is always a real treat to see. Enough goes on to keep me interested to the end of the anime, but it all becomes so predictable.",6,thestarsailor

                The Anime is amazing . From the very first Episode , the Art was astounding , with every detail set into the characters' movements during their Adventures and Battles and their design , along with the backgrounds of the sceneries. As well as The Music that we get greeted with from our LiSA in the Opening and the Soundtrack along the amazing Fights. The story is not dissappointing at all , the presence of comic relief side to side with the drama from the battles between the humans and demons balances the Theme that is given.

38000,"
                My enjoyment of this anime hinged entirely on the quality of animation. Ufotable brought everything to the table to bring this series to life in a way that it is decidedly not on paper. The animation and sound design of Kimetsu no Yaiba is, without doubt, one of the best this year. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the story, characters, or overall themes of this series. But that fault lies with the author, who, in the last arc of the series in the manga, has continuously failed to give this series any real lasting impression.
The most concise summary of Kimetsu no Yaiba is
                  this: Magi meets Owari no Seraph, poorly. It aspires to the level of narrative coherence and compact seriousness that Magi delivered, and the universal question of human existence that Owari no Seraph struggles with, but comes up short on both. The blame for this can mostly be attributed to the fact that KnY lacks a complex antagonist and true narrative goal for its protagonists to struggle with. Tanjirou faces battle after battle without ever really questioning his motive to fight. Yes, revenge is a motivating factor. But there has to be more to a character than that. For Tanjirou, a character whose entire personality and growth hinges on his morals, to never face a moral question? To never question the path his morals have led him down? That's worse than mediocre shounen writing. Even a series as basic as Bleach managed to have its characters engage with the question of whether or not they were on the ""right"" side. Tanjirou faces none of that, and so each and every fight falls flat and meaningless when looked at within the scope of the whole narrative. 
Like Owari no Seraph, KnY lays out the premise that the story's supernaturally evil creatures (vampires in Owari no Seraph, demons in Kimetsu no Yaiba) are essentially human. Outside of a select few powerful individuals, the vampires and demons of each respective series and forced to become as such against their will. From here, Demon Slayer departs narrative cohesion and - while simultaneously acknowledging the innate humanness of its demons - treats them almost like the titans of Attack on Titan. Once again, however, this is done poorly. The titans of AoT are treated as categorically inhuman, incomprehensible. Kimetsu no Yaiba's demons get both treatments at the same time: both innately human and incomprehensibly evil. Should be killed with prejudice, but also sometimes can be allies re: Tamayo. Tamayo, as an aside, is a narrative anomaly. There should either be several more demons like her, or none at all, considering the number of demons that exist in KnY's world. But Tamayo is the least glaring problem in the series. Muzan being a villain without vision and Tanjirou a moral protagonist without a moral struggle far outrank her on the problem scale. 
So yes, this series is a treat to watch, but ONLY to watch. It's a blessing (and possibly entirely intentional...) that Ufotable only animated up to the Demon Train arc.",5,twigssss

                I rarely log in onto this plataform, i just had to do it so i can make some reviews from some animes that i have been watching lately, specificaly on those who are seasonal. Kimetsu no Yaiba was the reason why i log onto this site once more because i had to dedicate some words to this anime, and is one of those who has the potential to become mainstream over the people who rarely watch anime and only watch mainstream shows like shingeki or boku no hero academia, but what differences this anime over the other is that this one is made well close
                  to perfection.
Story 9/10
The story is pretty standard for the shounen genre, a guy has an objective and collectible we start to see him growing and defeating anything on his path. What makes this story more interesting than the others is the fact that the MC is not badass or a complete failure that afterwards became op, but the character we see we can actually represent ourselves in it in a badass way. What complement the simple story of the show is the MC and the supporters.
Animation and Artstyle 10/10
Last season we had one punch man season 2 which was one of the biggest dissapointments in animation related, since season 1 was so good. Kimetsu no Yaiba literally is the oposite from this: The art direction, the animation, the correct use of CG is so fluid and exquisite to watch that is hard to complain about anything. 
Sound and Music 10/10
Probably 99% of the reviews on this list are relating most of this topics to episode 19 and i cant argue with them because it was an amazing episode (probably the best episode i have seen so far in anime) . The ambientation and the sound effects of the swords, the demon abilities, the opening, the ending, and of course episode 19 late OST makes the ambientation just perfect, the feeling of the context just feels right with the music.
Character 9/10
The reason why i dont give this category a 10/10 is because for my perspective there is still lot more characters to see, the main character is probably the best mc i have seen this year: simple but relatable. The supports that he manages to meet in his travel are also good and them demons have their own personalities well built. Everything seems alive and any character that appears in the show feels like it has one purpose other than just being as an extra.
Enjoyment 9.5/10
They know how to start an episode and end it in a way that we, as a viewer, can appretiate what we witnessed and whats to come, so the suspens is there in the air for whats next. This is one of the best factors i have seen this year in any anime.

                Demon Slayer is a enjoyable show but it doesn't do anything great. I enjoyed watching the series, but none of the characters really stood out to me. The story is alright, nothing too special. Tanjiros quest to turn his sister from a demon back into a human is an interesting concept, but doesn't go the extra mile with the story. I know the show isn't finished so I won't bash the story too much because it's not concluded and the potential is very high. With what we have from the story so far, it's an interesting concept but a concept isn't what people watch for.
                  Even with mediocre story and characters, Demon Slayer does have some saving features. The art and animation is very unique and helps create an interesting environment. The animation and art style do carry the show. I would recommend Demon Slayer to anyone whos a big fan of very polished and nice looking animation. I feel like someone could watch the entire show just for that aspect and won't feel let down. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who enjoys characters and plot over everything else. You will be disappointed with how bare bones the series is when it comes to that. Taking into the fact that this show isn't finished, I could see that as a turn off. The movie and second season could possibly do the story and characters justice and turn Demon Slayer into a fairly well made anime. As for now, the only aspect that's any good is the art.",6,Kreepy_Karl

                It was a lot of fun and so pretty!! :D
Ehm let's see.. Things I didn't like:
- Zenitsu was annoying at first, but he grows on you in time!
- The boar-guy is meh.
- I don't care for Nezuko's design throughout most of the series. What's up with that mouthpiece?
- I don't care for the hashiramas; they're too eccentric for my liking. Anime gotta anime, I suppose.
- Sometimes, there's a jarring disconnect between character motivations, the setting (which is both semi-modern and feudal somehow) and how demons are treated. Some treat it as a serious issue (and it seemingly is), but many don't seem to know of
                  their existence at all, somehow.
That said, there is a lot to like! The story is simple, but it works; main character has a tragic past and goes out to avenge his family by slaying all the demons! But they tell it in an interesting way, with quickly-paced beautifully-animated montages, continuous action, cliffhangers and more!
I like how the main character, Tanjiro, both knows what needs to be done, but is also compassionate and a hard worker. He can be quite inspirational!
There's a few good laughs and a few odd moments, certainly scenes that could be scrapped or changed, but I think the total carry comes from the breathtaking visuals; whether it's the environment, cgi, choreography, general action, the designs, or all of the above! Also, the soundtrack generally fits the mood very well, and some themes are quite hype.
If there is something to learn from this, it's the following: praise Ufotable!",9,CrusaderElly

                it was interesting. The demons were nicely designed. I feel some things could have been explained better some things seemed a little weird and some of the characters felt a bit much to me. Also was pretty colorful so many colors the 
fights were not bad tho some of the effects looked a little cheap to me.
The plot was ok tho some of it I did not fully get.
the attacks and their names were creative.
It also had a good balance of funny and frightening and did not go overboard on anything. Well almost there were some moments that seemed a bit much.

                I just keep this review short.
This anime is good really good, even from the recipe itself (Ufotable + shounen jump + Lisa) already tell that if this anime didnt go to wrong direction it will become instant classic.
Likeable MC ✓ (Tanjiro is Kind but not wimp beta kind that stupidly forgive a murderer, he knew the demon is suffering too but he didnt outright forgive them n call the day, he slay them n pay respect to them. And He's not lusting his lil sis this is the biggest point)
Likeable Heroine ✓ (Nezuko cute n not useless)
Likeable side character ✓
Likeable Antagonist ✓
Good Storyline ✓ (there is no excesive filler)
Great Animation ✓ (as expected of ufotable, they like flexing their animation)
Great Soundtrack ✓ (Great OP ED, great theme song, hell everything in here is eargasm)
Overall one of the must watch anime...
Many hate this anime just because this anime become mainstream and reach many normies, but don't listen to the hater just watch it first n then judge it later",9,_Dreamfall_

It's just animation. Villains are shit. the protagonist is a door and the only thing that works in this crap is Zenitsu and Inosuke.
It's a generic battle shonen with slightly above average animation (Ufotable does better with Fate), there's nothing more than that, the script is crap and the dramatization is hilarious for being too bad.
Worst of all is the fanbase forcing this shit like it's the best anime in the world because of some scenes with colored lights. Get out of the bubble and stop forcing this generic shonen like divine animation because of colored lights.
it gets to be very funny because the fans
                  just force the animation of this shit, and there's nothing to talk about other ""qualities"".",2,Haru_Kobuchizawa

                This one came out last year 2019 Spring. 26 episodes and it literally just blew everyone’s mind. Probably one of the greatest animations made ever imo.
The gist of the story is that the protagonist, Tanjiro’s family gets attacked by demons, with one survivor - Nezuko, his sister. Who turns out has turned into a demon. The story continues and Tanjiro goes on a path to become a demon slayer with his demon sister Nezuko. Very generic plot, but the director was able to make it the anime of the year.
The cinematography is incredible, literally. The “camera angles'' will blow your mind. The Shōnen fight scene
                  choreography, I haven't seen anything like it before... Ufotable did fate/stay night unlimited blade works etc, which did have incredible battle scenes but nothing compared to demon slayer. I can’t wait to see how those evolve in the new season. One of the most visually appealing shows I have ever seen.
The story starts off lacking humour and completely adventure driven in the first half of the season. Each ep was fantastic and the story kept at a fast pace with it unfolding steadily. Some people are hating on the show because of the story line being typical. But aren't all stories pretty much repetitive?
Although it is now one of my favourite animes, the first season lacked character development and characters back story. Several things are left unexplained. Why does tanjiro have a great sense of smell? Why the hell does Zenitsu fall asleep and become a beast? Especially zenitsu and inosuke, what happened to their history ? Who are they/ I hope next season unfolds some of this.
My favourite episode of the season was probably when Inosuke and Tanjiro and Zenitsu were training with Shinobu, the most incredible battle? Refer to ep 19.",9,judysenpai

                For those that have been watching anime for a long time: in this series you will not find anything new. It´s a classic shonen, male character, a past that will be revealed at some point, and powers.
But besides having all the fun of that genre, the powers go without explaining anything, and every battle outcome and plot twist can be seen from a mile away if you are used to the genre.
So, to sum up, it´s very fun to watch, it´s addictive, but nothing new under the sun.
I´m sure it´s very attractive to newer generations, but for the old folks here, it´s the same old
                  story. Still, if you are reading this to decide, to see the reason for all the fuss, go watch it, it´s not a waste of time at all and it has room to improve in the coming seasons.",7,Allen1351

                After watching this anime I give it a lot of thought. That's why I am writing a late review. As much as I want to love this anime, I am unable to.
What I like:
It's pretty obvious that the art and animation is fantastic. The VA is pretty good and the music has a very ancient and mysterious feel to it. The fight sequences are awesome. Overall the aesthetics are visually appealing. 
What I didn't like:
The story is very mediocre. If it were not for the animation and art it would have been a really bad anime. Its story is nothing new. The main character's qualities
                  are so over used in this kind of genre that it's very annoying. He is a good boy who wants to save everybody or is some kind of a fool. Where have we seen this? In every shounen anime(naruto, hunterXhunter, BHA, One piece etc).
Some of the MC's hidden abilities is his superhuman sense of smell. It's not explained but I thought they were going for some hidden plot twist truth so I won't be talking about them. 
This anime is so focused on the fights that the characters become unimportant. All the demons that the MC fights have some kind of backstory but I thought they were out of place because of its focus on fights. 
There is very minimum character development. I thought the motivations of the MC wasn't that strong. Later on it kinda dilutes and we too only want to watch the action.
There is some unnecessary dialog and some plot holes. 
*MAJOR SPOILER*
About the plot hole, if you could hypnotize demons why didn't they try it before? 
Why can't Nezuko speak? Why have that bamboo in her mouth?
Why does the MC want to save Nezuko? She is pretty well right now as she doesn't need food, is immortal and is super string. I felt they tried to explain it near the end of the series. The MC feels that at some point he will go old and die. That will make Nezuko sad because she will be alone. So he needs to make her human again. I felt that was very selfish of him. Should she be one to decide that?
So it's kinda fun but is also lacks in major areas.",7,xxHydronxx

                Demon slayer is a pleasant surprise to come out the shonen genre, and it feels much more refined compared to its recent counter parts (MHA, Fire Force). and dulls out some of the major aspects that are found within the genre. By this I mean it glosses over aspects that would just expand an episodes run time, instead of the meandering over it for multiple episodes.
Story: 3
The story is as mediocre as it gets with interesting, but overplayed elements (main character protecting ___ family member). I wish that they explored the demons more and the universe that surrounds these characters. My biggest complaint of this
                  being, in the final episode on of the characters mentions ""oh the government doesnt recognize demon slayers so we should keep quiet"" or something. This is just an inexcusable aspect to ignore when building a universe as around episode 10 they are in a city with their swords drawn and being prosecuted by police. Just a very odd choice that shows a lack in world building that seems quite easy to establish.
Art: 10 
As anything made by Ufotable. the art is absolutely stunning and each frame has incredible detail. The CGI is done better than most shows and doesn't take away from the show. The fights in this show are consistent and truly incredible, the fight vs. Rui is probably one of the best done fights in anime, from a visual standpoint. 
Character: 6
I like most of the characters  a bit more than average (except Zenitsu). The main character is quite likable as you want him to succeed in his goals and ambitions. 
Character Design: 10
Im not sure how to put it but I just love the character design in this show. The best way for me to put it would be refined and inspired
Overall: 8
I would definitely recommend Demon Slayer as it is an entertaining show and im quite excited for season 2",8,Icyfoil

Kimetsu no Yaiba has creative visuals, quirky style and simple premise that works very effectively. The hashiras are literally the coolest guys ever. However, my main issue is that the pacing and villains of totally blow.
Demon Slayer has really weird pacing decisions - the fights stretch on like 30 chapters and the in-between ark pauses are barely there. In other shounen shows writers use pauses and long arks to explore contextual tangents, build up tension, create drama, and rise stakes. That way they create an illusion of a journey and make the reader more involved to the story. Unfortunately Demon Slayer does not do any
                  of that particularly well and the consequences show. Everything our characters do comes out like an unearned heist sequence without any impact to the story at all. The only thing that seemingly matters is who dies but I did not feel involved with any of the characters at all.
I really did not care whether any of the characters will live or not. Sure most are cool, however, they are also static to a fault. The badass design and tragic backstory are certainly there but where are the aspirations, the character, the drama? I feel like the hashiras are just some npcs with programmed responses, present only for Tanjiro (the boringest default soy boy character ever) to interact with. Admittedly, Zenitsu and Inosuke have some non-completely forced drama, but it was too weakly resolved to count. Good characters certainly don't lack style, but they do lack substance.
The writing of the villains, however, sucks pee pee. They are stuck in this limbo zone of inconsistency between a tragic backstory, goodness at heart, and the fact that they have eaten half of the population of Japan. While we, readers are meant to empathise, the villains are subjected to the stupidest most awkward character development template: 
   > I am not bad at all, but I live in a society
   > have to protect someone excuse
   > *dies *gets vampirized 
   > ok, now I am over-the top evil. I want power and revenge 
   > *gets fucking decapitated
   > Tanjiro holds hand and reads last will, feels bad man
   > omg, I made a mistake, I am good actually
   > Tanjiro, thanks for teaching me this cheap-ass brain-dead moral lesson
   > proceeds to suck Tanjiro off and dies for real
Demon Slayer has no sense of drama and everything it does is cut short. No character has any genuine development and resolution. Boring, meaningless fights are stretched far too long, while in-between moments (with training and character development) are either basic-Tanjiro-level-cringe-worthy or unexplored at all. I really hate to have to do this, but I think Kimetsu no Yaiba lacks fillers and thus shounen substance. Nevertheless, the form is unparalleled - the style of Meiji (or smt) Japan, interesting magic system, creative fight visuals, cool backstories and character design. 5/10",5,kapu02

                This show is, it's special, yet so generic. First of all the Saaaaaaakuga, is absolutely stunning. It's certainly the biggest draw of this anime, but not the only one by a long shot. The story is certainly the weakest element along with some of the writing. That is not to say those elements are weak, because they are far from it, it's just to say, they're generally generic... The story is dark, but slightly campy. The characters are fun, but play on their stereotypes a bit too heavily at times. Finally the writing can be the weakest point , but does have highlights. The characters
                  are some of my favorite parts, including the ""Villains"", yes they can be overplayed at times, but they are mostly enjoyable, well designed, and cute. Nezuko is the best girl! Finally one of my favorite parts of the show... the villains, without saying too much, the villains are 3 dimensional, it may be just a monster of the week show, but it truly has more heart than that. I don't want to say more to avoid spoilers, but I highly recommend this title, at worst you'll see it as a generic monster of the week anime. At best, you'll see it as a well crafted, piece of art, with generic story boarding.",9,ExtremelyToxic

Story:
                  7,5/10 i guess?
Tells about a young man named Kamado Tanjirou, a charcoal seller who goes around the whole village, because Tanjirou's father has died, he is the one who replaces his father's job to earn money.
The Kamado family is a happy family on the edge of the village mountains, but, after returning to work selling charcoal, a bad thing happened, the whole family was killed by the leader of the devil named Kibutsuji Muzan.
However, one of his family members, his younger sister, Kamado Nezuko, is still alive, but he has been turned into a Devil. When Tanjirou lifted him away and sought help through the cold mountains, at that moment, he was attacked by her own younger sister, Nezuko who had turned into a Demon.
While getting attack by Nezuko, he was assisted by one of the member of Demon Killing corps known as Tomioka Giyuu, even so, he continued to argue that he would make Nezuko return to being Human again and Nezuko would not be killed. When he fought Tomioka Giyuu using stones and axe, he fell while fighting him, but the axe he threw up almost hit Giyuu. When Tanjirou was getting knocked, Nezuko ran towards Tanjirou not to devour him, except, she protected him.
At that time, Giyuu also believed in Tanjirou that he could restore his younger sister, Nezuko, to become a human again, he also invited him to practice being a Demon Slayer and seek information about things that could make Nezuko back into a human.
The story has a nice pacing, character development, the writing of the story isn't so mediocre, i guess?

Somehow, Japan is like this ""OMG! a cute younger sister, i can't believe i fell in love with my own younger sister, t-this is unbelievable"" BS.

                I'm going to projectile vomit my distaste for the insufferable comedy this show has. If comedy is not part of your show and serves no to *effectively* lighten the mood rather than make it insufferable, best not to add it in. This show is already has subpar writing, however its saviour is the lore and its themes of dark, gore, main character with a mission etc. It is also really interesting to see a heroine that is not only intelligent and able, but also sympathetic. I don't think tanjiro ever failed to make me smile. Sadly I cannot forgive poor attempts at comedy, especially in
                  the form of the zenitsu dude. (really annoying and embarrassing) (Pig character isn't better off either.)
If you find yourself able to withstand the incessant cringing you may get from watching this show, there are very touching parts that still makes it nice to watch. However it's all up to taste and demon slayer is slightly boring imo, especially with its writing. The characters also don't get much character depth and our MC Tanjiro doesn't have anything special about him other than the typical cookie cutter heroine. Despite all this the show does give off a sense of warmth and it is quite nice to see our mc show sympathy to the 'enemies', while still being firm with what's right and wrong.",5,wonderlandblvrd

Your typical shounen done perfectly with one of the best characters designs I ever seen.
An anime about killing zombie demons how shounen is that.
This anime takes what other shounen shows have done for the genre and makes a perfect story with it. It is nothing experimental or complicated going on is just a very good action anime.
I loved the characters in this anime they are excellently drawn and well written.
This anime is not a drag to watch it can be very wholesome and creepy at the same time; with this contrast of ideas you might think the
                  story is not taken that seriously, but the tension and stress in some scenes just work so well.

'Kimetsu no Yaiba' translates to demon slayer. It's about slaying demons that's all you need to know for now. It's better if you watch this show and let the story unfold on it's own rather than have to read a synopsis. I just jumped into this anime and the experience was better for me that way.
Art:
The action scenes were amazing! Some scenes switch to the first person perspective (zooming camera) making it feel as if you were part of the action.
Sound:
Awesome soundtracks that will go into the anime playlist. LiSA does not disappoint.
The voice acting was good.Character:
There's quite a diverse cast of characters with unique personalities. Michael Jackson is also the main villain/Final Boss. (or is he?)

                Kimetsu no Yaiba (2019)
Story 
Demon Slayer really does have a great premise for the story. It is really involved and developed which leads to excitement. Even when it winds down away from crazy combat it still feels amazing to watch. Emotions are shown so bare. 
Art
The art used is just a superb format and is perfect for the series. If it was CGI or any more detailed it would feel a bit less. Graphics during a fight sequence adding what cannot be seen is just perfect. Sound
The OST for the series is again amazing. They fit all the scenes really well and give you a good idea of what is going on. You also get a really good feel for the situations unfolding with the music. 
Character
Characters are really well done. Such a variety of them as well is just awesome. Seeing the Slayers from different backgrounds with different attitudes towards everything is well developed. Being able to talk to each other like humans and change minds is really well done also. 
The best of character though is the demons. To see their more human sides realising they mostly have something that made them vulnerable to willingly become a demon is great. It makes you wonder about Nezuko was she more willing or was she forced. 
Enjoyment
It is to the point I could easily and I am tempted to rewatch it all again because it was such a powerful season.

Absolutely, I would recommend this because it is a great show. It sets the bar really high and hopefully, the movie and other potential releases keep up with that standard.",10,robert788

                This is a somewhat generic Shōnen with everything going for it. You can tell that so much effort was poured into this show, it's a gem despite following the same path as the other popular shows of the genre.
The story and character is okay, but it's the animation that really pulls this through. The art is absolutely gorgeous, and the soundtrack reaches a crescendo that gives epic scenes so much oomph that you don't even want to blink.

                The eyes in this show are SOOOOOO creepy. At first I couldn't even watch 30 seconds of this show without gagging. But after hearing everyone rave about it I bit down on a piece of bamboo and gave it a try.
This is the worst anime I have ever watched. After 11 episodes, I just can't take any more. This is not an anime; it is a series of nice pictures to accompany a book. The show is 50% internal monologuing, 20% repeating something someone just said, 20% people being a***oles to the main protagonist for no reason, and 10% the main protagonist shouting the name
                  of his sister repeatedly. It seems like maybe Ufotable mistook the manga for a series of storyboards and put that directly on the screen, albeit with exceptional art. That is not how you make an anime. Anime and manga are two different mediums; they tell stories differently. When I said above that this was the worst anime, more specifically this is terrible direction combined with fantastic scene design. Every frame is a work of art, but when those frames move it becomes extraordinary painful to watch.
For a while I was watching with the promise that I could make fun of how stupid it was. That was entertaining. But in episode 11 we meet this guy in yellow who screams and cries non-stop and that was the breaking point for me. It's like someone said, ""Hey, we've done a great job being boring and stupid up till now, but how about we take it up a notch and be super annoying as well?"" Or maybe there's a bet going on at Ufotable to see how bad they can make this show and have people still rave about it.
My favorite scene was when the protagonist got hit in the head with a huge log swinging from a rope. Remember that scene in Return of the Jedi when the ewoks destroyed an ATST with two logs swinging from ropes? It was like that. In my mind, I like to think the protagonist of Demon Slayer died right then and the show ended there.
As first I was bothered by the gagging of the female protagonist. You don't get more misogynistic than that, right? But by the end she was my favorite character precisely because she didn't talk since the words out of everyone else's mouths were just so dumb.
So here's the thing: there are many aspects to a show and everyone is gonna have their own idea of what's important. For me, that's good acting, a well thought out story, and likeable characters. This show fails on all counts, which is why I say it's the worst thing I've watched. But I understand for other people they might find the visual design the most important thing, or the fight choreography, or the concepts, or some other aspect. That's cool. That's why I can end up disliking some super popular stuff, and why there are some shows I love that I nevertheless wouldn't recommend. We come to shows looking for different things. This show does not have the things I'm looking for.",3,kc2dpt

                All in all, this was a decent anime, with potential leading into future seasons, however, this season by itself was quite lacking. I went in with quite high hopes given the incredibly strong rating at this time, yet was very underwhelmed. It has your run of the mill premise of a character undergoing training to get strong so that he can slay demons to achieve his goal of saving his sister. It has gorgeous animation with a unique style, a decent soundtrack/score, and has a rather interesting world with all of the color and hints they throw in throughout the season, however there is very
                  little resolution and answers provided to certain key plot-driving questions over the course of the 26 episodes. What is the significance of Tanjiro's family history? How was Tanjirou able to see the children during his training? How is Nezuko different than all other demons? Why is she solely able to restrain herself from eating humans? The list goes on. We're introduced to a number of key characters that are hinted to have rich backgrounds and history, yet little to nothing is revealed about them (looking at you - Tomioka, Urokodaki, Tanjiro's family, ""Master"", Hashiras, etc.), the demons, nor the main villain and their respective motivations that drive each character. In my opinion, the anime struggles in a few areas in particular:
Pacing - The pacing of this show is all over the place. It jumps right in providing the context for the story pretty quickly and early on, but the main character pretty quickly goes from ""zero to hero"" over the course of just 1-2 episodes, with a few years flying by, without really diving into specifics of his training, which I would personally find more satisfying and believe would enrich his character with more depth and dimension in a way that brings the audience closer to him. Further, the story jumps around from mission to mission, with little resolution around the side stories and villains that we're introduced to - they're just kind of swept under the rug in favor of moving onto the next mission. Finally the season ends on a bit of a weird note. The season's (underwhelming) climax resolves a few episodes before the end of the season so the last few episodes felt oddly underwhelming and out of place, as if they weren't really needed. And some characters who were introduced in the first few episodes don't even get reintroduced until these last few episodes, which felt quite anti-climactic.
Character development - The main character and his sister don't grow emotionally almost at all throughout the series. Tanjirou stays his same determined self while Nezuko barely does or says anything, both of which leave much to be desired. The comic relief characters Inosuke and Zenitsu don't exhibit any depth or growth, beyond the superficial, obnoxious, cacophonous, cantankerous behavior you see from the get go. The demons faced throughout the show have pretty generic characters, with minimal depth, outside of Rui who got a bit of a backstory towards the end of the season, despite how rather uninspiring it was. I have to hope the character development of the main cast gets better fleshed out in future seasons/movies.
Tone - This show would be much better as a serious dark fantasy. To reiterate from above, the comic relief is quite forced. Inosuke and Zenitsu are incredibly irritating from the moment they're introduced up until the very end. They have a tendency of ruining the otherwise serious mood with unnecessary shouting which I mostly fast forwarded through. Some battles were even ruined by comic relief from the demons, who would sometimes interject with immature banter - such as the first demon encounter at the temple and the first mission demon. With ""comedy"" not being in this show's lineup of genres, it should really stick with where it's forte lies - in the dark fascinating world that's been created and the dark atmosphere that naturally results from it.
All in all, worth a watch with decent potential for future seasons, but on its own, this season is lacking and definitely does not live up to the hype that the (currently) high rating would otherwise suggest.",6,loonytoongonemad

                I've watched through the end of Entertainment District, so this review will be colored by the quality of both seasons. The criticisms apply to everything as a whole.
The short is: great animation, terrible writing. Meh music and meh acting.
The anime uses a combination of 3D and 2D animation and does a decent job of blending them (though it gets kind of jarring on Mugen Train). During fight scenes, which are everything in this anime, there is some beautiful sakuga. The water and fire moves are drawn with brilliant high contrast visuals which look like moving stained glass, similar in style to Wu Shan Wu Xing.
                  There is a lot of battle damage to the environment and characters which helps to keep things exciting. Battles are long and drawn out, with a lot of action. Both the backgrounds and the characters look good.
The writing is mostly a vehicle to deliver the fight scenes to you, but there are also some training scenes and also flashbacks for various demons to try to make you feel sorry for them as they are defeated, for some reason. As far as the objective of turning Nezuko back to a human, there is no progression on that front. And as for the objective of the enemy, well, we aren't really given one and for all I know, there isn't one and they exist only to have something to fight.
The fights are filled with inexplicable power-ups on both sides. One side will overpower the other, until the other side pulls something from their ass, and it goes back and forth. The characters become as powerful as the plot requires them to be. Dragon Ball Z does a better job of power growth, and that's an insult. Also, often the demons will score a decisive blow on the heroes, and then just lollygag while giving the helpless heroes time to stand up and recover, or for someone else to show up. Everybody is just so stupid in battle. Heroes will receive wounds, only to shrug them off a moment later. At least there is a weak explanation for Tanjirou's power-ups. Nezuko's power-ups have no explanation at all.
About 70% of the characters are annoying. The acting is totally over the top, all of the time. Most of the dialog consists of yelling, and nobody is capable of holding a normal conversation. Maybe the shonen audience will think this is funny, but it just rots my seinen brain. On the other hand, Nezuko doesn't talk at all. So we get basically no character development from her.
Given the choice between what is cool and what is logical, the author will choose the rule of cool. So as long as you don't try to think too hard about it, you will see some cool stuff happening. Having a secret society Demon Slayer Corps that normal people don't know about sounds pretty cool, but there's no way they could actually function this way. Like, how do they get funded?",5,Khashishi

                Hi dear reader, It has been some time since I did one of my reviews, where I try to keep out as many spoilers as possible and at the same time try to give you some idea of what you're about to watch and if it's worth your time. And without further ado, LET'S BEGIN.
So, I was very, VERY sceptical, when I started watching this particular anime. The reason was simple, it was overhyped by everyone. And when people are overhyping something, I just cannot go casually on this, I will put my guard on and start to step slowly, little by little into the
                  flames of hype. There are only two ways Hype can end, that is good or bad. But don't worry, this time it is good, but it might not be as good as the hype fans think it is.
Here's a reason why. Small flaws. Some may say that it is nothing, but for something that is highly praised by fans, it cannot be overlooked. Also sometimes, if there is a specific type of story telling, these small flaws can disrupt the story.
We are dealing with a very talented Studio and I bet a lot of fans don't even know themselves who they even are. The studio Ufotable are the creators of the Fate/ anime series, Tales of Zesteria X and of course GodEater. These titles alone are worth while talking about, but now is not the time for it, it was just to notify those who thought that it is a small studio's first work, cause it's not. And because of this, it also gave me another reason to look at it properly.
Now, let's look into the anime deeper, to see what are these flaws and what to more or less expect.
I don't think I need to tell the description of it, you can read it yourself on MAL if you want, but you don't need to read it to understand what I will say. So first flaw (atleast I call a flaw) is the timeskip at the very beginning (Training). Here's why I call it a flaw, if you put a timeskip already at the start, the flow of time within the story get's shifted (time sometimes goes really fast (even too fast even for an anime) and then suddenly goes slowly) and it is hard to even out, they got it done by the end of the season, but it would've been a lot better and easier to put it just a little bit later, then it would've been more even and unnoticable.
Second flaw, artstyle. Don't jump on me yet, just because I mentioned it, doesn't mean it's bad, on the contrary it's really good. The problem, that I'm having is the uneven style for fighting effects, more specifically main character. It seems that the MC effects have been ""watered down"" (That's a pun, you'll understand if you've watched the anime) making the MC fighting effects seem to look lower quality compared to the other character's effects. Don't get me wrong they still look good on the MC, but to me it seems that the effect is missing something and it doesn't have that power, that ""Umpf"" that it needs. For it is the MC afterall. (P.s. I'm not taking in the characters secondary abilities that he gains with the progression of the story, It is only about the main abilties he uses.) That's all I got for flaws.
Overall I did enjoy Kimetsu no Yaiba a lot. It is very well written and designed, the characters feel original and are pleasing to the eye. There are a lot of good Voice Actors chosen for this anime and you can see that they are really striving towards perfection. It's also one of the first times that I don't mention anything about character design. Why? Because they're perfect. The story with the characters flow really well. I would give this anime a rating 9.5, if not for those two small flaws I would've given it a max rating.
I hope that this gave you some understanding about it. And if you decide to watch it, you will see something unique, that you haven't seen anywhere else.
I hope you enjoy it, PEACE!   
P.S. There will be more Reviews comin in the future, so keep an eye out for those. ;)",9,I-Arcius-I

                Look I'll be honest. I'm not particularly big on art style and direction. I'm usually more impressed by strong writing, character development and overall themes.
But my word if this isnt the most beautifully animated series I've seen. And I'm not simply talking about the eye-gasmic fight scenes which stands up to anything we've seen but even normal shots of every episode. Sometimes the dialogue takes a step back so we can fully appreciate the spectacle. 
In terms of the story, its nothing truly original, deep or revolutionary. (You're too busy being wowed by the animation!) Like people often say, its taking shounen tropes and refining
                  it to the fullest. Characters haven't received a whole lot of development to be honest but most of them atleast hint at having interesting backstories. Tanjiro might not be incredibly complex but he's immediately established very likeable, caring for Nezuko and kind-hearted. 
Some use this as a slight against him. I disagree. Not every protagonist needs to be ""transformed"" especially not within 1 season. Neither do they have to start off as a snivelling coward who ""grows over time into a hero"" . He rarely gets on ones nerves for the sake of some cheap fanservice or comedic relief. Immediately plus for me. Also its clearly demonstrated that he's not OP (as of yet anyway) so the viewer remains vested in following his growth. Not to mention his standout trait of empathy for humans and demons alike - yet doesnt fall prey to the idealistic rules of not killing. He does what needs to be done.
Nezuko is adorable and I love her dynamic with Tanjiro. Inosuke starts off a bit over the top but actually gradually becomes endearing. Zenitsu is the crybaby coward who doesnt even realise his own strength so he gets a bit tiresome after a while but I suppose the comic relief element might be for the younger viewers. 
Overall, I felt that it started off well if not spectacular,  but steadily built up a head of steam as the world building and introduction of more characters picked up...it ended off with great expectations for future adaptations. Can't wait for more!",9,TanjiroTheGoat

                I made a review on this a couple months ago. I realized how garbage it was and decided to make a new review. I've actually watched 16/26 eps, ignore what mal says.
Let's start with the story. It's a typical shounen story. Tanjiro's family dies [which I coudn't care less because they were on screen for like 2 minutes], his surviving sister becomes a demon. Now Tanjiro must find a way to cure his sister. Okay not bad, there's a lot you can do with this. Tanjiro decides to become demon slayer, basically the reskinned Ninja, Hero, Hunter, mage, etc. Alright, getting a little cliche but
                  not bad. 
The world building is a bit iffy, how does Tanjiro no believe a demons. There's an entire police force dedicated to fighting them. People get killed by demon all the time. TANJIRO MEETS A DEMON SLAYER. But he still doesn't believe in demons, aight. 
Tanjiro starts to train but it holds 0 emotional weight because they speed through it. Some might say, oh but it's different then most shounen training arcs because it didn't take a 1000 eps. Just because something's different doesn't make it good. We don't see any of the techniques tanjiro learns so the first time we're in a fight, it's not grounded. Tanjiro could pull anything out of his as$ and win to fight because we don't know any of the techniques he's learned. Oh an tanjiro can talk to these 2 specific ghost for some reason. 
We then learn Nezuko was sleeping the entire time Tanjiro was training which again, leaves no emotional weight since we only found out  after Tanjiro finished training. We find out Nezuko was hypnotized to think humans good, demons bad...okay???? how does that work, how did the old man hypnotize her. Why couldn't it just be the love for her family keeping her from harming humans. If she was un-hypnotized she'd kill humans right? So her entire relationship between her and other humans feels fake. It would be better suited with the themes of family if it was her own restraint on herself for the sake of her brother. 
Anyways Tanjiro kills some demon blah blah blah, don't care. Tanjiro takes a Demon Slayer test that wasn't very creatively designed. It's just ""fight demon, who survive get license"". Tanjiro later meets a nurse demon chick who says she can cure her sister using the 12 demon moons blood I believe (correct me If I'm wrong). Alright, we set up a structure, kill all the demon moons, collect their blood, cure sister. Okay now the story's grounded now we can- just kidding, later in the story Muzan kills almost all the 12 demon moons. What was the point of setting that up. To subvert expectations? Again, different doesn't mean good. Tanjiro fights fake demon moon and later goes into this town and finds muzan AND TOUCHES HIM. WHAT?! He touches the big final boss and were not even half way into the first season. Now the villain just feels anti-climatic due to the writer allowing Tanjiro to get so close to him so quickly. Then the villain just turns some random guy into a demon right in public in front of Tanjiro with no care in the world. WHY would he do that? He's risking his human persona, he has a whole family! [also are we not going to address the fact Muzan's daughter is half demon and half human?] This just feels like the writer needed a way for Tanjiro to confirm Muzan is the guy he's after so she just writes in Muzan making a dumb decision. 
A little while later, Tanjiro befriends Inosuke and Zenitsu. I'm going to take this time to talk about the characters. Jesus christ I hate Zenitsu. All Zenitsu does is cry, scream, sexually harass women and suddenly become an amazing fighter when the plot needs him too. Inosuke is fun but there nothing much to his character except for the gag of him being pretty boy and head butting everything. Nezuko is a severely underused and an underdeveloped character. She's like a pretty decoration whilst being extremely essential. The writer never fleshed out her relationship with her brother, and she's constantly subjected to the box. She's just cute anime girl, cinnamon roll, smol bean bait. 
Neuzko is extremely important to the plot, everything relies on her. This causes Nezuko to never have any real stakes because if she were to die, everything falls apart. If she were in a fight, nothing matters because you'll know she'll turn out fine. If she gets hurt, she'll just sleep it off. The viewer never haves to worry about her. Tanjiro's boring af. He's nice. That's it, he's nice and kind and likes his sister. 
Now moving on, Tanjiro goes into this haunted house, I actually really enjoyed this mini arc. The villain was cool, the house was cool. The only thing I didn't enjoy was Zenitsu's unfunny antics. After that Tanjiro and co. goes off the fight spider family. This is the part where I dropped the show because I literally couldn't take Zenitsu anymore and I didn't feel the story was good enough to balance my hatred for crying yellow man. 
I have no intention of continuing the anime, I don't care about hyped up episode 19, fights don't do it for me anyways. All this show is beauty with no substance. I can guarantee if the animation wasn't so stellar, this show wouldn't be where it is now. It's a medicore story. The manga's score use to be rated a 7.46, this just goes to show nothing about the story was worth over an 8.0, the animation carried the entire thing. Did the hype ruin it for me? Maybe, I never really had my expectations high for shounen battle anime because usually the only reason it's hyped is because of its fights. 
If you believe I only dislike the show because it's popular please go cry about it. You can't excuse criticism for show with ""oh you just hate it because it's popular"". My favorite shows are literally Death Note, Cowboy Bebop and Hunter x Hunter, I'm not some hipster. I have no reason to hate on Mainstream. Anyways, here are my scores:

                Mature themes and heavy violence contrasted with an unpalatable mixture of immature humor and lifeless looking characters.
Demon Slayer features a Mary Sue protagonist named Tanjiro Kamado, who will stop at nothing to cry at the realization that he is not #1 at everything in the world. Along his way, he will show mercy to everyone, be polite to everyone, and teach those who are mean to others a lesson or two in being a better person. He is the literal definition of a Mary Sue. His only 'fault' is not being absolutely perfect. 
The start of his journey happens when his entire family is murdered
                  by a demon, and his sister, Nezuko Kamado, is transformed into a demon, because the plot demands it. Luckily for us, the plot also demands that Nezuko retains her exact same appearance after being transformed into a demon, and she does not take on any of the freakish transformations that every other demon in the series has been shown to take upon transformation. Luckily for us, the plot ALSO demands that she somehow still has strength that can surpass those of extremely powerful demons. [It's harder to sell Nezuko figures if she isn't cute].
The show handles a couple of things extremely well. While I criticize Tanjiro for being a Mary Sue, credit should be given to the fact that he is merciless when the situation calls for such action. Unfortunately, everything in the show is over-explained to the point where it becomes insulting to the viewer.
The lack of subtlety makes this exhausting to watch. Some of the episodes make me feel like the show is written for children, but then it's contrasted with moments where it tries to take itself way too seriously. There is also heavy violence.
If you're part of their ""Target Audience,"" you will probably enjoy this show, but the way it's written completely alienates anyone outside of that. Until I read the manga, I cannot accurately determine if this is a result of bad productions decisions, or if the source material was written this way as well. [Manga is usually better, always].",2,Poisenbery

                Preliminary review after drop on ep 10/26:
The dialogue and story were the weakest part followed by the music. Pacing and humor was odd, transitions were jarring, flashbacks were mishandled and it doesn't know how to handle multiple characters during a fight scene. World building was weak, there wasn't any explanation made for the skills and reasoning for why things happen as they do. It sometimes rushes to catch up explaining why some things occur and feels poorly conceptualized. The demons in the story could've been effectively menacing if only they used more mystery and gore. I couldn't empathize or care for the characters enough to
                  be affected by each and everyone of them even with the back stories portrayed. 
On the other hand, animation was really good especially in shots where a character was moving smoothly down a mountain path, depiction of flame under a pot, rapidly slicing through multiple objects, water flowing from the blade or when the screen quickly moves through alleyways and in the small elements here and there but sometimes it feels overused. There are old anime out there with not enough of a budget in animation as this but is able to deliver a dose so potent it manages to be mind-blowingly good. 
This anime missed its mark and manages to be bland amidst the good animation. 
Final review after continuing and reaching ep 26/26:
I admit I was swayed by some of the reviews but because the animation was quite good I just had to go back and see for myself. 
The animation gets even better: the scene where a kagura dance is performed, a tree falling on the river followed by water getting displaced, looking at leaves on the trees from the forest floor in the evening, transitions in a world of relativity, fight scenes, and a moving train were particularly outstanding. 
The music, transitions and flashbacks have improved too especially when they reach Mount Natagumo at episode 15. Humor is still odd but thankfully tolerable at times. The pacing has gotten decent although scenes in the final episodes have been extended. The dialogue has improved slightly but I find myself fast forwarding as some scenes were bland or repetitive. World building and story telling had so many missed opportunities in turning Kimetsu no Yaiba one of the best anime's this year. 
I still couldn't care enough for the characters; the only part where this anime almost had depth was when Tanjiro would empathize with the demons he's slayed or fought. This story had so much potential and was almost lukewarm and forgettable until the splendid animation by ufotable dragged it by its neck towards being watchable.",6,Wawito
38000,"
                I started watching it because of the episode 19 hype. And yeah, episode 19 does live up to the hype, one of the best fights I've ever seen in my life. The rest of the anime is basically alright. Spoilers follow.
The plot is incredibly standard. You've got your teen shonen protagonist who's hardworking and indicates how hardworking he is by yelling a lot. (The vast majority of the show's comedy involves yelling of some sort by the main trio.) He's a kind and sweet kid, and the nice thing is that this really does come off as genuine in the show. He's a good boy.
                  He's also strongly moral and gets righteously pissed off at various evils. He's got an imouto to protect and has some lofty goals, his family got killed by demons, he's got a hardass sensei who's full of tough love and fatherly affection, etc. etc. Basically, there's nothing new here. As for the actual plot, he mostly goes on monster-of-the-week adventures with his buddies with a halfhearted overarching quest of maybe eventually running into some special demons and collecting blood from them to find a cure for Nezuko. It doesn't have a strong direction other than completing a series of quests that other demonslayers give to him. It's honestly not super clear why he wants to un-demon Nezuko so badly because she seems to be doing fine, to be honest.
The characters are ok, usually pretty standard but most of them are sweet decent people. The main character's little sister doesn't speak and barely does anything other than be cute or be useful or be a victim for the main character to save which... I guess works fine. It's not like imouto characters in other shows really need to talk either since they're not really human beings or characters, just props and useful tools to support the story. It does make the claims of a 2-way mutual sibling bond between them a little weird but after episode 19 it looks like Nezuko might actually be allowed talk and gain a personality, so I'm optimistic. The lightning guy has a really annoying personality where he basically screams constantly and has this over-the-top coward act. You can have a cowardly character without having him shout about his cowardice 24/7. I like the boar masked guy. The demons usually have a sad past which isn't anything groundbreaking, but it's nice to see them have their moments of forgiveness and absolution right before they die.
The art and animation are the real winners here. The whole show is strongly influenced by traditional Japanese mythology, symbolism, etc. which is really lovely. Character designs are beautiful and the kimonos look very nice. The sword water effects in particular are just gorgeous. Fight scenes are straight up beautifully done, with great camera movement, and they look both dynamic and flow well. They almost always have one frame in the sequence that has breathtaking fine-art level composition (zenitsu and the moon, blessed rain after the drought, episode 19). Actual fight choreography is great too (hand to hand fight between inosuke and tanjiro). Episode 19's conclusion is absolutely perfect and honestly, I felt like I was having a religious experience watching the conclusion of that fight sequence. Wow. The entire spiders arc was shockingly good, and I was unprepared for it going in because I figured it was just going to be another monster of the week extermination job. On top of stunning animation most of the main cast's development/fleshing out happened during this arc which helped make the payoff even more satisfying.
I kind of wish I'd stopped at 19 though because the next episode immediately started off with a ""oops none of that meant anything, the spider boy actually beheaded himself with his own string riiight before tanjiro slashed him!"" despite it being stated earlier that spider boy's neck was stronger than his threads... I felt cheated by that. I think the issue is that the author didn't want it to be that easy to kill one of the 12 kizuki, who are supposed to be the series's end bosses, but she could have accomplished that by just not making the spider boy one of the 12... at least we got the consolation prize of getting to see the water breathing 11th form, which was beautiful.",6,cfeather

                Demon Slayer is one of those adaptations that not only meet the source material's expectations, but does it in a way that creates one of the most compelling shows of its season, let alone the decade. Where certain anime on the top anime list excel in multiple aspects of a show, such as Steins;Gate with its psychological build-up combined with a rich and deep story, Demon Slayer also excels in this same regard. 
Story: Demon Slayer's story seems to me to be strong, but not as strong as certain other action shows that have scored highly. The story is what accompanies the action in this
                  show, which is why it works well, but when it comes to deep and rich plot details that twist into curves, Demon Slayer may not be the show that tries to incorporate that into its run. Instead, story elements are implemented within the action, which turns it into a unique experience where you not only see progression within a character, but you receive explanation as to what is going on and what the lore has to offer as it occurs. In terms of battle choreography and orchestration, Demon Slayer does this masterfully, and it shows in its fluidity of action. The battles are lengthy, but they serve as challenges that Tanjiro and company face in order to grow not just as a slayer, but also as characters. This may help the character aspect of the show much more than the story, but it can be seen that the story is being driven as well due to these action scenes. As they pan out, it is obvious that you are being fed information on lore, such as the examples of the 12 Kizuki and the various different styles of fighting that are taught to aspiring recruits. However, it can be seen that the story is not the main part of the show.
Art: Demon Slayer's art is amazing. The show already has smooth animation in times of peace and amazing animation throughout battles that is only accompanied by detailed visuals and various art styles with each addition of a new form from a new character. In battle, you can see the sheer scale of enemy attacks and the technicality used in slayer attacks. The art style changes are nice additions that accompany the visuals really well in combat. However, the main focus of the show is not just on the details of the fights, but also how they appear as a whole. ufotable has already established themselves as one of if not the top animators for action shows, seen with their still impressive Fate/Zero. The battle scenes in Demon Slayer are just as vibrant but uniquely different from other works such as Fate, but all share the same idea that the battles are the main focus of the show. The art in these battles are what really shine, and the thing that sets Demon Slayer apart from other action shows is how well the battles flow throughout the entire episode. While if you compare the battle scenes from a much more recent but still really good example, such as the Fate/Grand Order -  Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia anime, Cloverworks has done a really good job in their show. However, the difference is that the fights in Demon Slayer encompass the entire episode, and sometimes even more. The fact is that the show has found the formula for creating an even and fluid battle design that doesn't get stale even after 20 minutes of pure action, while certain shows that still have great action can only manage a few minutes of action. On the other hand of art, the character designs are also what sets Demon Slayer apart from other action shows. While it is a given for the main cast to look unique and different from each other, the demons themselves are what really drives the show. The demon designs range from grotesque to humanoid to traditional yet extremely buff. These varying designs allow for all the battles to be memorable in their own way, even if the development of these demons may not be as memorable as their designs. This is where the show excels, and by a landslide.
Sound: The voice acting in Demon Slayer is spot on, especially with the emotions and the ""vibe"" of characters in many scenes. In particular, Zenitsu's performance is a huge star of the show in my opinion. While, yes, he is annoying and for the longest part of the show, a coward, his voice actor brings his fear and anguish straight into the spotlight without any moment that is underwhelming. While I may have thought that Tanjiro would have a slightly deeper voice than what he has in the show, the voice given to him matches his personality along with his positive outlook on people and demons. Music-wise, the opening theme opens up every episode with a build-up that gets you in the mood for action. 
Character: Although Demon Slayer is primarily action first when it comes to the focus of the show, I felt that character could have been expanded upon a bit more than it was in the 26 episodes of the first season. While Tanjiro enjoyed the bulk of character development as the main protagonist, other characters such as Inosuke got a slight bit of the cut as development was centered more around perfecting a flaw rather than changing as a person. Tanjiro's character development is in the experiences that he has throughout the show and how he is able to learn more and more about each individual demon - and the struggle that they face. This gives Tanjiro an edge on his character development as he shows a change of heart from the beginning of the show. In the beginning, Tanjiro mostly looked at demons aside from his sister as beings that were out to kill, rather than people whose lives had been tainted due to suffering. As battles are born and die, Tanjiro eventually learns to sympathize with the experiences that the demons he fights face, and that even though they are currently demons who have killed, that they were people who had personal experiences beforehand. This is in sharp contrast to the other main protagonists in his trio. Zenitsu and Inosuke work more on fixing their flaws, with Zenitsu trying to become braver and Inosuke learning more about culture and society. They don't really grow as people more than individuals, and their progress mostly only affects themselves. However, since character is not the main drive of the show, and there are many more arcs to be written, there is a chance that character development for these characters may be seen later. As a side note, it is also appealing to see that even side characters are given backstories and a small change throughout the times where they are seen in the show. This small detail is what compensates for the ""lack"" of development in the other main characters.
Enjoyment: I binged 10 episodes in a span of 4 hours back to back. I think that tells you enough.
Overall: There is no way that I wouldn't recommend Demon Slayer to anyone who is even slightly interested in it. It's a journey filled to the brim with action and appealing animation. If you're into action or adventure in the slightest, I would highly recommend Demon Slayer, especially as the movie is in the works.",9,Rabb2t

                Demon slayer or KnY, while boasting one of the most remarkable fight scenes/ Episodes EVER (Looking at you, EP19), have plenty of mediocrity to its name as well. Let us start with the story first. 
Story
————
I reckon everyone already knows what the premise of this show is, so i’ll not waste time on that. The problem i have with demon slayer’s episodic nature is that when an anime goes into an episodic route — meaning every episode/ a few episodes can stand alone as their own story, without ever having any impact to the REAL matter at hand — Catching Michael Jackson secretly moon walking,
                  is that it gets hard to be invested story-wise in those particular episodes. KnY’s way of compensating this is to insert meaningless ‘backstory’ to the villains of the show, in order to incite a sense of empathy/sympathy towards the demons, as well as to add more elements to the particular ‘mini arc’ story-wise. But in all seriously, who cares? How many of you seriously cared when the tsuzumi demon’s backstory was shown? Oh he was criticized for having no talent in writing, whoa i cant believe it. Or,  Rui’s reason for wanting a foster family — which wasted so much runtime in EP 20 that i’m starting to think it’s just their way of padding runtime. Throughout this anime, i find myself wanting to see more of the fights rather than caring about the story, which says a lot about an anime that has way more ‘slice of life’/ acting all silly kinda moments than serious moments — yeah i know, its a shonen.. though i’ll have to admit my favourite eps (not including ep 19) was the ep right after the fight with tsuzumi demon. The interaction between the 3 protagonist in the wisteria ‘inn’? Was comedy gold. Which ONCE AGAIN says a lot about an anime slaying demons.
SOUND/ MUSIC/ ART
————————-
Nothing to see here. Top tier. 
CHARACTERS (only going talk about the ‘problems’)
———————-
Ok this is a hard one. I’ve heard people dropping the show simply because they couldn’t stand zenitsu’s constant yapping. Well, to be honest, at first i wasn’t able to as well. But after Yellow Flash thunder claps that sick lickythung, i understand that’s the way KnY wants to portray him — characters that seem the least threatening end up becoming the most OP. So after that, i was fine with his yapping. He even ended up becoming one of my fave characters in the series. Wish we could’ve seen more of him fighting though...
Next up we have the villains! Nothing much to say actually; simply forgettable, their backstory didn’t add any depth to their characters. For me personally, they’re just fodders for Hekireki Issen and ‘buckets’. AND YES, THATS A BAD THING if you think nothing much = good
Lastly, the Hashiras... yes, all of them. They are supposed to be the pinnacle of the demon slayer corps, but why the hell are they so damn comical? They way the looked/ acted made it such that i wasn’t able to take them seriously. In the few episodes they were present in, i just didn’t care about them at all, which shouldn’t happen when introducing such focal characters. The anime’s portrayal of them simply leaves much more to be desired. For u manga weebs thinking, ‘oh this guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about. The hashiras are op/badass folks.’ Yes, i’ve read the manga.
All in all, KnY is alright, didnt feel it was anything special to me personally. I still enjoyed the ride though, and  I can really see why people find it a masterpiece. I may not find it special, but it doesn’t mean others don’t/ or it isn’t. I bet if i were to watch this anime a few years back when i was younger, currently 22, it might have been one of my favourite animes, who knows. Note to readers, i’m also a guy that finds ‘my hero academia’ and ‘one punch man’ mediocre. Maybe shonen just isn’t kinda my thing anymore, since i aint a shonen no more. But once again, have to reiterate, ep 19 is a masterpiece, and little cutie nezuko just  makes me wanna pinch her so bad.
P.S. Do comment/ dm me if you feel otherwise. Want to know how others feel about this anime, and i’m always up for a discussion/ debate among fellow anime watchers. No name calling though, lets all be friends.",6,Master_Zod

                I like this show, very much.
If you watch Kimetsu no Yaiba for the story, you're gonna be disappointed of it's lackluster story and just 'good' characters. I have to give them points for the MC tho, Tanjiro is one of the few Shounen MC that I like. He shows sympathy to your average Demon grunt that was thrown on him. Actually made me shed a few token tears here and there.
The animation, combined with the sound of the satisfying final cut and music is what made this show enjoyable to watch. Ufotable is unmatched at the blending of 3D and 2D and this Kimetsu no
                  Yaiba is proof of that.",8,Anime_fan_net

                It's easy to get carried away watching this show for the first time since normally, a casual viewer would watch this going into it without a dose of cynicism, but upon second viewing, my enjoyment for this show gradually declined.
[S] The whole premise of the show is really nothing special. Think of it as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood but turn up the drama all the way to 11. Yeah, they get into some philosophical themes such as what does it mean to be human, etc, but it's not as compelling and well thought out as Brotherhood. Watching this show a second time and revisiting all the
                  dramatic scenes really becomes annoying because I found it really manipulative. The way this show tries to pull at your heartstrings is really cheap (Like dude, we get it, your love for Nezuko and your family is unbeatable) I don't wanna hear that shit over and over again. Overall, I hate how this show uses drama as a crutch to make the characters seem more interesting.
[A] One of the many good things this show has going is the art/animation/stills. Ufotable once again, proved to everyone that they're the apex when it comes to animation studios. At this point, it's safe to say that they can do no wrong. Furthermore, the way each episode is directed is absolutely fantastic. There are so many scenes in each episode that are very picturesque. In addition, the use of CGI was tasteful and not distracting, the whole thing just blends in nicely.
[S] It's Yuki Kajira, what else is there to say?
[C] The characters are meh. After the 2nd viewing, all of them just became insufferable in my eyes. Most of them are very one-note, especially that little bitch who couldn't stop whining and screaming. All of the characters are incredibly tropey.
This is the type of anime that I recommend to somebody who just started getting into anime. The hype surrounding this anime made it seem like it's the greatest fucking thing ever (Trust me, it's not). This anime is heavily flawed, but people tend to overlook that fact because of the visuals and sound. If it really wasn't for those two things, this anime would've flopped hard.",5,Hesternal

                Preamble
As this review will be lost in the infinite sea of discussion about this show, especially in those who criticize it, don't expect to see anything new here. I'm sure my opinion is very basic and you've seen it before. I'm sure this will be somewhat provocative for some people, but I do hope that you actually read through what I have to say. I'm not trying to tear the show apart or anything like that and you're allowed to enjoy this show as much as you want to. With that said, I have a few things to say about this show that perhaps you've
                  seen or heard before and are quite critical of the show. In all honesty, I fail to comprehend why it has the level of love that is has and maybe I'll inadvertently answer that question for myself as I write this review. I hope you enjoy my perspective of this show and maybe gain some insight into why people may not like it or even hate it. Also, this review will be mostly just confined to season 1, and very little about the Mugen Train movie and I have not seen season 2 at all nor do I have any intention to so if anything I say is fixed in season 2, remember my experience of Demon Slayer is limited to season 1 and the mugen train movie. Also, there will be spoilers all throughout this review so if you haven't seen the show already somehow, just stick to the introduction and conclusion parts and don't read past those. Now onto the review!
Introduction
Demon slayer is a fine show with excellent animation and production quality which leads to great action as a result of the expertise from the staff at ufotable. It has a run by numbers story and extremely one-note characters which is mostly fine besides one which we'll get into later. I do not hate this show nor do I like it. It's ok. As for why I think it's just ok and not amazing as far as the majority of the anime community is concerned, let me tell you.
Story
As far as story goes, you can't get more by the numbers than this. Pure of heart protagonist goes on a journey fuelled by revenge and redemption as he wants to make the demons responsible for his family's murder pay in addition to wanting to redeem himself since he feels responsible for their deaths and guilty since he did not believe in demons and left his family's side when they would have needed him most. Tanjiro after experiencing this tragedy, being let go by one of the Hashira and being discovered by a guy in a strange mask, then follows him and undergoes rigorous training in order to become a Demon Slayer (roll credits). After going through this training of mostly just 2 episodes, he ventures off to some event where he can officially be recognised as a demon slayer alongside other potential candidates. Here, Tanjiro has to defeat a powerful demon for someone his level which he does and the others who made it out alive also get rewarded for surviving the trial. My memory of what happens after this point is a bit blurry so forgive me if I get any details wrong, but I at least remember the main things that happen. After the trial, Tanjiro becomes a demon slayer and is sent on his 1st assignment by a weird talking crow where he's sent to a village where 3 demons are terrorizing the citizens and stealing and killing the young women there specifically for a reason I don't remember. He defeats them with his water breathing techniques and swordsmanship and all is well. After this, Tanjiro tries to relax in a town where he meets Kibutsuji and confronts him, seeing he has a life among humans with a wife and child and Kibutsuji turns a guy into a demon so that would occupy Tanjiro's attention and he could just leave. In this confrontation, we meet lady demon and assistant guy demon (can't be bothered to look up their names, I have forgotten them and don't think I ever remembered them even while watching the show tbh). The lady's blood art magic causes a flowery fragrance that masks her presence or smt like that so she could distract the public and deal with the demon. Here he learns that Demons can coexist with people and that demons can learn to overcome their urges as shown by these demons he meets who also say that maybe they can turn Nezuko into a human again if he gets blood from the 12 moon demons, the most powerful demons that exist. 2 fairly powerful demons show up that fuck Tanjiro up for the most part until he, with the help of Nezuko and the 2 demons he met manages to best them. If my memory serves me right, those 2 demons were not part of the 12 at all, showing just how powerful the 12 must be if he could barely survive those 2 demons. After healing up, he's sent on his 2nd assignment where we meet Zenitsu before reaching the demon and after Tanjiro defeats the demon, we're introduced to Inosuke. They all rest up at some spa thing and are sent on the 3rd and final assignment we see in the 1st season, that being the ""family"" of spider demons. In this, we learn Nezuko has blood art magic, Tanjiro has some sort of fire technique that's more powerful than the water techniques he's been using, his fire is some sort of fire hashira, we get some backstory for Zenitsu and after defeating the forest of demons, the Hashira take Tanjiro and Nezuko. We meet all the hashira and Nezuko and Tanjiro get tested as the Hashira need proof that Nezuko is chill and not like the other demons and Tanjiro has to advocate for Nezuko. He succeeds and we move on where Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke rest up and also undergo more advanced training. Once they're done their they embark on the mugen train with the flame hashira where they would battle the most powerful of the lower 6 moons of the 12 demon moons who makes them go into their dreams until Tanjiro finds a way to snap out of it, they all break out the dream eventually, face the demon, defeat it and then another of the 12 moons shows up and kills the flame hashira. Well, after recapping the story, it really is nothing much and is fairly average, not bad or anything but serviceable. The story is definitely not a selling point of this show.
Gaps in the Story
Now time to talk about everything in this story that doesn't line up or doesn't make sense. Nezuko has very thick plot armour as she has magically overcome the impulses of being a demon and manages to have her own agency without it being informed by Kibutsuji's influence or command. She also doesn't have a need to consume flesh and satisfies herself with sleeping and none of this is ever explained nor is there any sort of logic within the world of the show where this would make any sense so it's just lazy and contrived writing so that the show could move forward. She also has an extremely powerful blood art that she uses in the fight against the spider demon which she just knows how to use all of a sudden but at least I can give the show an excuse on that and say it was just her demon instinct as that power is innate to her so I guess she could just pick and choose which demon instincts to have or use with no rhyme or reason. Even if I wouldn't be satisfied with the explanation they would've given alternatively, at least there would be an explanation and I wouldn't care as much about this point. How on Earth did Tanjiro not believe that demons existed at first? We know that the organization of demon slayers is fairly well known and the public call upon them to deal with demons. Even if no demon activity had taken place where Tanjiro lives up to the point of his family dying, there was still that guy near where Tanjiro lived warning him about demons and it's implied that it's routine for Tanjiro to leave to get wood and stuff and where he went this time is a usual place he goes to. I'm sure people would've talked about demons before and there must be cases that he's aware of where demons committed atrocities, not to mention the demon slayer organization which is called upon by the public to deal with demons. It makes no sense that Tanjiro wouldn't believe that demons exist and that they are a threat to his livelihood. When training, we hardly see how anything Tanjiro does correlates to his ability to slay demons. We know of the water breathing techniques but haven't really seen them be put into practice and we barely even see the techniques in the 1st place so we just see Tanjiro do stuff later on with water breathing techniques we've never seen and just have to assume that he's using them well and him using them is impressive instead of seeing the hard work he went through to learn them and see how the different techniques should be used based on circumstance and whatnot leaving every use of it subsequently to be unsatisfying and random because it feels like the writers are pulling this shit out of their ass a lot since a lot of times it was never previously established in his training but I guess most people are satisfied by seeing cool thing happen on screen with pretty colours and good animation. The power system has little explanation and we can't reasonably fill in the gaps that were left. We have no idea how advanced Tanjiro is besides when he defeats a demon that others supposedly can't but we don't see much of people taking on threats that Tanjiro can take out. It's hard to compare where everyone is in terms of power, if certain breathing techniques are more powerful than others and why, if they're just different ways to fight, how much have they improved overtime, why breathing affects the power of their swordsmanship in the first place. To make things worse, we have the swords and the different colours of the swords and Tanjiro gets a black sword which is just said to be bad luck possibly because anyone that had a black sword doesn't live long but we don't know any real quality of it and that doesn't seem to apply to Tanjiro so what does the sword actually do and why is it so rare. Why does Tanjiro see ghosts when he had to slice the boulder? They were clearly real people that existed as established by the guy in the mask's reaction to Tanjiro describing them and yet he's never seen them and there's no other instance of this happening throughout the show nor is it ever mentioned in passing by anyone so I guess we just have to assume that that can happen yet no one else but Tanjiro in the show has had experience with that and Tanjiro has only seen those 2 for a short period of time because he had to learn how to overcome the challenge of the boulder somehow and that was the only way the writers came up with where that happened and it also shows that the guy in the mask cares for his students and it informs us of the powerful demon Tanjiro faces in the trial to become a demon slayer since that demon killed them apparently, yet they showed up at their master's place and not there where they actually died and there's no reasoning for that and we're just supposed to accept that this thing happened I guess. Why does Kibutsuji just kill the lower moons besides the most powerful one? He says he isn't satisfied with their power and whatnot but wouldn't it just make more sense to have all of them so they could overwhelm the opposing forces instead of just sending in the one guy to prove his worth? But no, I guess we have to see that Kibutsuji is a badass and doesn't accept any failure or mediocrity and just kills fools without batting an eye instead of being a character that makes decisions informed by experience, values or even logic. Kibutsuji is afraid of Tanjiro because of his experience with Tanjiro's father which he knows due to the Hanafuda earrings he has yet he doesn't just send his most powerful demons to kill Tanjiro or even go after Tanjiro himself while he hasn't become that much of a threat yet? Why did him and Tanjiro even meet at all? it causes so many problems since now Kibutsuji is aware of his existence and sees him as a potential threat yet doesn't really do anything about it besides what goes on in Mugen train but like, he could do so much more and could've done stuff like that much earlier. Before i forget, there's also the issue of the demon slayer organization not being recognized by the government which was a throwaway line early in the show. This makes no sense for very similar reasons as to why Tanjiro not believing in demons doesn't make sense. In our world that would make sense since who would believe that when there are so many different explanations for so many different things and there's so much information in circulation based on things we have proven and can prove so if a group of guys suddenly say demons exist and are a problem so we formed an organization for slaying demons, no one would believe that shit and they would probably be imprisoned or be but on some sort of blacklist for being unstable individuals that are dangerous and have weapons. In the demon slayer world they live in fucking FEUDAL JAPAN where folklore, mythology, yokai, wive's tails were all in their prime, with many people genuinely believing in the supernatural not to mention most of the public we see in the demon slayer world just knowing that demons exist and call upon them to exterminate demons. We never see any naysayers or doubters or sceptics in this world saying demons aren't real or that the demon slayer organization is a bunch of crazy people or a bunch of scammers or anything like that. How does the government think the organization stays afloat? If the government doesn't recognize them as a real organization, how has the government also not gone after them for any of their activity or limit them in any way? Why would the government just leave them be to do whatever they want if they don't recognize them as an organization? Surely there've been enough reports of people singing the demon slayers' praises and saying they deal with this huge problem and that there are many witnesses to demons terrorizing people and demon slayers getting rid of them. Are you also saying that no higher up of the government thinks demons are real and have never seen demon activity or someone slaying a demon or haven't been in conversation where people talk about their experience with demons and the demon slayers dealing with the problem? Do they just think it's some crazy elaborate scam? If they do, why haven't they done anything to deal with them? Why did the show say this at all when it never comes into play in the story or world in any way? Literally a throwaway line that brings up so many questions without any answers and makes absolutely no sense in the world of the show and isn't ever brought up again or shown in anyway so the line wasn't even needed. Ok, I'm done now I think. Most of these ""problems"" I mentioned aren't a big deal with the exception of Nezuko and how the power system works and how they did the training. Everything else is just a nitpick really but I think it's important to explore all the problems, even if minute since they add up and make the experience worse when added up like this. If all I had were nitpicks and not actual problems, then I probably wouldn't even be talking about this show in the first place.
The Demons (Themes and Ideas)
This show is about forgiveness and showing kindness even to the worst people. Every demon has a sad, sappy backstory that is supposed to make you feel bad about them and understand how they came to be where they are which is just absurd. I couldn't believe how they tried to make you feel for the spider kid where he strongarmed the other spider demons into forming a pseudo family that they're all miserable in because he killed his parents due to his demonic urges or some shit like that and the pain from that brought him to where he is now like bruh. That was so bad and the one where the guy with the drum things was a writer and there was a guy who shat on his writing all the time or some shit so that when Tanjiro avoided stepping on his writing, he got distracted by that kindness which allowed Tanjiro to give the death blow. Both of these examples I feel show how this message is so bad since they try to get us feel sympathetic to these characters and not just see them as ""demons"" despite the leap in levels of grief or isolation or guilt or sadness or anger felt by their backstories and where they are now is so impossibly huge. How am I supposed to feel bad for the spider kid at all when he killed so many people and forced those around him to be in agony to the point where that one female spider demon welcomed death as Tanjiro was about to slice her head off which he did in such a way where she wouldn't feel the pain because he recognized that she was welcoming it and wasn't fighting back. I remember that demon Tanjiro faced at the trial to become a demon slayer also having some sort of sad backstory and i remember it crying and Tanjiro actually feeling bad for it which is just so absurd to me. It's all about seeing the other side and understanding where the villains are coming from and feeling bad for where they ended up since they could've gone in a different, much better direction but since they weren't shown kindness or lost things dear to them, they couldn't love and became these angry, miserable beasts. I feel like this is very undercut by Tanjiro just straight up killing them even though he feels bad for them but that's just me I guess and obviously they don't show the sad backstory for every demon as they didn't do it in Mugen train and others that I don't remember but it's still very absurd. At a point, you have to ask yourself why even show these sad backstory moments with these demon characters if it doesn't really play into the show in any way or is reflected by any character's arc or story. The answer to that question is to show how kind and patient and tolerant Tanjiro is because Tanjiro is infallable and a good boy who shows kindness to everyone no matter how bad they are.
The Characters
Alright, time to talk about how atrocious Zenitsu is. Now, I think the concept of having a reluctant soldier whose forced to join the fight and doesn't really want any part in it is a fine concept but they butchered it terribly with Zenitsu. Any member in a war is a reluctant participant. Just that some people push through it and enter gladly for the sake of protecting their families or land or country, etc. Someone being miserable the whole time while engaging in the war is grating to watch. Yes, you were forced into this position and have every right to be scared, have regrets and complain, but goddamn you don't have to go into screaming fits every other second, be a creep in general and inhibit others in battle. Plus his voice is also irritating, just the screechiness of it and how much it cracks and shit is really hard to sit through. There's a difference between a character like Shinji and a character like Zenitsu which kinda have the same base concept. Shinji has a character and I understand his reasoning for why he acts the way he does and I get things from his point of view. I don't know who Zenitsu is besides a cowardly, pervert reluctantly participating in battle, I know nothing of his character and that makes him infinitely more insufferable. If Zenitsu had a character, I'd probably be chill with him. I'd bet they'd even change stuff about how he acts and whatnot if they really tried to give him a character as well. Zenitsu doesn't go through any type of change but Shinji goes through change a lot, he has ups and downs, he progresses and regresses, Zenitsu is in just one constant state that just gets both boring and annoying to watch overtime as it is extremely repetetive. I feel like Zenitsu doesn't fit as comic relief in a show like Demon Slayer where it feels that characters are supposed to represent wish fulfilment and there's foils to it like some of the asshole slayers we see contrasted with Tanjiro making Tanjiro even more admirable, someone like Inosuke who learns to grow, appreciate and show compassion due to Tanjiro and then there's Zenitsu who is by Tanjiro just because he likes him and how he's so nice and wants him to be around to protect him while he acts like a whiny baby and it feels like we're supposed to like him for that which feels bizarre especially considering he doesn't change. Like with Rengoku or whatever the flame guy was called, he was obviously also another wish fulfillment character with admirable traits being very positive all the time, full of energy and highly skilled, so admirable that even Tanjiro, the most admirable person in the show thus far, looks up to him. So he fits right in the mould also and both Tanjiro and Inosuke learn and grow because of him and have more motivation to do better and have a reignited vigour for going into battle. Zenitsu on the other hand feels like he's only there to feed off of others, give nothing back and doesn't learn or grow from it and yet we're supposed to like him. He's just a parasite of a person who only does something beneficial when he isn't doing it consciously. He obviously isn't JUST a comic relief character either. He's a main stay in the show and it's obvious we're meant to grow attached to him and like him. Purely comic relief things in the show would be the guy with the weird mask in season 1 that makes the swords or the way the crows talk which is supposed to be somewhat comedic. Zenitsu just feels like a part that doesn't belong with the whole, a part of the machine that serves no purpose and if you get rid of it, the machine keeps running at full capacity, maybe even a higher capacity than before since the part that got took out only ever got in the way instead of playing a role. I don't find him funny because the ""humour"" of his character is based on how he's a perverted creep and a whiny, scared person who gets frightened by everything and hinders everyone around him so it's never funny, it just reminds me of how shit of a person he is which isn't funny in this instance since characters' reactions to him aren't particularly funny and his reactions to their reactions is usually just ignoring them and continuing or him feeling hurt since they don't see him in the right. It's not funny, it's genuinely sad, ugly and gross. The humour of him being a person with bad qualities that always gets in the way doesn't work in the context of the show, nor is it executed competently for what the jokes are supposed to be imo. Even with his one admirable trait of being resilient/stubborn/persevering like in his training to learn the one technique and eventually perfecting it, waiting through the poison he got from the spider and fighting through it, keeping it back the whole time, as well as the time he protected Nezuko from Inosuke or whoever was kicking him because it was important to Tanjiro, he feels like the literal definition of a toxic friendship. He only serves to hold people back and bring them down and acts very selfishly and only complains without ever contributing anything but you keep him around because you pity him and every once in a while he does something good for you as opposed to the rest/overwhelming majority of the time where he's useless and not even fun to be around and you don't want him to fend for himself because you don't think he'll get far nor is there any chance he'll get any better or grow on his own. Him fighting unconsciously is not cool or good. He's not actively doing anything which I mentioned before. Just shuts off and lets his reflexes do the work which would be cool if he did that on purpose but he doesn't, making it so much worse. How well he could fight doesn't matter in terms of his character. Him fighting consciously wouldn't even mean every fight would finish quickly, he could be afraid of fighting and still fight which means he won't reach the point he does when he's unconscious and his mind is clear so he'd be on the same level as the others. That could be a thing. Or they could've done his story differently, the story didn't have to be the way it was. Everyone in this show had a hard life, Tanjiro's entire family was murdered and he places guilt from that on his shoulders because he felt he should've been there for them and now shoulders the burden of Nezuko to try and heal her, Idgaf about how sad Zenitsu's life is. No wonder he has no friends or anything, he's clearly non-sociable because he doesn't have admirable qualities and his relationship with his sensei is only good because it needs to be since he's training him to be in battle and he admires Zenitsu's resiliance and perseverance so he's rooting for him, he doesn't like him for his personality at all. I find his relationship with Nezuko really creepy because he doesn't know her at all and just leaps for her getting ready to love her and be in a relationship with her despite Tanjro obviously having somewhat of a problem with that and her being unwilling to even say anything or show her personality meaning he doesn't get to know her at all nor can she really just consent to anything, he just forces the love onto her and I find that gross. Does Zenitsu ever fight conscious? Like even once? How can I root for him to be better when he doesn't make active decisions to be better or improve anything about himself overtime? Tanjiro may shine from Zenitsu because it shows how tolerant and accepting Tanjiro is but it sure dulls Zenitsu showing how disgusting he is. Rant over.
Conclusion
Demon Slayer is an alright show with mostly passable (but unfunny), inoffensive comedy, a story that doesn't do anything new and is very simple so everyone could follow along with it, very basic, one-note characters that you would see in most shows which is carried by it's excellent animation and art brought by ufotable. It has many flaws in terms of it's story, especially as it relates to the lore of the world of the show, Zenitsu is an awful character and nothing in the show stands out besides it's art and animation which I feel isn't even that much of a selling point since a show like Jujutsu Kaisen also has excellent art and animation but actually has other things that are interesting and engaging such as the characters and themes and ideas whereas Demon Slayer falls flat on all of those fronts. It's easy to get caught up in hype and action so that's where Demon Slayers excels since it has memorable moments in its exciting and well animated fight scenes that many people buy into and enjoy immensely, making it a well loved show in addition to the vanilla goody two-shoes character of Tanjiro, the excitable, tough and rough Inosuke and for some reason, the comedy of Zenitsu.

                A nekketsu in the making, a different and entertaining shonen.
This anime is worth it, I would say that it is the best of the season, however, I think nobody could fully explain the reasons why it is a special and interesting shonen to watch.
The first reason is that it has a different and entertaining plot set in the Taishô era, which in itself as in the remake of the anime 'Dororo' provides historical vibes of a Japan characterized by a period populated by demonic creatures own of typical Japanese mythology. So, if you enjoy this type of mythological animes and past ages, this different touch
                  will like you as much as I do.
As a second point, our main character is mature, focused, kind and with a great sense of responsibility for their loved ones and life. This type of adult characteristics and the tragedy that must face give us a character of a shonen in opinion: different and attractive. The fights exacerbate the logical capacities of the characters when confronting the demons, which avoids highlighting only force as the main trump card at the time of a fight. The training is progressive, the fatigue and are not appreciated 'power up's', splendid techniques of katanas are shown with a considerably different art.
Third noteworthy point of this anime is that, just as the drama of the tragedy also has hints of humor that relax the atmosphere and seriousness of the fight scenes. Anyway, we can enjoy the enemies and the evil reflected from the demons as something relative, where the kindness of Tanjirô evokes the compassion of the observer, particularly, I think that this is something unique within the nekketsu shonens that I have been seeing, excluding the anime Magi: The lybirythn of magic and its sequel.
Fourth point, the animation, drawings, music and script as well as the enjoyment of the development of the story are adequate and progressive. The work is remarkably pleasant and with details or failures that can be overlooked or almost not noticed. Without exaggerated details is an anime that is worthwhile and in terms of quality, offers entertainment, action, a compelling plot and desire for support and growth by the main character, a condiment inevitable for a shonen.
Without more to say, I hope you give this anime a chance, since I think that in itself, it would deserve to have indefinite animation given its captivating characters of plot and animation.

                Kimetsu no Yaiba isn't absolutely perfect, but it sure is close. I wish I could give it a 9.5 because it really is that close.
The art and animation is beautiful, the music is incredible, and it's just overall a must-watch. I felt a kind of excitement watching this show that I haven't felt since watching Hunter x Hunter. 
Tanjiro is a refreshing protagonist. He doesn't fight with ""the power of friendship"" like a lot of other shounen protagonists, he trains incredibly hard to acquire the power necessary to slay demons. The demons he faces all have interesting abilities as well. It makes for exhilarating fight
                  scenes. The sort of partnership that Tanjiro has with his sister Nezuko is refreshing to see as well. She's no damsel in distress, and they both have moments where they save each other. As for the others, they're all pretty great. Zenitsu is probably my least favourite character and he is pretty annoying on the surface: a classic pervy dude who hits on every girl in sight (think Mineta from BNHA) and is also incredibly cowardly and whiny, but even he has his heartwarming moments and badass moments.

                SO FAR, this anime is really great. It has action starting quite early on, but not an overwhelming amount and it just slowly builds up. The way the story is presented and given is done at a nice pace where you can get constant story telling about either Tanjirou or any of the other great characters. Demon Slayer has all kinds of characters, from the kind ones to the scared ones to the arrogant ones and the list of what the characters represents is great. So far it isn't that long and is quite easy to watch and very simple to follow along and you
                  won't get lost with it. This anime has some of the best fighting in any anime that I've ever seen, with some of the best sword fights in anime. It really keeps you engaged without constantly dragging you away from it for unnecessary reasons. It liked to build on the stories of everyone, including villains that are side villains and it makes you understand them more as opposed to being thrown with ""They were evil just because"".",9,Scary-Milky

                After watching 25 episodes of this anime,I realised that this is typical shounen anime,just with more funny content...I like anime story,art and characters...The only thing i don't like about anime is Sound quality (I am not sure if its me or anime) but thats about it!I recommend everyone to watch even if you are not anime fan...This is really good anime and I expect soo much of 26th episode(last episode)!
For story i think its great...Or should I say AWESOME!It has all elements that anime story should have!Lot of effort is put to it and its visible!I enjoyed anime so much and if it doesn't end

                Good old action that makes your heart pump and root for these bunch of idiots running around with swords.
The story isn't anything to write home about, but making it as bare bones as it is makes the characters shine through. 
Eventually.
At the beginning we only have tanjiro to help us through the first episodes, and some nezuko tidbits that I can't stress enough how much I appreciate them (seriously, this girl will make your heart melt, I don't care who you are)
Tanjiro isn't a bad character per se, and when he's surrounded with people he is able to really play to their strengths and make
                  the whole friendship much more dynamic. But when he's alone (and he is for most part of the beginning) the poor boy can't carry the series.
However, as more people are introduced , the series completely picks up pace and our enjoyment just goes through the roof as each person brings something new and interesting to the table.
The art and sound just makes it into a neat package that makes this series a breeze to watch through.",7,Spindleglass

                It's hard to rate this anime because it shines so much in its animation and enjoyment factor.
I liked the anime because it was very entertaining and the art was ""fresh"", it really keeps the action scenes feel good. But when we are more critical about the series overall, the concept isn't ""new"" and the story / characters aren't that good or memorable, a side from the artwork and animation of action scenes this plays out like a typical shounen anime, including the ""miracles"" that everyone somehow survives while the bad guys perish.
You can enjoy this anime if you're willing to ignore the flaws in the
                  story and its characters. 
I also didn't enjoy the comedy being forced in rather serious ""life or death"" situations, or more the ""change into comedy art style"" during those situations. Comedy is fine, but changing the art style to fit the comedy was a bit aggravating for me. 
I would've liked to see Kimetsu No Yaiba be a bit more like Basilik.",6,Vorleser

                The story was not all that, it's pretty cliche as far as anime go and sometimes the dialogue felt drawn out to me. The characters are likeable but not very well-developed; at the very least they are creatively drawn and each one has some kind of backstory. Where this anime really shines is the art, it's so beautiful! There are some parts that look as if real life was combined with animation (honestly I can't tell for sure). I am also a sucker for badass-looking bad guys in anime and this one has a lot of them! There's also a good amount of comedic scenes
                  thrown in there to lighten the mood so it never gets too heavy.

                If you have ever seen a shounen anime and dedicated some time to thinking about what makes these shows tick, Demon Slayer will offer absolutely nothing new for you. There is not a single creative idea in it. You might be thinking: ""I don't care about creative - I just want something that's slick and well executed"". The problem with that, is that you could still do way better than this. 
Given the (alleged) physical superiority of the demons, I was hoping we would see the main characters playing it smart and using some underhanded tactics to defeat their enemies, but no. In Demon Slayer,
                  if a problem can not be solved by hitting it you need to hit it harder. Everything will be settled through brute force and through getting stronger, which really just blurs the line between the two sides in this particular conflict. It doesn't feel like you are watching humans that have to work around their physical limitations to fight these threatening monsters - which, I thought, was the entire appeal of this. It is super heroes versus super villains.
A huge chunk of the show's audio track consists of the characters' inner monologue that will make absolutely sure that the audience really, really knows what is going on. There are no interesting methods of conveying thoughts or emotions through anything visual, other than someone occasionally shedding some tears. They didn't even try in this regard. Demon Slayer is ""tell, don't show"" brought to such an extreme, that I can't think of a single show right now that was worse in this regard.
If all you care about is decent animation quality and dumb action, you might get something out of this. For anything beyond that, I'd look elsewhere.",3,Graine

                Demon Slayer doesn’t break the action-anime mold, but it’s a truly astonishing series that shows the potential of the medium and why it’s been steadily increasing in popularity throughout the world over these past few years. The tale of teenager Tanjiro seeking out the monstrous demon that slaughtered his family and a cure for his sister’s tragic transformation was one that had me on the edge of my seat almost every step of the way, even when I could tell where it was going. It’s full of endearing characters that elicit laughs and genuine emotion in equal measure, features a beautiful, moving score, and each
                  phenomenal fight sequence is practically a work of art thanks to the absolutely stunning animation from the acclaimed studio Ufotable, delivering what is almost certainly their best work yet.

                Have you ever seen a show that’s bad, but bad in an interesting way, so you’re compelled to watch it? Like picking at a scab even though you know you’re not supposed to. That show is Demon Slayer for me. It is so close to being good that it’s frustrating to watch. This makes its flaws stand out. There are basic flaws in logic and storytelling 101 that could have easily been fixed. It reminded me of Fullmetal Alchemist, but with nothing to say and if the author was making it up as she went along. There are a few good things. It bends the
                  typical shonen formula, the water effect when Tanjiro uses his abilities looks great, and some of the fights were interesting. It was often funny in a so-bad-it’s-good way. It could have been good; it really could have. But the flaws were just too much to ignore.",1,toastalchemist

                I remember first seeing this anime during spring 2019 and I didn’t pay much attention to it. However after watching this, it simply blew me away. Overall, this show was an excellent representation of the shounen genre. I also enjoyed how the villains in the show aren’t just one sided. Normally you would expect for a villain to be simply just bad without much explanation. However this show managed to explain how and why the villain became a villain and it allows you to sympathise with the villain as well. The chemistry between tanjiro and nezuko was also great seeing how the relationship between them
                  was not sexualised unlike the many anime shows in the recent years. On the other hand, some people might be criticising for the plain storywriting or the generic main character tragic background. Though the story may be slightly plain at once, it is simple enough to understand and sophisticated enough to not make it boring. After all, the aim of any show is to be easily understood by all ages. I watched some shows that unnecessarily complicates itself and hence I feel at times that simplicity is key.Most importantly, the animation in this show was what made it so good. The way they managed to make a battle scene looked so appealing and intense simply left me without words.
In conclusion, if you enjoy watching beautiful fight scenes coupled with some comedy, then this is the show for you.

                although Demon Slayer has a generic shounen plot it uses this to its advantage to create a very entertaining show which is also artisticaly abundant.
Story: 7 Good
It's not special but it's very compelling. Especially when it's told through characters. The fact that Tanjirou treats Inosuke and Zenitsu as his brothers and shows much kindness to them is a great way to tell a story through character, because he lost his family, all of it except Nezuko to which he feels a duty, the duty to save her and protect her makes it more compelling.
Art: 10 Outstanding
Demon Slayer has a very unique and outstanding art style.
                  It manages to transform fight scenes into it's own form of art. Each fight scene is like a dance, very fluid and gente but also intense and explosive and also distinctive from the other. Unlike other anime where we just see flurries of punches or weapon strikes Tanjiro has to adapt in real time to the moves and tactics of the enemy and find out ways to defeat him and dodge his attacks mid battle and the animation is also very fluid instead of choppy.
Sound: 8 Very Good
I can't say much about sound since it doesn't play an important part but the voice acting is amazing and the traditional japanese chore music gives it a creepy aura
Character: 9 Great
All the characters have traits which make them unique and makes the interactions between them very fun and wild because why would it not. Tanjiro, which acts like the older brother, very caring and self disciplined and willing to make the improve themselves, Zenitsu who is the youngest brother in this trio or relationship always scared and about to piss his pants, but also a good person willing to do his best, well the best he can, and Inosuke who is a wild unschooled child who grew as an orfan most likely in poverty. Inosuke never shies from saying stupid things or challenging others to a fight and only wants to prove his physical strenght. And all those 3 make for a trio of idiots but it's idiots I loved seeing on screen together. And Nezuko of course ( Even tho she is a plot device  for our main character ) is still great and a cute and innocent character but also one with a will of iron.
Enjoyment: 10 Outstanding
It was extremely entertaining, especially because it's a well made battle shounen maybe a little to tense at some parts that I had to skip to see what happens faster.
Overall: 9 Great

                Demon Slayer is the defintion of great visuals with no substance. The story plays out like your typical fighting shounen formula, except in this case, the writing is subpar and terribly predictable. The formula is as follows:
1) Something bad happens to the protagonist: In this show, there was absolutely no build up for the tragedy. His entire family gets slaughtered right away in the first episode.
2) Protagonist sets out on a quest to avenge his family: This pretty much defines the goal of the entire series, even though the ending of the series as a whole can already be pictured: Tanjirou, the Main character, kills
                  the Bad guy™. But in Demon Slayer, you need to be constantly reminded of the goal by Tanjirou through his inner dialogues. Not only is it frustrating to the viewer, but it also diminishes any form of story and character development. The story has only one objective, and its main character has only one personality that he constantly boasts about.
3) Obligatory training arc: Instead of having the main character immediately fight battles which gradually become more challenging and interesting, while he slowly learns from his past mistakes, overcome his weaknesses and become a bit stronger after each battle, the series decides to slap you with a boring training arc instead. Said arc won't matter in the long run since Tanjirou pulls out completely different techniques out of his ass that weren't explored even the slightest in the training.
4) Episodic battles. Nothing can be said here other than its the selling point of the series, pretty much. It's solely the visuals, the choreography, the cool special effects applied in the fighting sequences that got everyone's attention. Yes, the battles are cool. They are entertaining to some extent, but can also become quite predictable and sometimes inexplicable, but we'll get to that point later.
So the story isn't something special, but isn't bad or unbearable either. It's pretty generic and straightforward, and any shonen fan can quickly pick up where the story is going at, what is it aiming for and why. The issues lie with the characters and the writing, or should I say the lack of it.
Tanjirou is presented as a typical scout boy, always wanting to do the right thing, regardless if it backfires on him. This makes him relatable and consequently, easy to root for. On the other hand, the supporting character are downright annoying and completely unnecessary. I think everyone can agree that Zenitsu shouldn't even exist. I heard that many people dropped the series because of his unbearable characterization. And to be honest, they were not wrong. Zenitsu does absolutely nothing in the series, and doesn't bring anything special to the table. Instead, he constantly fulminates and cries out of fear before someone manages to save him. I remember a peculiar scene which I found pretty bizarre and rather funny. Zenitsu was accompanying a kid (and not the other way around) and at some point the kid becomes annoyed of Zenitsu's childish and scaredy-cat personality. So I guess the series is self-ware of the issue in having this character in the first place, but proceeds nonetheless just to have a pointless comic relief device and fill some unnecessary screen times here and there so it can drag the story even further. But here's the thing: having a comic relief character in this series plummets the seriousness of the whole plot, not to mention its tragic nature. We're talking about people getting brutally slaughtered and teared apart at one end, and watching Zenitsu make a move on the protagonist's sister who is a demon at the other end. And Zenitsu cannot stand demons, let alone look them in the eye! Even if the story somehow requires a form of comedy to ease the tension, having a character whining and complaining at everything that moves doesn't equate comedy.
Some scenes honestly don't make any sense. I'm not talking about the fighting scenes, because by definition they shouldn't make any sense in this context since the fighting system was not completely fleshed out and fully explained. I'm talking about a memorable scene where the characters left Zenitsu and went inside the forest like it's a normal, everyday-thing to do. They left a scary, good-for-nothing character by himself because he didn't want to accompany them in the suspicious forest. Later on, he decides to join them, not because he suddenly felt the urge to save them or act bravely. But because he suddenly felt like he wanted to save Nezuko, the protagonist's sister... The scene is absurd, almost funny in bad way, since Nezuko doesn't need saving!
Speaking of Nezuko, she acts more like a weapon than a character. She doesn't speak, doesn't protest, and conveniently saves his brother whenever needed, almost like she's a plot device or something. Now you may be wondering, how is it possible for a demon to be tamed and not attack anyone, even though the premise first states that it's impossible to do so and there's no turning back for them. Turns out, there is: just have an old man BRAINWASH Nezuko into thinking humans are good, off screen, while Tanjirou is training outside, without his consent of anything. I mean, who knows what else the old man ""forced"" Nezuko to do and not to do. This alone proves the poor writing aspect of the show. Since demons can be saved after all, why the hell are you trying to kill them?
Moreover, demons are first presented as monsters who needs human blood to survive. NEEDS. It's a necessity. But somehow, Nezuko doesn't. She only needs a bit of sleep and it's all good. Now I can think of many ways to make this more plausible, say having Nezuko drink animal blood, or drink Tanjirou's (this in turn can somewhat explain the natural and non-hostile connection they have by drinking a blood from a kin instead of brainwashing her off-screen!).
I almost forgot the other supporting character: Inosuke. He comes second in the most unbearable character in this show after Zenitsu. He is constantly shouting at everything and everyone and acts in a rude and animalistic way. There's a scene where the characters are having a funeral and Inosuke refuses to help them bury the corpses, highlighting the fact that he doesn't respect the dead, so they resort to convincing him to do so!
Delete the supporting characters and Demon Slayer would have been twice as better at least, since the poor writing is mostly related to those characters. 
Then comes Muzan, the villain of the story. The following part contain a minor spoiler so feel free to skip it:
*SPOILER*
Muzan is one-dimensionally evil, killing innocent people so he can drink their blood and gain powers, but at the same time extremely weak and fails as a leader who has a good sense of strategy and thinking. In the final episodes, he slaughters all his soldiers due to their incompetence of defeating the main character and leaves only one guy, simply because he liked his way of thinking. At first, the show heavily emphasized on the ""12 Demon Moons"", basically stronger demons who work directly under Muzan. So one would think that as the story progresses, the demon moons will get defeated one by one before arriving at Muzan himself. The writer realizes this troublesome issue himself: he needs to write at least 12 arcs, much like popular shonen shows are doing, one arc for each villain. So instead, he forces Muzan to kill his OWN ARMY, leaving only one Demon Moon. Not only is it lame and out-of-character for any reasonable villain, but it also makes said villain appear extremely weak and nonthreatening. I mean he pretty much did Tanjirou's work himself. This does not prove his ruthlessness and cunning character, it's the quite the opposite: it makes him look stupid since he's unable to manage his ""resources"" efficiently.
So now, instead of having a proper build up for the villain in a form of ladder, each step revolving around defeating a Demon Moon, you now have a ladder for toddlers with only one step. And the villain is also a toddler himself.
*END*
Despite all of those glaring issues (obviously, I can give more examples regarding more plot inconsistencies but I believe the ones that I gave are more than enough to give you a general idea of the poor writing and characterization), the show still manages to be entertaining at some point. This is mainly due to the animation aspect: the fighting sequences are smooth, with many special effects applied almost like fireworks, especially during the cool fighting techniques used by the characters. Even the CGI doesn't look that bad to be honest. As for the sound, the OP is good and fits the nature of the show quite well. I don't really remember the ED. The voice acting and background music are also decent, nothing memorable or outstanding by any means.
So should you check out Demon Slayer after all? Sure, if you want to watch some cool but predicate battles with amazing visuals. But don't get your hopes up expecting an excellent story, unforgettable characters and threatening villain. In short, the TL;DR is as follows:
(+) GOOD
- Acceptable protagonist with a clear motive
- Amazing visuals and animation
- Fitting BGM, decent voice acting
(~) MIXED
- Battles are entertaining but predictable
- Protagonist can become annoying sometimes
(-)
- Terrible supporting characters
- Writing is subpar
- Boring one-dimensional villain who doesn't act like a proper one",6,misterbadluck

                This is my first review on anything and I don’t wanna bore you by trying to sound like in intellectual with articulate quotes or word play so ill start by saying that this ”review” if you can call it that is essentially me building off of a thought dump of the overall problems with the show and a gist of what it could’ve done to make it the “masterpiece”, COMPARED TO OTHER SHOUNEN, that a lot of people call it:
————————————————————————————————————————-
Thought Dump:
Show had potential to build upon the aspects, lore, and themes that would make it special and deferential but never does or does but not
                  to an adequate enough degree that sticks and could’ve benefited from an arc or two to build upon them, the show also had a rather incredibly fast paced prologue that could also play into my prior notion but also including the characters as well, while this could also be said for the whole series as some characters come off as annoying and not to be taken seriously bc they are the butt of a lot of jokes with the whole gist of the joke being based around annoying character traits. Another gripe I have with the show Is it feels like everything falls into tanjiros hand and he never really has to put effort towards furthering his goals and the plot which is usually found in short shows
————————————————————————————————————————
What To Take From The Thought Dump: 
I would be lying if I said the show didn’t have aspects that would make it different from other shounen but the way it handles them really makes them obsolete as the show progresses, this is why the show would’ve benefited from a longer run time or in the case of the source material, arcs or at least something of the sorts to build upon themes that the show strays away from or vaguely hints at or touches upon. For example: the show could’ve atleast tackled themes of humanity and blurred the lines between who’s truly the good guy and the bad guys like Hunter x Hunter did by putting you in the shoes of the  “bad guys” just to find out that some of them aren’t so bad and that it wasn’t their choice to made the way they were. Demon slayer does this in a more subtle way as in the the humanity of the demons only shows in death which doesn’t change the fact that they are still pieces of shit when they were alive. The characters remain static and unchanging as they never really grow because of the earlier statement of the shows short nature.
————————————————————————————————————————Conclusion:
The potential of a show doesn’t and shouldn’t make the show and kimetsu no yaiba is no exception of a show with wasted potential to be great. 
————————————————————————————————————————
Final Score:6/10
Because: it had things that pushed it above being an average shounen but never really did enough to push it into the boundaries of a “good” shounen.",6,-Rayne-

                Ambivalence is a powerful key to telling a great story.  Not the indisputable fact that Samurais are awesome as fuck, not the cast of unique and memorable characters, and not Demon Slayer being the Next Big Shounen.  It's ambivalence.  And boy, does this anime get dynamic with it.
To start out, the driving force of the plot IS ambivalence.  Terror/sympathy?  Check.
A timid character is repeatedly forced into the most terrifying positions imaginable.  Comedy/horror?  Check.
A 180 transformation in emotional state that is simultaneously drop-dead hilarious and sad.  Comedy/chill tragedy?  Check. 
Of course, Kimetsu no Yaiba is not the
                  first anime to explore these themes, but I think it does so quite elegantly, even subtly.  It's not on the nose, as it were.

                Kimetsu no Yaiba, or the art of having an interesting and serious synopsis, an oustanding realisation (thanks to Ufotable) but more importantly, the art of always take some time and effort to ruin everything.
We follow the path of Tanjirô and his sister Nezuko, in the Japanese folk era. The country is populated with Yokai but few people really acknowledge their existence. Only the Demon Slayers, a group of highly trained warriors are capable of slaying them and prevent them from devastating the human world.
The story itself is really interesting. If i had only watched the first two episode, i would have said that this anime
                  is a must to watch show. But hey, life is not that simple. 
What this anime miserably fail over and over is to set a serious mood when it is needed. The thing is the main story is kind of a dark fantasy. We have horrible monsters controlled by a mysterious and evil creature (who looks like Michael Jackson, at least it made me laugh). And well, i get it, sometimes it's good to have a pleasant note to make something sad and cruel a little more enjoyable. But this anime fail MISERABLY at doing it.
When there are people dying, when Tanjirô is fighting a human-eating monstreous creature and everything is serious, the last thing i want is cheerful characters doing ridiculous jokes. You have to choice for god sake, you can't have a ridiculous AND deadly scene in the same time. Imagine something like the movie ""The Green Mile"" but in dead serious scene there is someone disguised like a clown doing autistic screeching.
I haven't speak of the characters yet. Without spoilers, i can say that the main protagonist is something like a ""Marie-Sue with a really really R-E-A-L-L-Y good nose"" . Like, you remember the iconic ""Sharingan"" from Naruto who let his user analyse everyone and predict what they will do. Tanjirô do this with... his nose. And be ready because he will use this ""power"" every second he can. 
Nezuko is really interesting. She is the most important character for the story of the protagonist and is well written. The link between the two is good and pleasant to watch. The two other main characters are the reason why this anime is never serious more than 5 minutes. If you are interested in the story you are gonna hate them.
And this is it. You take a good lore, gorgeous animation and horrible choices of mood setting and boom. You have something painful to watch.",4,Blackuroe

Firstly, the visuals are fantastic, with a lot of vibrant colours and some stunning backdrops. This anime also has CGI that is very well done most of the time, fitting the art style of the rest of the show perfectly and making some fight scenes truly great to watch.

                THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE.
The studio behind Fate Zero has done this one, and it's just as impressive and wonderful.
The story however is rather simple, nothing you haven't encountered before in this medium or another. The pacing is all right in itself, but there's not a lot to work with given that it's a series expected to be fleshed out thoroughly in many episodes so a predictable rise to the characters to becoming renowned Demon Slayers is one of no surprises in this genre. 
The artwork however is some of the best in the business. Every scene is shown with such detail that you can
                  tell they've done a wonderful job and we're very lucky to have anime of such high quality around. From the character details, to the ambience of every location all the way to the incredible battles where the digital artstyle gives them a life of their own. Most definitely the best thing about the series.
The sound work is respectable - the timing and stillness of some scenes to give importance to the voice over are certainly the best bit of their work. Track choices for important and developing scenes are quite good too, though the downfall is that some of the others are too quiet. It disrupts the flow sometimes. Voice acting is very good with noticeable love given in battle scenes.
The characters are memorable, intelligent and believable. The MC is an example of a shounen anime MC being done right. He's level-headed, creative, resilient to a point where he'd fit for a dwarf in a Tolkien setting. The side characters each have their own troubles and developments and are quite likeable and a great addition to the series. The villains are given scene time and fulfilled with a backstory which gives their lives meaning. 
Overall, I would say definitely give this one a go - it's the first season of a presumably long run and it's a good introduction and base to work from. I expect it will only get better from here, so sit in and enjoy the ride.

                Just going to jot down a few random things because  I honestly don't have enough to say about the series to bother with some clever or organized review structure.
This show really reminds me of MHA. Both are fine series without any major 'flaws', but despite getting praised as the greatest achievements of mankind, neither really bring much new to the table besides great action animation and character design. 
The story and its structure aren't particularly unique, and even plenty of the battle concepts are pretty familiar. By the end of the show I was begging for an end to all the lame tragic backstories.
                  The character designs are unique and mostly appealing, but the characters themselves are mostly one note and by the end, the series has introduced three characters who all annoyingly scream just about everything they say. 
Ufotable is definitely one of the master studios when it comes to CG integration, and it shows when they use that to their advantage, but when they use it as a means of streamlining background characters or less important things instead of elevating a scene, the models always stick out like a sore thumb.
Otherwise, it's a perfectly functional series I've seen hundreds of times. Nothing wrong with that, but not a lot to praise or talk about, honestly.",6,Aum_Pinata_Party

                Let's jump in why I scored Kimetsu no Yaiba 10/10 overall.
Story: The concept of slaying demons isn't original. We have plenty of animanga who did it first (e.g. Nura: Rise of the Yokai Clan, Twin Star Exorcists, D.Gray-Man, etc.), but it doesn't matter who did it first. But the way, Kimetsu no Yaib executed the story that made it something unique than your average demon-slaying only. I like how Kamado, Tanjirou (the protagonist) was driven to turn Kamado, Nezuko (his little sister) back into a normal human and cut the cycle of humans being killed or being demons. While he sympathizes with the demons who
                  despaired and repented, that will not stop him from killing them after what they've done.
Art: I'm no art expert, but the art is fine and unique. Good job, Koyoharu Gotouge. As long as the art is tolerable, it's an automatic 10 for me.
Sound: The sound. The freakin' sound is one of the main reasons why I stayed for Kimetsu no Yaiba. Each soundtrack keeps me hype every time they build up some surprising, dramatic, epic, or tension-filled moments. These soundtracks reminded me of my favorite video game of all time: NieR:Automata.
Character: Each character has their own individuality and morals which keep them set apart. Once again, good job, Koyoharu Gotouge.
Enjoyment: Every episode the enjoyment I feel doesn't disappear as it become my favorite all time shounen anime.",10,yukithefool

I believe others have elaborated on this anime for it's wonderful art and poor story. Maybe it's more accurate to say its unoriginal and uninspired. And that's really what's happening here, 15-22yo's who have seen 5 to 100 anime find this to be breathtaking. Where as those 30yo+ who have seen 750+ Anime find it to be nothing special. There are of course exceptions and generational divides are nothing new, but you might consider which you are before deciding to watch.
The motley crew has a guy whose dense but capable, strategic (MC), and to wrap it up, another annoying character who will spend most of
                  his time whining, crying, and being all around useless. God, can we just get rid of this character trope...
The show gives off pretty strong Inuyasha vibes, spider demons, demon's being led by a mastermind who made them Naraku type. The sword changing colors isn't much different than Inuyasha's changing forms. All we really lack is Kagome yelling Inuyasha 10x an episode. Maybe that's why they chose not to have her speak, tho we get to hear Nezuko a lot. ""Working with our sworn enemy"" trope has been done to death. A Good Demon.. my word cinematic brilliance!
Which it was pretty obvious his father was a flame Hashira with all the flashbacks and what not. MAL covered ""the episode that broke the internet"" which is what made me watch this in the first place... super predictable and underwhelming. ""Let me guess, his sword turns red?"" Oh look at that, it did. Cool...
All that being said, the movie was in an all together different league, definitely watch that.",3,R307R

                Demon Slayer is a typical shounen type show. That being said, it's focus only stunning animation, a proper atmospheric soundtrack, and good use of its cast turn it into a reasonably enjoyable show.
Demon slayer's story is very ""monster of the week,"" so they do have to make the most of the fights. There is the main storyline going on in the background. It, unfortunately, moves at a glacial pace right up till the end of the first season.
Tanjiro is the resolute, kind protagonist, and his mood and feelings felt infectious. It just starts to sway you, and any character is he is around. He very
                  much loves his sister, which is why he is on this journey in the first place. Zenitsu is very much a character that starts annoying as crap, but they give him a decent chunk of character development, and he does grow on you though the series.  Inosuke is fun in his own way through; he is bullheaded impulsive, always trying to prove something but well-meaning.  He always tries to pick fights with Tanjiro despite  Tanjiro's naivete preventing him from realizing that. 
To say demon slayers animation is stunning would be an understatement. The show is beautiful, and for the most part, the fights are very fluid. Of course, there the famous scene from episode 19 that needs no introduction. The soundtrack suits it well, often fitting the tone of the scene.

Art 10: The art and animation on the other hand IS outstanding, the style they use fits perfectly with the show and look amazing, especially at certain points. 
Sound 9: The sound also fits in well and the opening theme song is one of the best for the past few seasons (spring - summer - autumn 2019)
Characters 9: I find all the characters
                  that are meant to be likable to be such and all the characters serve their own purpose and serve it well they do. The certain character(s?, dunno if this could be a spoiler) that are meant to instill fear do so well.
Enjoyment 9: Overall the enjoyment of this show is a solid 9, it is structured well and not every episode ends on a cliff hanger to try and keep you wanting more, rather you enjoy it so much you want more anyway. I would say (without spoilers) in the anime the enjoyment levels probably peaked at 10 at a certain episode that everyone knows of.
Overall 9: I believe that overall this is a very well polished and refined anime that works solidly without trying anything completely new but rather perfecting what is already there.

                Well, I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed. As someone who has previously enjoyed Shonens such as Naruto, HxH, Dragon Ball, etc., I was pretty confident I would also be a fan of Demon Slayer. I was wrong. The story is about as basic as it comes and the same can be said about the characters. Tanjiro, the protagonist, has borderline no personality and there's really nothing to him except for the fact that he's talented at everything for some unexplained reason and a good person which makes for a pretty one-dimensional and boring main character. The villains are all extremely forgettable and when
                  they bother to try and give them a backstory it's as thin as paper and doesn't provide any real depth to them. The side characters are so cliche they feel like characters straight out of One Punch Man making fun of Shonen tropes which gets really annoying really fast.
With all that being said this show isn't totally irredeemable. I'm rarely a big fan of CGI in anime but it's used really well here making for a really nice-looking show. On top of that, some of the fight scenes are pretty fun to look at even if they don't have a lot of creativity behind them. The ending wasn't bad either doing a solid job at wrapping this season up and preparing for the movie.",4,Chess00

Demon Slayer stars Tanjirou Kamada a young man living with his family in the mountains after heading off on an errand to a local village he returns to find his family murdered by a demon with only his sister still alive but tragically she is now a demon.
After meeting a demon hunter he sets off to become a demon hunter determined to get revenge for his family and if possible turn his sister back into a human, however Tanjirou soon discovers how tough his training is with two years of tough training under his master passing by before he even attempts the entrance exam.
A
                  really good story does an excellent job of telling Tanjirou's story and his progression as a character and the improvement he makes as a Demon Hunter. The ending to me was disappointing and was clearly done to set up a movie in the future, if it was to set up an upcoming 2nd season it probably would have been better.

The development of Tenjirou is excellent and the way the back story of the demons is told is very well done I also liked some of the other Demon Hunter's with Shinobu Kochou one of the senior Demon Hunter's being a personal favourite.
My only issue here is I wasn't a massive fan of a couple of Tanjirou's colleagues in particular Zenitsu who is a cry baby and Inosuke is hot headed to the point of complete recklessness.

Besically he fights with the demons, as the name say, he kills demons.
His family was killed and that's why he bacem a demon slayer.
The character design is so pretty and colors are magical.They have some techniques - breathing techniques and demon blood art and scenes where you can see that are magical!

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is proof you don’t always have to reinvent the wheel to make a great anime.
Story: 7
Probably the weakest part of the show. It’s not bad, just a fairly run-of-the-mill shounen story. If you read the synopsis, you should have a really good idea of what you’re getting into. Tanjirou returns home to find his sister Nezuko turned into and demon and the rest of his entire family murdered by demons. This leads him to the decision to try to turn his sister Nezuko back into a human, and in the process, become an actual “demon slayer”. And thus the adventure begins. It’s
                  a pretty basic, and quite slow-moving, story, but it does the job.
Art: 10
Never, ever doubt UFOTABLE. They absolutely crushed it. This series has some of the most visually-stunning fight scenes in anime history. I’m sure others will mention this too, but episode 19 in particular blew my freakin’ mind. The way it seems the “camera” shifts, the fluidity of the movements, the beautiful effects of each of their elemental sword attacks. It’s just all so, so good. What a treat to my eyes this was.
Sound: 10
The voice acting was terrific across the board. Even Zenitsu, whose voice was hard on my eyes at times. I think it was supposed to be. The main cast were all really well-performed, but Saori Hayami’s performance as Shinobu was especially memorable.
And the music. Both the OP and ED were outstanding, but so was the music that played throughout the series. I know I’ve already mentioned it before, but the song played during the climax of episode 19: phenomenal. Seriously, chills.
Character: 8
The cast grows, but it’s Tanjrou, Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke that get most of the screen time this season. The quartet is solid, but at times hit-or-miss. Tanjirou is very much the standard battle shounen protagonist. Determined, kind-hearted, hard-working, motivated by his friends and family, etc. It’s not a deal-breaker, but his character isn’t exactly ground-breaking. Nezuko, despite being gagged to protect humans in case sudden cravings arrive, provides a great deal of charm to the series. Her facial expressions and mannerisms, especially when no one is looking, are usually entertaining. 
Zenitsu is the character that’s been hit-or-miss for me personally. The way he acts around girls is reminiscent of Brock from Pokemon, except with more frenetic energy. There are times when he calms down and I think he’s making progress, but then slides back into that ogling, desperate character I don't love. Then we have Inosuke. He might be my personal favorite character in the show. He’s introduced as wild, shouting shirtless boy wearing a boar mask. But when he drops the facade and shows genuine admiration for other characters, it’s quite endearing.
I don’t really have enough information to analyze the newer characters, but there are some intriguing ones among the rest of the cast. The Michael Jackson look alike, Muzan, and the sweet but deadly Shinobu are the standouts for me. I thank the creator for the latter’s “ara ara sayonara” line.
Enjoyment: 10
As you might notice if you check out my profile, I’m getting up there in age (28 as of writing this), and every time I think I might be growing out of battle shounen anime, something like this comes along, and I find myself feeling the way I did was a kid watching DBZ in the early 2000s. Episode 19 invoked similar emotions in me as certain DBZ scenes that are near and dear to my heart. I had a terrific time basically from start to finish, and a few incredibly “hype” moments really put it over the top for me.
Overall: 9
Yes, the story and its characters are not exactly revolutionary. But wow was it executed to near-perfection. Regardless of how old you are, whether you’re a guy or girl, this is an anime you have to watch. And if you like a good fight scene, brace yourself.",9,axel360

                Kimetsu no Yaiba may seem like another typically shounen-ish anime, but I gotta say it is a few shounen anime I could enjoy.

Typical shounen anime: you have an MC who lost everything and swear to avenge his beloved family's death against the villain. Fast-paced story line

                An extraordinary anime for an above average shonen.
I recommend the show with all my heart, the sound design, the amazing 3D animation that is used in conjunction with hand drawn and the sheer dread one can feel while observing some fights is done perfectly! 
I came in expecting this to be another Tokyo Ghoul-esque anime, but it is nothing like those edgefests. For starters the MC is a completely average shonen protagonist, the sometimes disturbing story still has comedic portions to it which stops it from being depressing.
The main cast altogether is a blast and their interractions with eachother are gold. You have the hard-working
                  one, the cowardly one and the aggressive one, and of course bestgirl of the damn universe. All with their own set of goals relating to their personalities.
The villains are realistic and while vile and horrid, they do have emotions and personalities. Some of the time this show legitimately made me teary-eyed with the villains' backstories, of course the amazing soundtrack sealing the deal.
This adaption is the ultimate goal any show should have, beating its manga counterpart 100-1. 
The powersystem for this series is a bit lacking, but as this is just the first season it is excusable, in essence consisting of two varieries of superpowers. The demons have their own abilities and the demonslayers have a set amount of diffrent techniques.
Character development has not been lacking in the slightest, making the originally bland supporting cast into a respectable one.
Though possibly a bit overhyped this series deserves the praise it is getting, can't wait for the surely coming second season!",9,DEEDSHOT_R

                Kimetsu no Yaiba was a very conflicting anime for me to watch. It's stellar art pushed me to keep watching but the storyline says otherwise. I'll be covering the parts I enjoyed about this series first, then cover the turn-offs later
This point has no doubt been made time and time again but it's absolutely necessary to give ufotable the praise they deserve. The animation is stunning, and as someone who has read the manga, the character design really brings justice to the original manga. Fight scenes are dynamic, there is no shaky cam, there is a clear direction of the flow of fights and it
                  blends together beautifully. Even in messier fights, it is still very easy for the viewer to follow along. The beautiful effects in each of the breathing styles really make you feel excitement whenever they perform a technique. 
The audio isn't as breathtaking but it certainly fits the mood. I think the voice actors did a good job conveying the personality of each character; albeit slightly exaggerated. 
The worldbuilding in this show deserves a shoutout too. It's obvious that effort has been put in to give materials and items in the show a sense of uniqueness and place in the world. Items in the show are provided with names and context, and even how they came to be. For example, the swords the demon slayers use are so potent because they're made of a specific metal. It's a small detail but I appreciate it nonetheless. 
The second thing I greatly enjoyed is the main "" magic system "" in this show. Demon slayers utilize breathing techniques to help them defeat demons. It's a unique system and its suited for the world it's set in. I think the breathing system is believable to an extent as it focuses around the idea of concentrating oxygen and strengthening the body; basically magical doping. It's not over the top and the breathing styles aren't actually magical, the water breathing style doesn't actually create water, it just resembles the flowing nature of water. This is something that you have to pick up yourself because in the first few episodes I misunderstood the art and assumed that the slashes actually produce water, but its just the effects. Anyways, the system is pretty balanced and because it's such a basic concept with no mind-blowing magic tricks, it really sets the parameters for fight scenes.
Now here comes the criticism, buckle your seatbelts. 
The characters are just so underdeveloped. They have unique traits and originally, this was going to be a compliment as the characters all have very good character design and quirky traits that set them apart. Unfortunately as the series progresses, it became apparent that the unique traits they have were the only traits. Most of the characters are literal representations of their traits. Zenitsu is cowardly, Inosuke is headstrong, Tanjiro is the shonen mc, having an unbreakable will. There's no problem with them having these traits, but these are the few traits they have. There has been an attempt to give them backstories, but throughout this season their annoying quirks have stuck like glue. In literally every scene, you can see zenitsu being whimpish and cowardly, to a point where it becomes annoying. He has so much potential that unfortunately did not manifest in this season. This also applies to the other characters, namely the ones we see at the later episodes, when this group of high level demon slayers are introduced, we see each of them having a single punchline or characteristic that they keep repeating over and over and over again. There's this guy who is absent minded and forgetful, and the show tries so hard to show that. It comes to the point where there's a heated discussion going on and it just breaks away to this guy staring at clouds. It breaks the tension and makes me feel annoyed. Everyone of the character there has a terrible first impression on me because of the way the show decided to display their characteristics. 
Another example of this is the heated discussion I mentioned, it had amazing potential to display the beliefs of each character but instead they're given one liners with little explanations. What would have been an amazing platform for us to see what drives each character and what beliefs they have got turned into a puddle of one-lined dribble. Each character tends to have a catchphrase that they'll repeat over and over and I can assure you that it's really irritating. I know that this is just the initial impression of these characters and they'll be fleshed out later, but the initial reaction is not good.
The next qualm I have is the overall structure of the show. When I first watched it, the thing that shocked me was the sudden timeskip. There's a time jump of 2 years that happened within a few minutes of the first few episodes. There were a couple of cuts showing the MC training but otherwise, I think the time skip was really executed poorly. Such a huge jump in time makes the viewer feel disengaged from the story. There is no reference for the viewer to associate time to so we're forced to accept the fact that 2 years has just passed and the MC spent that time training and now he's stronger. Some may argue that the show wanted to have less focus on the training montage but I personally feel that it's a huge wasted opportunity. Such a big time jump could have been used to a greater extent to develop the MC but instead he it just became a way for the MC to start off strong. 
Another thing is that ties into this is the fact that moments earlier, we see his family dying and a series of events unfolding, then suddenly a 2 year timeskip. This convolution could've been avoided if they framed this whole thing as a flashback instead, the tragic events of his family and the training. If the show had started with this, then the 2 year timeskip wouldn't be a timeskip, it'll be a jump back to the present moment, and it'll be much more coherent for the viewer.
Another issue I have that is not exclusive to KNY, but to alot of shows, especially isekai shows, is the fact that his family is so underdeveloped and their deaths so predictable. We barely get to know his family ( it doesn't help that he has a lot of siblings ) before they get slaughtered within the first 5 minutes of the anime. It's such a shame because its predictable and a lot of emotional impact could've been added if they had chosen to spend more time building on his relationship with him family. 
The first episode feels like an exposition dump and every single character feels like they have no purpose other than to dump information. When tanjiro goes to the village in the first few minutes, his interactions with the villagers are just absolutely terrible. The characters seemed to have no purpose other than to tell the viewer that tanjiro has a good sense of smell, he's a hardworking boy, he's trusted by the village. The way they go around it is so direct, literally they have the villagers tell us that tanjiro has a good sense of smell. And if that wasn't bad enough, when he was going up the mountain an old man appears and introduces us to demons, even though storywise, it's weird that after years of living in the mountain, tanjiro still hasn't met s single demon or even heard of them until that point. He even doubts the old man! That entire scene feels unbearable because of how forced it is. And as usual, the dialogue doesn't help. This is a line that tanjiro actually says. "" Oh don't worry I have s good sense of smell after all "". He says that to the old man in the context of getting lost in the mountain. It just feels weird for the MC to tell us his abilities, when it would have been so much more impactful if we saw it instead of him telling us. 
To round this off I'll like to talk about the part that irritates me the most, the demons themselves. The demons themselves have a good premise, all demons were once humans, they burn in sunlight and are super strong. This kind of reminds me of the hollows from bleach in that the demons are supposed to be relatable because they were once humans, but the show ruined the potential by its poor storytelling. For some reason, backstory appears just moments before the demons die, giving the viewers just mere moments to emphatize with them. What is the point of this? Isn't the point of backstory to build the character of the demons so their deaths are more impactful? Putting them moments before they die does absolutely nothing. The idea was admirable but the execution was terrible. Thankfully, so far I have not seen an instance of sunlight plot armor, where the sun just comes up just as the protagonists are about to lose a fight. Their weakness to sunlight is actually an important aspect as it will be shown later on in the manga and it's an aspect I'm actually impressed with. The story hasn't used that weakness as a deus ex machina excuse to pull our protagonists out of nasty situations. But that's just about it, the demons are subpar so far and they aren't very strong villains.
The final part I want to touch on is tanjiro and nezuko. Now I have no problems with nezuko not being able to speak or sleeping for 2 years, those are just tiny qualms that I don't think are important. What is important however is the fact that nezuko is a plot armor. She comes out of the box whenever she's required and other than that she has little impact on the story. Compound this with the fact that she literally has zero personality besides being cute and being protective of her brother. There are scenes where they show human nezuko being protective and sacrificing her own welfare for her siblings but that's a flashback, we don't see nezuko displaying any of that later on. We don't know her personality much because she rarely talks or interact with the characters. Another thing is how she has been brainwashed to "" protect humans and to treat them as family "". That part is just a spit in the face to character development. So we're supposed to just take it that nezuko, a demon is well behaved because she slept for a long time and the whole time some dude told her to love Humans so now she's well behaved. This was such a wasted opportunity to develop nezuko. She could've been a full blown demon at the start, and over time transition into a more humanlike form due to tanjiros overwhelming support and dedication. But no, nezuko becomes well behaved because some dude whispered in her ear for 2 years. And the final kicker is how she gets flashbacks of her family, and the show expects the viewer to feel touched when we literally have no clue the relationship she has with their mother, or their individual siblings. 
Overall, would I still recommend this show to someone? Yes, I actually would. Despite the complaints I have, it doesn't make this show trash, because alot of the issues are common in another shows too, however it's not revolutionary or perfect in any way as the fans have been hyping it up to be. It's enjoyable enough because of the shonen formula and it's art style and the wide array of characters are engaging enough to continue watching. I think someone who doesn't really care about the plot will enjoy this show tremendously because of the episode structure.",6,SuperZecton

                This review contains almost no spoilers. 
I found Kimetsu No Yaiba really interesting in the sense of its godly execution and unique clean art style, however, i found the storyline disappointing and i also found the plot boring up until later episodes, and i was seriously on the verge of dropping it. 
The villians are one of the reasons why i got hooked to this anime later on, it's rare for me to find villians that are really terrifying by all means and that have strong auras such as muzan, i liked some characters really nicely written.
But for a person like me who cares more
                  about the plot more than the animation, i thought it was a waste to make all that amazing work for an anime with such a poor script.

                Imagine this, you lose your entire family to a demon and your sister has been turned into one. Now you have to go on an adventure to find a cure. 
There is not much to this plot idea in fact many shows have done something similar and failed, but this anime right here does it well. With amazing art and character development its no wonder, this became a hit. This show does so much with almost every character in so little time. It makes you sympathetic to not only the MC but almost all the characters even the annoying ones. The enemies aren't just these
                  faceless demons, most of them have some sort of backstory and motive which makes them appear more human than they actually are. The overall emotion I got by watching this was joy. There wasn't a single moment where I felt a lull in the pacing of the anime. There didn't seem to be a lot of padding either.
TLDR: Great anime due to the treatment of all characters and pacing",9,Azeem_Shariff

                Interesting anime, with a good proposal that meets the requirements, at times it's kind of lost in explaining why monsters are like that, leaving only a few flashbacks to pass on their death, which doesn't make us totally empathetic towards the villains, but in the Overall a great anime to pass the time, not to mention the animation that is extremely beautiful and its impactful soundtrack.
some things don't make sense if you stop to think, like in the first episode where Tanjirou literally forgets about his family and starts calling only his sister without even getting into a deeper despair which would be normal for
                  a situation like that. Aside from the fact that some fights are boring.
In total i would say that it is a good anime, but that it gained a lot of fame due to the hype.

                Kimetsu no Yaiba (at least, the first season) it's an average shonen with nothing exceptional but the art and animation.
The pace of the season is good but the characters are normal. Nothing special here.
The sister of the main character has become a demon and he became a demon slayer, not to kill her but to save her. She became a demon because some Michael Jackson-based villain is the top demon in the world and -we don't know why yet- he attacked that lonely family in the mountains. After that our hero with a good sense of smell -we don't know why he has that- trains
                  like hell and achieve something called the breath techniques or something like that, which are the main power all the demon slayers have.
But the main character doesn't learn something and the same for his friends.
The plot's always using the voice in-off so we don't have to think on our own, instead, the director is always telling us what happened.
Overall enjoyment is an easy 8 because sometimes can give you a smile or a laugh and the art it's always great to see.",8,agus_tidona

                Don't worry, I'll get to talking about Episode 19.  This wouldn't exactly be a real 'Kimetsu no Yaiba' review without it, now would it?
Story:
Born to a charcoal selling family, Kamado Tanjirou sets off one day to sell charcoal to earn money for his family consisting of his mother and several siblings so they can survive the winter.  After a busy day, he is forced to stay at a neighbor's house in order to keep himself safe from Demons, creatures that devour humans when night falls.  Upon returning home the next morning, he finds out that his entire family has been slaughtered save for his younger
                  sister Nezuko, who has been turned into a Demon herself.  Now Tanjirou resolves to find the one responsible by joining the Demon Slayer Corps and turn his only surviving family member back into a human.
Compared to most modern Shonen, Kimetsu no Yaiba prides itself by having comparatively smaller, more personal stakes for its cast.  Tanjirou's main goal for the entire series is to turn Nezuko back into a human.  Sure there're other things that have to be accomplished along the way for that to happen, for the most part, that's what our protagonist is shooting for.  This among other backstories that illustrate how other members of the cast got to where they are paints more personal stories that end up flooding the story as a series of character-driven tragic events instead of an all-out brawl where action and fights become the main focus of the series.
This kind of storytelling extends itself even further by treating the various Demons we meet in the series in a similar manner, putting their level of importance almost on par with the human characters and Tanjirou due to the Demons' nature of being previously human prior to them becoming creatures of the night.
Despite the quality story beats Kimetsu no Yaiba has during its highest points, the story structure can still be largely attributed to being like your typical action Shonen.  Training arcs are surprisingly commonplace, and much of the enemy encounters for Tanjirou exist as monster of the week battles which expand itself into full arc encounters as they slowly take over and defeat each successive Demon they encounter, escalating them ever so slightly thanks to the series's innate Demon hierarchy of the 'Twelve Demon Moons'.  They also ended up throwing in a couple more characters in order to serve as the 'companion' characters for Tanjirou's journey, which actually left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth the moment they were introduced and persisted.
And because not everything can be so moody and serious, comedy is plentiful in this show, which I actually don't mind all that much even if it does cut the tension in half like a hot knife through butter sometimes.  Most of it is really exaggeration comedy for the sake of blowing situations out of proportion in a ridiculous manner, but it works well, for the most part.  Especially in the ending cards where the characters jump out of the pages of their manga and give helpful Taisho tips to the audience because why not?
Overall, Kimetsu no Yaiba has a solid story that while bogged down slightly because of its shonen story structure, has a lot to love because of its smaller and more personal stakes that detail this one boy's journey without turning him into a god.  If it makes any amount of sense, the story feels a lot more 'real' by comparison to other examples in the genre due to Tanjirou's slow progression and need to train and recover from the times he pushes himself too hard.  It's nice and I feel like not as many series' do that and instead opt out for giving the MC a massive powerspike because that's how they build up hype.
Characters:
I've already praised Tanjirou a lot for being a more down to earth and simple-minded protagonist compared to other contemporaries.  His goal of turning his sister back into a human remains as his primary motivation for the entire series, being the backbone as to why he becomes stronger and hunts down the Demon Moons.  But what makes him feel like a worthwhile protagonist is his compassion.  Most if not all of Tanjirou's wins are mercy killings, granting the Demons he kills solace and peace as they dissipate into dust.  For me, I find this interesting as it shows that he does things out of necessity and these fights that he engages in always seem to have either moments of solace or tranquility instead of triumph, helping to bolster his stance as a protagonist worth rooting for.
On the flip side is his little sister Nezuko.  Now, Nezuko is a cute.  Characters in the series knows she's a cute.  Hell, the show itself knows she's a cute, and does whatever they can to make her look and act like the cute she is.  But she feels very lacking as the show's secondary protagonist.  She has drastically less screentime than Tanjirou does, and owes a lot of her presence in the show to Tanjirou always talking about or driving himself to trying to turn her back into a human.  She does have several key scenes where she participates in fights in tandem with her brother to show that they are indeed in-sync, but a majority of her screentime beyond that has her either sleeping, or acting as cute as she possibly can with dot eyes and muffled mouth noises because of the bamboo over her mouth.  When (not if) this show gets a second season, I hope her issue of relevancy gets resolved.
And now we get to Tanjirou's companion characters, Zenitsu and Inosuke.  If I may be honest, I wish this story was just about the two siblings.  Zenitsu and Inosuke serve the dual roles of the comic relief and the lancer to Tanjirou respectively, both of whom are awkwardly put into the series at the same time and stay in it as we get to know them.  To the show's credit, there're some good nuggets of growth and backstory that appears for each of them in the arc after they're introduced, which does well to flesh out and ease them into the series without much issue.  However what really irks me is how harshly the series turns from a lone swordsman with his sister in a box seeking revenge into a group of friends going to save the world in a matter of 3 episodes thanks to them.  It's a really dramatic shift I'm not really fond of, made even less so thanks to Zenitsu's constant, constant, CONSTANT shouting and blubbering.  I get you're not the most mentally stable of the bunch, but shut up and let me think for a second goddamnit!  Inosuke's becomes more tolerable as the episodes roll by so I find him less irritating by comparison, but he as well helps to create that uncomfortably dramatic shift in tone.
In terms of other human characters, the cast is split into either the Hashira, elite demon slayers who mostly rely primarily on eccentric personality in order to make much of a splash since their appearances are primarily saved for the end of the series, and any other demon slayers/characters that follow suit under or above their command.  Kanao, Urokodaki, Shinobu (and maybe Giyu) among other characters are the only ones worth noting since they both come prepackaged with backstories and baggage, but beyond that, no one else is really much is worth noting since they're mostly shrouded in mystery by this point.
Demons by comparison are a lot more involved and interesting.  Because of the show's 'monster of the week' setup, major demons come with a myriad of abilities and appearances, resulting in more intricate battles where the fight choreography changes and shifts each week to accomodate with the special 'Blood Arts' that they may have.  Not only that, but because of Tanjirou's innate compassion towards his enemies, a number of them also have backstories and tragedies to take note of, which in turn create more sympathetic villains that're killed out of necessity rather than just to satiate bloodlust or vengeance.  The Twelve Demon Moons escalate this concept more, having by comparison, more involved stories and better fights/powers which only make the show more of a spectacle than before.
The only Demon shown that's really lacking is Muzan, the series's final boss that only shows up a grand total of 2 episodes early on in the series.  It's hard to really evaluate him right now since it's obvious the show's going for a big reveal with a lot of lore and backstory down the line, but he's shown/talked about so rarely that I nearly forgot he existed until his name came up again in one of the last couple episodes.  His stance currently is really just power flexing to show communicated by the fear he instills in his subordinates in addition to his the small nuggets of his cold nature.  I wish there was more to say, but as it stands right now, he might as well not exist.
Aesthetics:
And...Unlimited Budget Works strikes again.  Being blessed by the gods of Ufotable, Kimetsu no Yaiba's artwork and animation are both of such high quality that I find it EXTREMELY difficult to find anything that docks points on the sheer spectacle this show is on the visual end.  Complete with bold colors that make the characters pop out and the somewhat uneven linework to make the character look like figures in a painting, a lot of what we end up seeing in the anime is a staggering level above the original manga, which look stiffer and sometimes awkward by comparison.
Because Ufotable doesn't half ass any of their visual design, the animation is just as impressive to boot.  Using Ufotable's signature dynamic camera to manipulate the movements of the characters in either a three-dimensional space or a wide area, Kimetsu no Yaiba has multiple noteworthy fights involving the unique powers of the Demons to really make the choreography stand out.  And hell, I haven't even gotten to the Breath Styles.  Due to the power system in Kimetsu no Yaiba, most if not all of the moves and techniques employed by the various demon slayers bear this visual metaphor to help express the motions and flow of the sword slashes.  Whether it be butterflies, water, lightning, or fire, the expressiveness of the Breath Style motions help give that extra oomph to the animation and make it just that much more impressive in a show that already has a lot going for it in the art department.
The comedic stylings of the series are also worth noting due to how drastically different they are compared to the rest of the series.  A lot of it relies on quick, snappy animation in addition to quick out of model moments with exaggerated faces and emotions and thick, black outlines on the characters..  This is also where the show's usage of 'dot eyes' becomes prominent with Nezuko being the main owner of this eye type, as well as what I call 'doll' models since the way the characters are distorted make them look more like round wooden dolls with their eyes bugging out.  It's quite fun watching scenes like these unfold although I wish they were less prominent since the series spends a lot of its last couple episodes just doing this due to the way the story is set up.
And because we didn't have enough good points to talk about, the music is also just fucking good as well.  Like wow, they really did not spend any expense.  LiSA's ""Gurenge"" is a song I feel like rivals that of her work with the SAO series, being a song with a slow start up before rushing into the action with a mix of ups and downs in the beat and volume to give that sense of pushing forward towards Tanjirou's goal and overcoming adversity.  This, in conjunction with striking visuals, makes this a very memorable song that is among one of my favorites of the season.
The LiSA train doesn't stop here either.  Sung by her in a collaboration with FictionJunction, ""from the edge"" is a similar sounding yet more subdued version of its OP sister that keeps the tension and push/pull of the fights in the series's highest points while also just being a song to truly close out the show.  Personally I still prefer Gurenge, but this song is just as good in its own right and should not be looked over.  Similarly, the BGM should also not be looked over, as its traditional sounding tracks complete with Taiko drums and traditional vocals help set the mood for a series set in a time some time in the past.
Personal Enjoyment:
I had a lot of high expectations from Kimetsu no Yaiba.  Without knowing anything about it prior, my first impressions had me believing that it was a series worth watching, made even more so because Ufotable of all companies was producing it.  With such a staggering pillar in the animation industry behind this series, I could only wait with bated breath to see what I would end up witnessing.
And that moment came.  With all of the high points that I gave for this series thus far: the smaller scale of the story, the personal story and journey of its protagonist, the orgasmically good visuals and sound design, Sakuga, all of that came ahead once the show's 19th episode was put to air.  Every bit of what the series had was melded perfectly into one moment of fight choreography with so much weight behind it that I actually sat in genuine awe just...watching.  It's such a rare moment to just not have anything to say about it aside from suggesting the series as something to watch to other people because actually finding a moment that good in any series is almost impossible.  Like fuck, Ep. 19 made headlines.  HEADLINES.
Unfortunately however, the series still has a number of low points.  As cute as Nezuko is, her involvement in the series is very lacking, and Zenitsu among other characters is such a pathetic character that any good moments he has is severely outweighed by the sheer amount of screentime he has devoted to shouting either he doesn't want to die, he doesn't want to do this, do that, or he's upset at Tanjirou for being able to talk to girls without ever fixing his own attitude towards him.  Like come on!  His story is good and has potential!  Why does he HAVE to be a blithering idiot 90% of the time?  It's not funny; it's annoying!  The story also drags its feet after the spectacle of Episode 19, something I wish wasn't the case since about 7 weeks of not doing much feels a bit much especially with how well everything was paced prior.  But aside from that, there's still a lot to love here.
My recommendation here is really just to watch the series.  The story is for the most part well-paced with a likable protagonist with a simple and commendable goal in mind.  Combined with Ufotable's godlike ability to T-pose on the rest of the season and completely wreck most any other series with their infallible ability to produce the most visually stunning pieces possible in the realm of anime; like if nothing else watch it for that.  Shit's like moving painting in 1080p or higher on your screen.  Who wouldn't want that?",8,PyraXadon

                As we are reaching the end of this anime I thought I could throw in my two cent of what I think about this anime.
Firstly if you are new and don't know what this show is about I highly recommend it, it's easy to get into and not that long either. It's a pretty normal shounen but it was still very enjoyable. You can read what it's about and see if you wanna watch it yourself.
Now I'm gonna get into spoilers and such so don't read if you haven't caught up with the anime (only anime spoilers no manga spoilers).
The story itself isn't anything groundbreaking
                  which is fine because personally I don't like my stories overly complicated. Tanjirou himself is a pretty generic shounen main character as in he's energetic and happy like most main characters. My favourite thing about him has to be his kindness since that's the one thing that stood out from other shounen main characters, he always gives sympathy to the demons he faces even if they hurt him really badly which makes for some pretty emotional scenes which I loved. He cares deeply for his sister Nezuko which is shown in my favourite episode, episode 19 where uflotable flexes their beautiful animation alongside Kitou Akaris beautiful vocals in that episode we really got to see Tanjirou's fighting spirit and in the next episode again we see him show sympathy to Rui saying something along the lines of ""I would never trample on someone who use to be human"" that is what I think makes Tanjirou stand out from other main characters his kindness and sympathy, the show wouldn't be the same without it.
As for the other characters they were all pretty good, this is one anime where (besides demons and villains) I actually had no least favourite characters. I loved the scenes with Tanjirou, Zenitsu and Inosuke because they were always really funny. Speaking about Inosuke he ended up being my favourite even though he only showed up half way through. Zenitsu could be a little annoying at times but as we went on I didn't much mind it because we got to see scenes where he was passed out and like I said he makes the interactions with Tanjirou and Inosuke better.
Now lets see, the opening is a bop and my favourite song has to be ""Kamado Tanjirou No Uta"" which is what they payed during Tanjirou vs Rui. It's emotional and always gets me pumped up, it's pretty amazing.
My enjoyment for watching the show is a 10/10, It's been awhile since a really good shounen like this once has shown up, all the fight scenes were very good. The animation during those scenes were clean and it didn't feel rough (if that makes sense?) One Piece is my favourite shounen but even I can admit that sometimes during fights the animation feels wonky and a little messy but I never felt that during Demon Slayer it better win animation of the year istg. Can't wait to read the manga or watch season 2 if they make one.",9,Peach_Perfect

                Demon Slaying has never been this...serene.
LA coming into Kimetsu no Yaiba showed LOTS of promise but then it went into a dry-spell with it's build up, but THEN is when it REALLY got good. Some of the greatest things about Kimetsu no Yaiba was of it's beautiful animations, courtesy from ufotable and their amazing animation AND taking the norm from the typical shounen anime and doing something refreshing from it, mainly how the main character develops as well as the villains themselves.
Well first thing is first and that is our main duo, that of Tanjirou Kamado voiced by Natsuki Hanae the titular Demon Slayer and
                  his goal of finding a way of reverting his then demon little sister Nezuko voiced by Akari Kito back to a human and Tanjirou will do anything to find a cure, from becoming a demon slayer through grueling training, defeating demons and finding the person/demon who turned Nezuko to a demon. Tanjirou as a character is a great main protagonist though it takes time for that to get started, his main development comes from his views on the world as well as the demons he faces, especially with when he faces against a powerful demon and how he sympathizes with them in some way and in a ways, he gives the demons peace through the torment before and after they become a demon. 
Because Nezuko is one mute-ish when she becomes a demon almost form the start of the series, she sorta becomes a satellite character to Tanjirou BUT she gets some development, mainly for her becoming something of a manifestation of what demons are, but the other side of the coin as it were, in which that just because your being a demon, they needed to be slayed and Nezuko being the proof of it. 
Tanjirou does meet other characters into becoming the main trio, that of Zenistu Agatsuma voiced by Hiro Shimono, an absolute scaredy cat but somehow he's a demon slayer but HAS potential, BUT the biggest problem fro LA is about him is that his scaredy-cat nature though a running gag, gets annoying very quickly and it kinda sticks. He does gets development as the nature of how he is but nonetheless his scaredy-cat nature was his only detriment. On the other hand Inosuke Hashibira voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka has similar attribute to Zenistu just on the other side of the spectrum, as he's ALWAYS up for competition even in the most serious of moments, but he at least develops let alone it's not his only personality. So yeah...Tanjirou's companions have some flaws and makes his journey annoying but facing the demons themselves are a different matter. LA's favorite character?, well it's Shinobu Kochou one of the Captains of the Demo Killing Corps, she just had that air of regality but mysteriousness about her aaand she's voiced by Saori Hayami, what's not to like?
That of that these demons aren't like others and LA says this as the demons in Kimetsu no Yaiba are sympathetic, yes they kill humans for food or fun, but when we see their backstories before their final fights, you can actually sympathize with the demons in question and lay their grievance to rest when they disappear, so in a ways, it not only develops the main trio through the fights with the demons (be it fighting or personal development) but it ALSO gives the demons some serenity, some sympathy before they die, not something you usually see in a shounen anime as it's mostly a grey and grey to almost black and white mortality.
However our main villain Muzan Kibutsuji voiced by Toshihiko Seki is ANOTHER matter, mainly because he's a demon but wants to BE human, almost in direct contrast to Nezuko, its just his motives and his methods makes him an outright villain as he'll make a human turn demon just to hide from society as a demon, let alone his reach goes to even humans being in the lowest of the low and become demons to not only give himself a diversion, but gives a black view of ""peace"" or in the demons that become subordinates of him, give into their desire as chaotically as possible, not giving them the peace and regret to resolve, but them even saying his name means a death sentence, thus the demons Muzan converts...they are still stuck but have taken the deal with the devil as a last resort. The thing is because of the fact that Muzan hardly gets much screentime, we get more insight to how Muzan works even without him being on screen and again because of Muzan wanting to blend into human society his lack of screentime makes sense (well until the plot focuses on him).
The animation done by ufotable is great as to be expected from them, from the distinct character designs, awesome battles in which the animation seems to take cues from ukiyo-e Japanese paintings (and considering how much of a schizo-tech Kimetsu no Yaiba's world is like but still somewhat grounded in the Edo period). But Kimetsu no Yaiba's greatest strength in animation comes form the battles and man it's tense, bloody and many of the final outcomes, serene and the animation shows it gracefully. Yes Kimetsu no Yaiba does get into comedic situations and thus comical faces but it's a nice reprieve from the tense battles and again it's used for comedic purposes. ufotable really did an amazing job once again.
Voice acting was great with an amazing cast, from the solid unwavering Natsuki Hanae as Tanjirou, though Nezuko doesn't talk, Akari Kito did decently. Hiro Shimono though slightly annoying was good as Zenitsu and same goes for Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Inosuke. The other main cast such as Saori Hayami as Shinobu Kochou, Toshihiko Seki as Muzan, Kouki Uchiyama as Rui, Tamayo as Maaya Sakamoto and Takahiro Sakurai as Giyuu Tomoika, it's just a brilliant voice cast.
Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of the more surprising shounen animes to come out and no it's expected of ufotable to have it's gorgeous animation, where it lies in is in it's world building and character growth. Yes there are a few problems with the anime such as it's slow pacing and comedic relief characters and running gags and though Kimetsu no Yaiba hasn't finished as it finished with the Spider Demon Family arc and Tanijirou hasn't defeated Muzan let alone got Nezuko back into a human, with that it did, it's strengths even with it's flaws, was overwhelming. Kimetsu no Yaiba is getting a film to maybe or hopefully finish the story but nonetheless what this ""first season"" gave us was wholly satisfying all whilst being a refreshing breath of air for the shounen genre.",9,LegendAqua

                The dialogue in this show might be some of the worst of any show that I've ever seen, even worse than the last season of SAO. The way the characters speak and think is just dreadful, I can probably watch this show with my eyes closed because every action that occurs is said aloud by running commentary by Tanjiro.
Another big issue with this show is the blond kid, he is without a doubt the most annoying character of any TV show or anime that I've ever watched. Almost everytime he speaks, he is screaming some random shit which is just extremely unpleasant to watch and
                  listen to. I often find myself skipping forward; this is the only show where I have had to fast forward because I cannot stand listening to him. The other characters are mostly fine, it's just the blond kid.
The story itself is just very mediocre, nothing special and nothing garbage, although sometimes the entire plot is completely forgotten, I can't really explain it without giving spoilers though.
The music for some fight scenes is just very strange and not good.
One good thing is that this show is visually pleasing and the animation is good, but this is not enough to hide the awfully written dialogue and all the other crap. Another good thing is that this anime is very easy to watch/binge; this is because each episode is extremely short as 20% of each episode is 6 minutes of recap + intro + outro. The episodes also become shorter once you factor in the 2-3 minutes of skipping forward whenever the blond kid is on screen.",3,succusentericus

Story : 8/10
Nothing too special about the plot, its the classic hero/adventure anime we've all seen already, but I think the story unfolds well. The pacing is a bit off at times, especially with consecutive episodes just about training or traveling from one place to another. 
These episodes still are enjoyable to watch for the character interactions and light-hearted comedy, but the lack of action catches up to you after a while. I didn't dislike this aspect of
                  the show, but I'd understand if people said they did.
( Kinda reminds me of FMAB was paced, where we got a lot of character interaction and comedy for a while and nothing happened action-wise, and then we got a few episodes of a big fight )

Art : 9/10
The animation is beautiful throughout the entire series and everyone should appreciate the effort that went into making Demon Slayer so visually pleasing as it is. The characters look subtly unique and the landscapes are done well. And the fight scenes?? so so so so SO well done.
---
Characters : 9/10
Some people dislike the character because they lack various layers and only sticks to their one personality, and I can understand that. Make sure you take into consideration that this is only season one, so of course the characters aren't running at 100% yet.
Honestly, I loved all the characters, and it has been such a long time since I loved every single character of a show. Honestly though Tanjiro was going to annoy me, but you can't help but love him.

Overall : 9/10
For a first season, you can't deny that Demon Slayer has done a great job for itself. The plot, animation and characters are all amazing in their own ways and the OP is one of the greatest things I've heard ( thank you, LiSa! ) 
Demon Slayer is a great representation of what anime is, and what anime can do, for the people who are new to anime. You know how back in 2013 everyone and their mother's was talking about AOT, and how AOT brought a lot of new people into anime? Demon Slayer is doing the exact same thing.
A great sereies for people new to anime, and a great series for people who have been around for a while. Refreshing, easy to follow, and enjoyable to watch? What's not to like??

                The content of kimetsu no Yaiba is very Classic (frankly, it's trivial). Because it's still the classic main character, it's still the characters who fight the bad guys and win. Like many other shounen series, because the content of a shounen series is just the main character fighting with the wicked and then winning.
But it's because of the drawing and animation that make it stand out among the manga and anime forests that are being saturated. kimetsu no Yaiba appeared at that time as a breath of fresh air about shounen. So many people think that kimetsu no Yaiba is a PROJECT.
In my opinion, kimetsu
                  no Yaiba does not deserve the title of ""super product"". Because the content is not groundbreaking and the character building is still not really good to be considered a masterpiece.
But considering Kimetsu no Yaiba as an entertaining shounen anime, it's still worth a look. It's just overrated (this is just my personal opinion, not trying to offend anyone, please don't curse me :<)",7,Dawn_Hwongz

                Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Review
Story (8/10) Very Good  
Kimetsu No Yaiba's story for the arcs that were adapted in this 26 episodes were very good. A decent amount was accomplished and although I have not read the manga, as an anime-only, I wouldn't be surprised if this is better than the manga counterpart. The execution of the animation studio Ufotable was a jackpot as soon as it was announced that an anime was coming. Although they had their demon episodic type portions, looking back on it and analyzing everything that has occurred, it was only done up to a point where it didn't
                  start to feel like it was being a rinse and repeat type of formula that had no progression, those monster of the week type of shows that turn most off did not overstay it's welcome in hindsight here. From the overarching story you can tell that the best is yet to come and this is just the beginning and a very good one it was. 
Art and Animation (9/10) Great
Like I said in the previous section the moment Ufotable was announced as the animation studio it was gameset for this series to have at least one thing that wouldn't (disappoint for the most part). The only thing that is stopping me from giving this section the probably deserving 10 is the fact that there were indeed scenes that had CG in it that was not appealing. This is both surprising and disappointing because if there was one animation studio that I thought 100% of the time did their CG scenes (regardless of the scene) flawlessly it was Ufotable. This by no means ruins the anime, episode 19 itself makes up for it and will probably go down at the as the best episode in an anime for 2019 from an animation standpoint if you asked people. But overall it is a step down when you compare it to anything they've done with the Fate series even it these scenes I'm referring to are 2 to 3 seconds long Fate had Zero (Fate Zero heh). Point is that's all it can take to break the immersion that Ufotable worked so hard to create around you and immersion is extremely important.   
Sound (9/10) Great
Everything sound wise was great, JP Voice acting, the sound effects, the opening music and ending music were next skipped. The music that played during the anime wasn't anything that was memorable but it was fitting, not worth bragging about but not worth complaining about to any degree either. 
Characters (7/10) Good

The characters in Kimetsu no Yaiba at first were very jarring for me to be honest. I did not like any of them at first, Tanjuro was alright, Zenitsu was annoying af and Inosuke just reminded me of a shitty friend of mine animated before me. And all of them together at first took a long time for me to get use to because their chemistry and dialogue when it just those three is an acquired taste imo. They were loud, obnoxious, annoying, not funny and cringe worth to the max. It's like drinking alcohol for the first time (at least for me) it's not something I personally enjoyed from the get go. Their backstories and further characterization didn't help me like them anymore than I did either (except for Tanjuro it did a bit). It was only the repeated process and I guess heavy desensitization of their pure cooperative and overwhelming stupidity that surprisingly made me start to vaguely enjoy this unique trio. It took a while but by the time they entered the train at the end of the season I didn't mind their crazy charm. The other characters I thought were interesting enough and some of them got backstory was unique enough, nothing mind blowing but good enough for side characters. The villain was definitely hyped up for the entire season, especially in the final episode and his demon followers for the most part all kind of had the same backstory that tried to make you feel sorry for them in their last moments but didn't sell me on the sympathy that they thought I would give.         
Enjoyment (7/10) 
More Specifically (7.50/10)
My enjoyment of the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba for the most part was good enough. Sadly every week it came out I never reached a point where I was ever super hyped to sit down and watch the recent episode and there had been multiple times where I wouldn't even watch it for a week or 2. I'd let it build it because the motivation and excitement just wasn't there sadly. Enjoyment is the most subjective category and there's not much you can do to change it for someone so I'm just giving you my owns opinion on where my current level of enjoyment for this very good anime stood for it's entirety. It most likely had to do with the fact the characters for majority of the season I just couldn't click with. My friend asked me the other day who I thought was my favorite character and I first I was going to say no one because that was the honest truth but then I remembered Tomioka Giyuu.    
Overall (8/10) Very Good 
More Specifically (8.25/10) Very Good
I was looking forward to this anime more than most prior to it blowing up in popularity and came out far less enjoyed than most sadly. From a popularity standpoint if someone told me this anime is the most popular anime of 2019, I wouldn't disagree. But best? Now we can start a debate (Mob Pysco S2 and Vinland Saga has got some words for you). Nonetheless it is a very good anime and like I said earlier from a story standpoint the best is yet to come to future seasons (if we get them) I can definitely see myself giving them something in the realms of 9 but as of right now all of the sections averages out to an low 8 for me which is still very good.",8,Rikuson1

""What's good about this storyline anyway? I mean I kinda liked Jujutsu Kaisen's plot so why not?""
""Basically this person feels the need to avenge the loss of many people, so they randomly get a supportive teacher. Then the teacher teaches them and they become an official slayer. This person is breaking the rules though and should be decapitated

                Before I finished watching for myself I saw a couple of reviews saying the story wasn't great and while I respect the opinion I personally thought it was pretty good. 
It wasn't painfully complicated, it stuck to what it wanted to accomplish while being pleasant and amusing at times to give the viewer a little breath from the drearier stuff.
The characters were fun and unique both in personality and designs! (I loved Nezuko despite how little her presence was towards the end)
I'm not the biggest fan of shounen typically, and seeing how mainstream this anime was put me off of it for quite a while
                  but I see why it became so popular now, it's a super easy gateway anime for people to get more into the stuff.",9,Mobsicko

                This anime is both amazing and incredibly overrated. At the moment, it's ranked #7. I have read all of the manga (no spoilers will be given for the manga or anime past episode 1) and watched this regularly as it was coming out, and I got to see all the hype around it both online, while I was in Japan, and from people around me who don't even watch that much anime. 
Demon Slayer is a spectacular case of an anime where most of the credit should be given to Ufotable here. This is a prime example of a story that has such a unique
                  setting and artstyle be complimented absolutely perfectly by one of if not the best studios for animation there is.  
Art: 10/10 
So let's start from the best to worst, and as I said before, this is really why Demon Slayer is worth watching. The artwork and animation in Demon Slayer is without a doubt the best I have seen in years, if not the best I have ever seen. It is incredible how well the unique art style from the manga becomes so crisp in its anime counterpart. Everything is so incredibly fluid, with amazing use of colors that really pop without being too crazy. In many shonen, usually the smaller squad of main characters have a unique style to them, but in Demon Slayer, so many characters and backdrops are given so much detail and care, that look so much better when animated. I can't gush enough about how beautiful this anime is, and it doesn't stop with the visuals.  
Sound: 10/10  
The beauty of Demon Slayer continues with how well mixed and developed the soundtrack of Demon Slayer is. The opening is an absolute banger, the ending is great, the insert songs are emotional, the original soundtrack is unique and beautiful...I mean, I don't really know what else to say here. It's just really really well done, and compliments every fight in particular very well. As for sounds that are not as beautiful...  
Characters: 7/10  
The crying can be really obnoxious at times. If you've heard of this show, you may have heard of a character that cries a lot, which is grating but not really my biggest gripe with the characters in the show. Let's set this straight first - the characters in this show are good. They are very distinct from each other, and have their own tropes and traits that are very shonen. My gripe with the characters is how incredibly flat they are. Look, I don't expect crazy character development over 26 episodes. However, what I do expect is some growth, some change, something new from these characters besides learning new moves and techniques. These characters are so static that it becomes hard to really care about them if you don't like them at first, because chances are your opinion of them from the beginning won't change at all as the story goes. I can name a number of other shonen where by episode 26, there is some significant character changes and growth, and I'm sure you can think of some too. The characters in Demon Slayer are essentially really hard to get behind if you don't like them at first, and even if you do like them, it's hard to really love them.  
Story: 8/10 
What isn't hard to get behind is the main motive for Tanjiro's journey. I won't write up a synopsis since you can scroll up and see that yourself, but basically it is very easy to enjoy the story of Tanjiro. It isn't anything groundbreaking, and the way the story develops is incredibly generic. As many others have said, this is a generic shonen trimmed of fat (fillers, fanservice, etc.). It does a generic shonen story very well, but the main thing is that it still is generic at the end of the day. Within the scope of the first season, it will hook you with its basic premise and that hook should last for the whole season.  
Overall: 8/10  
As someone who is more interested in character development and story, I am especially critical of how generic Demon Slayer can be, as well as how weak the characters are the longer the story progresses. However, absolutely nothing can take away from how amazing Ufotable has made this anime out to be. I sincerely believe if OPM Season 2 and this show swapped studios, my score for this anime would be 5/10, 6/10 at best. It's just that amazing as an animation. I would not recommend the manga if the only reason you like this so much is because of the art and animation, as I myself was incredibly bored and disappointed by the manga. This however, I like this.",8,Shukle

                I’m of the opinion that 2019 was a particularly dismal year for anime. Sure, I haven’t seen all the hugely praised stuff yet, so it’s possible I’ll warm up to the year as a whole once I get a fuller picture of it. But from what I’ve experienced thus far, it’s been really miserable. Disappointment after disappointment, promising show after promising show failing to live up to its potential, and even lots of the 2019 anime everyone fell in love with really didn’t click with me. Fire Fore wasted oodles of talent on some of the worst writing and directing I’ve seen in a long
                  time. Dororo was pretty great, but also uneven as hell from start to finish. Dr. Stone won everyone else’s hearts but I couldn’t ignore the obvious flaws in its presentation, and honestly, I think my opinion on it has only soured as time’s gone on. One Punch Man’s second season was probably the biggest second-season downgrade since Psycho-Pass, and then Psycho-Pass one-upped it right back with its worst installment yet. Not to mention the conversation and marketing hype that made a smash hit out of Shield Hero, one of the most viscerally unpleasant, harmfully selfish occurrences I’ve seen befall this community. Even the still-reliable My Hero Academia feels like it’s downgraded substantially after its masterpiece of a third season. And, of course, there was the utter tragedy that befell Stars Align, a potential masterpiece that could have truly placed a new landmark for anime, crippled by corporate bullshit and forced to air only half-finished. You couldn’t get more existentially depressing if you tried, especially after the utter triumph of a year that was anime in 2018.
So in a way, Demon Slayer letting me down too makes a very sad kind of sense. The biggest breakout hit of anime in 2019, a massively popular show with everyone’s well-wishes and the efforts of an absurdly talented studio behind it, a shonen smash that’s promising to become just as much a mainstay of the popular conception of anime as MHA in the modern era, that only just last night went so far as to win Anime of the Year at the Crunchyroll awards? Of course it was never gonna live up to the hype. Of course it would fall short of truly being special time and time again, stumbling over its own two feet every time it looked like it was actually gonna pull through. I’ve wondered in the past if I’m turning into an anime hipster, but man, I’ve never felt as disillusioned with the state of the community at large than I have with Demon Slayer. I can only hope this feeling doesn’t last, because I don’t want to ever stop loving what this incredible medium is capable of.
To be clear, I wouldn’t go so far as to call Demon Slayer a bad show. Far from it, in fact; the only reason it’s able to be such a crushing disappointment is that you can easily see all the ways it comes so damn close to working. The action is consistently kickass, with killer kinetic camerawork and eye-poppingly gorgeous stylistic effects that make each clash of steel and blood feel like a painting in motion. Plus, the extra visceral kick from the body horror of the demons themselves can be giddily nasty, loading each fight with a real sense of tension and menace. Ufotable’s crack team of animators keeps the production consistent all the way through, with few dips in quality to speak of. And at its core, the story of Tanjirou’s incredible empathy against the forces of darkness is really fucking solid. There’s genuine gravitas to his journey, powerful emotion behind his determination to never give up on reaching out and believing in the best of everyone, no matter how painful it gets or how difficult it is to believe in. Sure, the mechanics of the story are fairly boilerplate shonen- A kid in early-20th-century Japan has his family slaughtered by a demon and trains to become a demon slayer to fine a cure for his now-demonified sister- but as shows like Blue Exorcist and My Hero Academia have proven time and time again, a well-worn formula done well can still delight and amaze you no matter how many times you see it. There are all the making of a classic in Demon Slayer, all the potential to be something truly special that would earn its astounding popularity a million times over.
But as much as I want to love this show, as many of its pieces speak to me, it just doesn’t hold together with the polish it needs. As beautiful as the action is, the disconnect between Ufotable’s photorealistic backgrounds and the hyperstylized characters and effects never truly goes away. The moment-to-moment pacing can be awkward and stilted, making the already-unnatural dialogue feel even less genuine. There’s no marriage between its light and darkness, no moment where the over-the-top attempts at comedy, snarling villains, and pop-art sensibilities exist in the same world as the sorrow of Tanjirou’s empathy and the sadness he fights to overcome. As a result, you’re constantly getting tonal whiplash, thrown between moments of genuine pathos and attempts at gags so poorly integrated it feels like they take place in an entirely different show. Every scene is full of a million little distractions that add up and cripple your ability to truly immerse yourself in this world, and the writing on its own just isn’t strong enough to cover for that deficiency. And when it sucks, it really fucking sucks. I still can’t get Zenitsu’s mind-numbing screeches out of my head no matter how hard I try. And all that wonderful emotional work and haunting spectacle can only crash up against this impenetrable wall of imperfection, trying so hard to break through but never having enough power behind its punches to truly do so.
Demon Slayer isn’t a bad show. Compared to some of the worst shows of 2019, it might as well be a masterpiece. But it’s perfectly indicative of what a sorrowful dead zone for anime 2019 was, a mediocre attempt at greatness that just can’t pull together no matter how hard it tries. Thankfully, it ends strong enough to give me hope for the franchise’s future: maybe there’s still a chance for it all to matter in the end. Maybe as we leave 2019 behind and step into the already-lightyears-better 2020, this show can finally come into its own and become what it always had the potential to be. Frankly, far stranger things have happened in the anime world, and I wouldn’t be surprised if I end up genuinely liking Demon Slayer as a whole when all is said and done. For now, though, its first season remains a frustrating, tentative, almost-remarkable experience that leaves me eternally sad at what might have been.",5,AnimeBW

                This will be a spoiler free review.
I was pretty late to the bandwagon with this one, but I'm glad I finally sat down and watched it.
I almost gave this show a 10, but I stopped and seriously thought about it. I questioned why I thought it didn't deserve a 10. I had already written this review, but didn't feel right with the rating.
All my complaints were minor, such as one character being the definition of annoying (but gets more likable), or sometimes the pacing gets slightly too fast. 
Everything about this show was done with care and quality. The artstyle is unique and striking, every
                  setting is incredibly atmospheric, the characters are all likable and have depth, the writing can seamlessly go from serious to comedic, the writing always has some underlying message to convey, and the world is fleshed out and alive.
But I think the reason I can't give it a 10 is I don't consider it a masterpiece. I think it's getting close, but it doesn't give me the mentality of ""I couldn't make some aspects better."" 
Because that's what a 10 is - it's unable to be improved on.
Demon Slayer can be improved in some areas, most notably the simplicity of the story. Not that simplicity is bad, but it lessens the impression it leaves on you.",9,Sargossa

                Kimetsu-no yaiba also known as demon slayer is one of the most overhyped new gens by far. Everyone talks about it but does god-tier animation carry ""demon slayer""? Well yes but actually no. The story was about a boy named Tanjiro who came back from selling wood to then realizing that his family had been slaughtered by demons. He has a sister who was named nezuko who was possessed by a demon but thankfully managed to survive. Now he fights demons to protect everyone. He then meets people like zenitsu and inosuke. They all start to fight demons and stop muzan, a demon. The storyline
                  was pretty basic compared to vinland saga, dr.stone and the promised neverland.

                I enjoyed this anime quite a bit.
Loved the story and art, although the story was a little plain in the beginning and took me a while to get through but after about episode 4 I couldn't stop watching and had to finish it before I fell asleep. I liked the Tanjiro, you could tell the improvement and resolve through the show and how he grew as a demon slayer. Inosuke was my favorite part being really funny at times and adding a lighter air at times. Zenitsu had to be my least favorite though, he was really whiny and didn't bring much to the table

                It's pretty rare that an anime comes along with such good art and animation that gives people like me an eye-gasm.
I love good art, i sketch alot of anime/manga characters in most of my (%100 of my time right now) free time so i really get excited when the animation in anime is great, but great would be an understatement for the incredible fight scenes in Kimetsu no Yaiba, you can't explain it to people, you'll have to see it for yourself.
The story in this anime is solid, and doesn't really feel sluggish or slow at all.
The characters are pretty lovable and while some might
                  seem annoying at the start, you get used to them and like them over time.
""Over time""... No, actually, you'll probably binge the entire thing in about 2 days (1 if you're a complete maniac) since the episodes feel like they last 5 minutes. Must have been pretty annoying to see the red flowers and wait a week before another episode comes out. Good thing i watched this after the broadcast ended.

                The series seems quite slow.
The side-characters are more likeable than the main character.
I mean, each episode you're just hoping for it to be about Zenitsu instead, this series could be way better if it was from his perspective.
It could also focus on Inosuke.
But instead we get Tanjirou of the ""terrible dull generic mc"".
The story itself seems alright, its nothing special, you could probably just watch an isekai for the same experience.

--THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN ANIME SPOILERS--
Demon Slayer tackles a story about our male lead, which is around 15-16 years old, towards his journey to avenging and finding a cure for his little sister, that turned into a demon. The thing about this is, the terrible portrayal of our male lead, the fast growth and the system itself.
First of all, our male lead is seen as happy-go-lucky. Of course, it isn't anything bad, but as a 15-16 year old that has witnessed deaths,
                  the way Tanjirou reacts shouldn't be the way he is reacting as a 15-16 year old. Kimetsu no Yaiba uses 'I have witnessed hell' as an excuse for this, and I honestly don't like that. I could go on and on about what's wrong with Tanjirou's mentality, but I'll cut it short here.
Second, I seem to have a lot of problems with our male lead. I do not dislike him, but the way they portrayed him and the pacing of his growth is insane (in a bad way). Tanjirou grew too fast, is a straightforward way to say it. 
Last but not the least, the system is messed up. Hashiras are around the age of 13-20, with only 2 being over 20. Which means that they are recruiting 14 year olds, hear me out, 14 YEAR OLDS to fight demons? Nah ah, way too messed up.

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is so good it kinda reviews itself, if that makes sense. In all honesty, if there's an annual award for 'best anime', if Kimetsu no Yaiba: Demon Slayer doesn't get said award, I'll be shocked! Honestly, I can easily compare it to the likes of other Masterpieces such as Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood. It's serious that damn good.
Story: 10 - Wanting to turn your sister back into a human after she was demonised isn't exactly original, but the journey the MC takes to achieve this is simply outstanding. It's incredible how much emotion is poured into each scene, and I personally found
                  myself either filled with laughter, adrenaline, or tears constantly watching this show.
Art: 10 - Easily some of the best artwork and animation I've ever witnessed in anime, Demon Slayer is top-tier for sure. The attention to detail in backgrounds and fight scenes is simply magnificent.
Sound: 10 - The opening and ending themes are awesome and I find myself never skipping either. It's easy to get emotional just listening to them when you think about everything that is happening in the series. The OST is some of the best music I've listened to in anime as well.
Characters: 10 - Characters are always what get my attention the most when it comes to anime. Kimetsu no Yaiba: Demon Slayer has an awesome cast of characters all with their own unique personalities and quirks that make them constantly enjoyable to watch.
Enjoyment: 10 - Every episode has an impact on the story or characters, and thank god there's 26 of them. If this was a 12 episode anime it just wouldn't be enough. Not a lot of the anime these days has been able to affect me emotionally like Kimetsu no Yaiba: Demon Slayer has.

                This is one of those anime that I watched due to the hype and lemme tell you it did not live up to it! There were many parts of the story that were just absurd--- like demons who have been beheaded being able to talk even though they have been severed from their own lungs. Also, there are twins--- one with white hair and one with black hair. Later in the story they reappear and both have white hair! Did the animators forget?!!!! Major cinema failure.

SHAMONE HEE HEE
さて, Kimetsu no Yaiba is totally EPIC. This was one of the first animes I watched and boy am I glad it was. This is a personal favorite of mine and for good reason so listen up because this is an anime you CANNOT miss.
So let's open up with the positives first. The story is really cool. It's pretty nuanced and, while it gives a me a few too many Tokyo Ghoul vibes, it's still really creative on a lot of different levels. The art is by far THE BEST, yep, you heard it here folks, THE BEST
                  of any anime I have ever watched. We'll have to see if Shingeki no Kyojin 4 manages to top it but something tells me that Kimetsu no Yaiba isn't going to be surpassed for a loooooong time. Everything from the character design to the textures to the incredible fight scenes is amazing. UFOtable really went all out with this one and it totally pays off. The soundtrack is also awesome which is cool. I really like Tanjirou's and Nezuko's characters and their dynamic. They are the best brother-sister team of any anime I have seen and I am (and probably always will be) rooting for them on their quest. Michael Jackson is also a fantastic villain. I am a bit sad that we didn't get any renditions of Smooth Criminal or Thriller though. PETITION FOR UFOTABLE TO BUY THE RIGHTS TO MJ'S MUSIC FOR SEASON 2.
However, it goes without saying that Kimetsu no Yaiba has some... ISSUES... Pretty much everything after the great episode 19 is a snoozefest. They fail to make the emotional moments impactful and the training arc... it just doesn't work y'know? But my biggest problem is without a doubt ZENITSU AND INOSUKE. These are two of the most annoying, obnoxious, nonsensical characters in any anime I have seen. Zenitsu gets on my nerves so much. His cowardice is super exaggerated and he feels sorry for himself way too much. Inosuke is too violent and it's not funny or likable. He's so concerned with inducing pain and bloodshed that he loses any common-sense and it really pisses me off. Their voice actors also really get on my nerves (though this is more the fault of the characters themselves and not so much of the voice actors). I mostly blame the mangaka for this but UFOtable really could have done something to make these characters a bit less exhausting. Tanjirou and Nezuko are good enough to keep the score for character at an eight instead of a seven, but UFOtable really dropped the ball on this one.
Overall this anime just barely scrapes by with a nine. I don't know if it really deserves its #31 position, but it's definitely worth watching. I don't want you guys to get the wrong idea. I don't dislike this anime. The opposite in fact. I'm hard on this anime mostly because I love it so much. I'm really hoping that the movie and season 2 are better, but in and of itself this one is really good. I definitely recommend it. Even if you're not a fan of the story and characters it's worth a watch just because of the insane animation. Enjoy it and appreciate the wholsomeness that is Tanjirou and Nezuko.

                Everybody, even the people who try to elevate every aspect of this show, know it's main appeal. So, I will start talking about the visuals as is the main strength of the show.
The ilustration is pretty good, some CGI but nothing too invasive, it has it's own style. People remember the action scenes the most but the style that it has most of the time is actually very cartoony and it looks good for what it is. Of course, the action scenes are outstanding visually. They are incredibly fluid, the illustration is on point and has no quality drops and in general they just give
                  everything anyone could want.
At least in soundtrack and visuals because the writing is not that great.
The series have some high peaks, but generally is not that different from any series. Cliches everywhere, one-note characters, power-ups. It's shonen, basically, a regular shonen.
It tries to have some different aspects but none of them goes too far. The tragic backstory of the antagonists are barely explored and have very little weight, the power system is one of the simplest there could be, the battles are being beaten until you get inspired and beat them instead.
There are even some things that are outright bad. Zenitsu is a one-note character that even when he takes part on some really good scenes is obnoxious and is screaming most of the time. Inosuke is the same minus the obnoxious part and Tanjiro is pretty bland as a main character. (Although not as much as Nezuko).
Strangely, even with all of this, I still recommend it. Is a good entertainment if you can ignore the writing faults and has enough good things to balance out the bad ones if you are not looking for anything spectacular.",6,BasicallyAnybody

                  as I said.It’s none of those ‘misleading hidden gems’.It just leads to it’s way and oh boy ufotable sure knows what they are doing.For the starters we are set to be in a taisho period in Japan in a rather rural side of the country in a period where their is a certain demon outburst.Our protagonist Tanjiro(3) couldn’t be happy like always as one day he finds his whole family massacred by a demon and worse yet his own sister Nezuko has turned into a demon.However nezuko seems to have a certain self control as she can deminish her demonic spirit to almost zero.These sudden terrifying turn of events horrified Tanjiro and he didn’t know what to do.The twist of events continued as he finds himself assisted by the demon slayer community as they have also more or less have gone through days just like Tanjiro.Overwhelmed with the avenge thirst of taking revenge along with finding ways to make Nezuko back to normal Tanjiro chose the path of cruelty because that’s the only possible way he could sort everything out at once.By years of training Tanjiro grew stronger as he always seemed that type of character who can always grow and extend his limits and he starts a brave adventure along with Nezuko always with him (4)Surprisingly he found out Muzan,(5)the demon who killed his family pretty quickly into the story but he had nothing but to sigh how dense the situation of Muzan is as he had a human family himself and can turn anyone into demon just by a claw of his.Meantime he finds Zenitsu and Inosuke(6) who have also beared somewhat same fate.This trio(7)regardless of how different they are seems to get along pretty good.Nevertheless,things started to get intense very quickly as the trio couldn’t help themselves without hashiras(the highest ranked slayers) involving with them.But it seems hashiras and the master himself was interested in them anyways specially regarding to Nezuko issue.From then the story necessarily doesn’t go anywhere as it seemed to focus more on to some hashira backstories and just utter comedy.But impressively in the last ep it goes deep on how big of a threat was Muzan and for the next train arc it maintained the hype and pace(8) quite perfectly.
Now that we’ve had the starters let’s get down to business.I’ll be talking about those points I’ve marked first-
(1) and (2):See how contradictory the points are?While one quote triumphs the intimidating strength over weak or humbleness the other sees it from a totally different perspective as humbleness,humane morals mean much more.That’s exactly why demon slayer isn’t your typical shounen.For the first point we have one hashira saying the same thing you’ll possibly guessed anyways to be the main theme of a action packed series like KnY.But it actually isn’t.It’s the 2nd point of Tanjiro bringing much more to the show.The show continues to cease with these two points as Tanjiro kept showing how good of a MC he is and how the show is different.
(3):Talking about Tanjiro,the 3rd point brings us to himself.I honestly think Tanjiro is a key factor of the show.’Redemption’,’revenge’ yeah sure he has those too but it’s the humane side that makes him apart.Not to mention,the perfect balance of his strength and growing ability makes him different to other typical shounen MCs.Kamado Tanjiro is solely determined to his goal of avenge but still doesn’t lose his humane side for a minute as we see him to have condolences towards demons whom even harmed his sister.Too naive?Yeah sure at times he is but that’s just make things more natural for the characteristics he has.
(4):Wholesomeness.Yes a noun you probably won’t find in typical battle shounens.Nezuko,the sister makes things wholsesome to another level.From holding fingers of his brother helplessly,giving head pats to people imagining as her family to an extraordinary demon who has astonishing ability of holding back from human blood-Kamado Nezuko sure adds some wholesomeness to the show as we experience some of the best Brother-sister bond in anime.
(5):Kibutsuji Muzan,the boss demon as we may call him-has one of the best villain designs in the Battle shounen animes.From inside out that’s how you make a perfectionist villain.As I mentioned before,in the impressive last ep the series showed how much of a threat he is and how versatile his powers are.Adding that,the perfectionist yet the devilish vibes he gives away everytime he gets screen time-Muzan sure made things more intense just like it should be.
(6):Here we have the first issue of the show-Zenitsu and Inousuke,the companions of Tanjiro throughout the journey.’Companions’ sounds fine right?But no.They are not companions.They are actually one of those three characters the show focuses on particularly.The thing with Zenitsu and Inosuke is their laughter or scream-how you may adress these,they are not the problem.That’s are just how they are.These are just characterisation.But the issue starts when the show tries to exaggerate these,when it tries to over saturate these.Like,Zenitsu starts a joke which made you laugh,Inosuke makes some weird sound which made you crack-that’s it.That’s where you should stop.But nope.They seemingly can’t stop laughing and screaming time and time again.These make things worse in two ways-(i)The dark,serious vibe demises yet and yet again which is really a shame because the show hooked a majority of it’s audience because of it’s vibe and aesthetics.(ii)It’s annoying.It’s sometimes is so irritating that I’m sure it made some people drop the show which is really depressing to think that such a well thought,detailed,unfamiliar shounen gets dropped just because of these small things.Last issue for Zenitsu and Inoukse would be I guess the back story of them.The show does spent time showing how they become demon slayers(specially zenitsu) and I guess that’s just enough.The show’s focus wasn’t character development to begin with so I guess it didn’t bothered me that much.
(7):Here is the thing that kind of peddled back the whole 6th point a bit.The trio.Yeah the trio of Tan,Zen,Ino kinda sort things out.Looking at how different of a person they are from each other and considering how varied their thoughts are-somehow the show managed to work them out together pretty well.As they say,”No matter how bad something is,you’ll get used to it over time”-this happened exactly for Zen and Ino.Being in the trio,having ridiculous interactions with one another-we happen to grow some affection towards them over time.Nonetheless let this not distract you,Zen and Ino personally were still annoying at times but somehow the show found a way and time did the rest.
(8):Hype-builiding and story pacing.Demon slayer does that brilliantly.Right from the start,I felt that perfect story pacing of this show along with those cliffhangers(aka hype-building) after every 1/2 episodes.At the end of the day no matter how much details there are,KnY is still a battle shounen of a boy slaying demons you know and for a battle shounen to work out these things are essential.Demon slayer just perfectly does that-not too much or not too less-this show has done these just flamboyantly!
As now I have broke down some key points of the show let’s now talk about the technical stuffs:
Animation and art in KnY is one of the best you’ll ever see in a series.Even the CGI and camera movement blends so well with the soothing animation.One certan episode of the show just left me speechless as I was eyegasmed by how beautifully the scene was made.It’s not just about one single moment or one single episode,the series will continue to impress it’s audience from start to end;not just those fight impacts and powerups,even in simple comedy scene you can see how much effort was put into these as we continue to choke on funny expressions and postures of our characters with having nothing to do but admire how sarcastically the expressions were drawn.The thing is KnY didn’t have to do all these small details,it will naturally bang on with the kind of animation it has but still you can feel the effort put into these in almost every frame.
Music and sounds may not be the strongest side of KnY but it just comes short of that god tier animation stuff.VAs did a noticeable job in this series.I don’t particularly care about VAs but I had to be amused how well they dived into their characters and the situations.You can’t really expect less from such A grade voice actors.Now for the music the OP with that metalic J-pop might not cope with the gore vibe of this show but the ED make things neutral with a rather beautifully soothing song.Moreover,the OSTs are not a point less than sheer quality.Whatever,the scene was KnY had tracks that go along so well throughout the series.But one thing it did,it didn’t changed the OP and ED at all.Even the scenes were unchanged till the end.That really is a miss because the show actually had top notch music but for that fact I think people really didn’t care much about it’s music.
Thus to conclude,
KnY isn’t your typical battle shounen from whatever perspective you look at it.It has that boost to stand out in every aspect.But don’t get it me wrong,Demon Slayer isn’t any masterpiece either.For me this show is really upto the front page of battle shounens but the continuous process of it’s exaggeration,over saturation resulting the show look more polished,solid,hype-creating show targeting a certain audience rather than maintaining it’s vibe of a iconic shounen really backfired for me.
But still just like I mentioned again and again of this show’s standing out-trust me,it really does.As I stated in the beginning,Ufotable sure knew what they are doing.So,even if you’re not generally into shounen stuffs I’ll recommend you to watch this show.It really won’t be you typical shounen even if it appears to be.
That’s it for me.Thank you if you’re still here.It’s my first anime review.Even if it helps by a little I’ll be glad.Do tell me how you felt about this review in the comments.

                The only things Kimetsu no Yaiba highlights are his excellent soundtrack and animation, I can't find anything to criticize about it. The openings and endings are one of the best I've ever heard and served as relief in the middle of some tedious or annoying episodes. 
An anime is rated by a number of factors for me, but judging by the reception of the general public, it seems that the only important thing are good fights, because the story here is terrible and I see only people talking how wonderful it is. If you don't care about the story this anime is yours! 
Let's start
                  by talking about something called impact. The shock that some scenes try to cause you is extremely flawed, several times characters we barely know end up dying shortly after introduced, the problem is... that there's just no way to care. Here I am talking about characters who apparently have strong connection with the main and some enemies. How to feel sensitized? You just played shallow flashback that lasts seconds in front of me so I fell sorry for the characters, it won't work. 
Speaking of flashbacks, they are often used as a lazy solution to motivate the characters with their masters saying that they should not give up. One of the most ridiculous moments in the anime is precisely one of the most beloved fights. After a flashback of his childhood, Tanjiro remembers a skill of his father and manages to execute it without any problem. You expect me to believe that he can remember a move made by his father a long time ago and turn it into a skill so easily? Yes, the fight is great, but it seems that people have forgotten to call coherence. At another point, Nezuko, Tanjiro's sister, manages to use a skill without having received any instructions about it. There's no worry about explaining how she knew what to do too.
Overall, the characters are as shallow as a shell without pearl. 
Tanjiro is kind, determined (like every standard protagonist) and wants to protect his sister, Inosuke gets angry very easy and Zenitsu is very fearful. There is almost no development in them, except for the fact that they get stronger because of training. When I say almost no development, it's practically nothing. After the introduction of Zenitsu the anime receives a high dose of humor that should be funny, but ends up being annoying and unnecessary, in addition to excessive. Zenitsu also contributes by being one of the most annoying characters, he screams and cries most of the time. Several times the humor is introduced in the middle of the fight, breaking the rhythm by something useless. The fact is that much of the work is empty, so this humor helps in filling. There are few situations in which the three dialogue about something that makes their personalities deeper, most dialogues want to reinforce humor or their determination, because they want to get stronger and that's it.
It was hard to get past the first 7 episodes, I managed to entertain myself a little after that, not enough to consider this a good anime, I don't see it as something bad either, because I would watch a new season.
Imagine if this anime had a well-told story, what a 10 could be...",5,Grunheidt19
38000,"
                This show is a seasonal shonen. It is completely generic in its characters, overarching story, and the beats of the fights. So why am I giving it a high score? 
Well, for starters, it's incredibly well made with tasteful CGI that only enhances where it's used. The art is fantastic, and the animation is fluid with the action scenes being easy to follow. I don't think I can overstate how good it feels to see and hear the swords swing or the characters run and jump.
The characters themselves are simple tropes; Tanjiro is a good guy and a hard worker who seeks revenge as a
                  result of tragedy and wants to help his sister. Pig mask dude is a sole survivor who somehow got really strong. Zenitsu is an insecure wimp who has incredible power when he has no choice but to turn and fight. I expect that they'll learn to team up better, and I'm sure they'll get more depth, but they're still relatively cookie cutter. 
Everything plot-wise is predictable, but at least there are no ass-pulls to win fights; rules are generally well established. Praise also has to be given for not dragging out any of the arcs. It goes heavy on exposition despite clearly showing things, but this can be forgiven.
This show is just really fun to watch. It doesn't say anything profound, but it is a great time.",8,billpika

                [this review contains spoilers. each section (story, art, character, enjoyment, overall) will be marked with the severity of spoilers, with no mark meaning it contains no spoilers. additionally, each section will contain a spoiler-free tldr that summarizes what im trying to say into one or two points.]
kimetsu no yaiba (kny) is either going to be one of your favorite shounen upon completing it or youll think its the most overhyped, mediocre anime youve seen in the past 5 years. i can tell you though that at first i was the former, overtime i gradually became the latter, so this review is probably more honest than
                  most. when i first watched then read kny, i enjoyed it a lot, but after that i started to dislike it more and more when i realized all the things wrong with it.
story: 4 (minor spoilers)
the major plot of kny is that everyone lives in a world with demons. demons are weak to sunlight. and can only be killed from either that or from being their heads cut off. tanjirou, our main character, returns to his home to find his family has been slaughtered by a demon, except for his sister, nezuko, who has turned into one. normally, all demons are aggressive, but for some reason, nezuko shows no hostility. over the course of the series, tanjirou gets strong so that he can confront the lord of all demons, muzan, to find a way to turn his sister back from demon to human. 4 doesnt mean its necessarily bad, but on myanimelist, a 4 is marked as decent, and thats exactly what it is. it has its interesting moments, but it overall feels rather generic for the most part.
[tldr: story is generic, but not necessarily bad]
art: 10
kny is beautifully animated, and its especially impressive given the rather inconsistent nature of the mangas art. all the scenes look amazing, whether its a fight scene or a gag scene, and its obvious that the animators put in a ton of work to make this show look as incredible as it does.
[tldr: fire]
[i dont have a category on sound cause i dont really remember what its like but the opening is good if that means anything i guess]
characters: 4 (minor spoilers, with one major spoiler (characters involved unnamed, will be tagged as major spoiler)
i dont really like a lot of the characters in kny. i find tanjirou to be just a boring main character who has had multiple moments of insane plot armor, and id even go as far to say it bears a likeness to the plot armor of kirito from sword art online. other major characters like zenitsu i simply found annoying. and i didnt really like how nezuko had no purpose for the majority of the show/manga outside of being tanjirous motivation to confront muzan. inosuke is funny though i enjoy him. additionally, though muzan does seem a pretty cool villain at first, he doesnt really get much time in the anime, (only adapts first 50 or so out of the 200 or so chapters) and in the manga i found i thought he was a bit of a letdown. the only characters i really like are some of the hashiras and a few demons, specifically shinobu, rengoku, (hashira) and douma (demon), but all of these characters have their major parts outside of season one, with rengokus being animated in the mugen train movie and shinobu and doumas being in the later portions of the manga. MAJOR-ISH (vague) SPOILER:
there also happens to be a technique used time and time again where before or after a character dies, the author takes a few chapters to lay out their backstory, in an attempt to make you pity them. later in the manga, you can tell when a character will die because their entire backstory will happen at a critical moment in battle. 
the major spoiler^
to continue, characters like tanjiro and zenitsu certainly had cool moments despite by dislike for them, but theyre not nearly enough to outweigh that dislike.
[tdlr: dislike most main characters, majority of the characters i like are featured mostly in manga]
enjoyment: 5
there were definitely parts of kny that i enjoyed. i thought it was funny at times, i liked a few characters, and some action scenes were sick as hell. despite this, there just happen to be such poor writing in parts that it dampens ones enjoyment, especially when it comes to the manga. after finishing kny, i found there were a lot of parts about it i just plain disliked, especially the characters and story, which are absolutely massive to an anime/mangas enjoyment factor. as mentioned earlier, though, i did enjoy it while i watched/read it. the enjoyment is rather difficult to rate, because though i did indeed enjoy a fair amount of it, i also never want to even consider rereading this until ive become an elder.
[tldr: difficult to rate, kinda good but things like poor characters and writing take away a whole fucking lot]
overall: 5
i think kny is probably a risk worth taking. if you like it, youll come out with a great new anime and manga, and if you dont, youll come out with a newfound dislike for people praising it and a tendency to call it ki-mid-tsu no yaiba (alternatively de-mid slayer). i think a decent amount of disappointment with many is the fact that while it was airing, kny was overhyped to no end, which is most likely still a problem that will persist with people who are just starting to get into it. id say if youre planning to get into kny, come in with an open mind with both the idea of it being potentially either something that is very good an enjoyable or something thats extremely overrated.

                This is what I call a masterpiece.
Really, I'm in love. The art and animation is just amazing. The story and characters are amazing. The soundtracks are amazing. Everything about the anime is amazing. The strong bond between Tanjirou and Nezuko really touches me and the emotional scenes hit me every time I watch them.
This is definitely an anime that will make it to the next ""Big Three"", no doubt about that. If you want an anime that is pure art, watch Kimetsu no Yaiba. I also recommend it to people when they want to start watching anime, since it's such a gem.

                Starts out slow but, oh boy the season pick up pace and towards the end its adrenaline rush. Can't wait for the season 2. And the Animation is fantastic too. Worth giving it a chance.
I watched most of the story parts at 1.5 speed, but the fights are one of the best in animes. The dialogues during fights are also interesting. Sure sometimes it unnecessarily dwells into the past of some minor villains to get us to connect more but that not more that 5 mins and is ok.

                I'll be honest, when I first heard from friends about this anime, something about it sounded overhyped. I've seen enough cases of a shonen anime being incredibly hyped and popular only to get mediocre results, and I initially thought that this is not going to be much different.
I have never been happier to be wrong. The popularity, in this case, is completely justified, and the anime is not quite overrated!
STORY:
Well, relatively speaking, it's the weakest aspect out of the five in this one. It is still very good, though, and I mean VERY good.
There's one big downside though - Plot armor. It's everywhere, you can't
                  ignore it. Unlike many other anime out there it seems to actually *make sense* and correlate with the story so in some cases I did decide to give it a pass, but some others are rather disappointing and feel like they should have been introduced in a different way.
ART:
I wish I could give an 11. I've seen some anime with fantastic animation, but my god, the art here is STUNNING. It's brilliantly made, 2.5D elements are integrated very well, the sakuga is almost unique to this one and the style is easy to grasp, but the battle scenes, good lord, especially the one in the climactic moment somewhere in the 2nd half of the season in an episode number I won't specify. What a fantastic sequence, what a masterpiece, what an outstanding work of art.
Everything art-related in this anime is not only pure eye candy, it actually works to affect your feelings of a scene.
SOUND:
The soundtrack, the voice acting (ZENITSU GODDAMMIT), the BGMs, it fits so well in the staging that nearly everything I said about the art category applies here as well. Zero complaints, perfect.
CHARACTER:
Finally I can see what I felt was missing in so many other anime I reviewed here. The best character balance and development I've seen in shonen. I'll cover a couple of the main characters but really generally to avoid spoiling as much as possible (maybe very minor ones in the Nezuko part but they're also for the first few episodes), and also not all of them to prevent giving away the sequence of the anime:
Tanjiro is a fantastic protagonist. I think the humorous part of him was introduced a little too late but it's worth the wait. At first I thought he's a little bit of a Gary Sue, especially with the plot armor, but this image does break when you see several scenes where he actually struggles and develops.
Nezuko is one of the most interesting deuteragonists I've seen in anime, maybe even at all. She is a great mix of simplicity and complexity, openness and mystery. She's the driving force behind the story, and even though her screentime is very limited as a deuteragonist, her impact is huge. The story decision to let Tanjiro carry her on his back the whole time is an amazing decision - you don't see Nezuko, but you're always reminded she's there, she matters, and it's all for her.
Zenitsu and Inosuke are an amazing comedic relief and they bring a great spice to the show. They are arguably the most distinct characters you can put in the same boat and yet they complete each other experience-wise and make the show much more enjoyable.
Lastly (even though I left out so many amazing characters) - the villains.
Finally, a shonen with villains who have depths. So many villains in this anime (except for the super-ultra-mega-bad guy, and even that one has potential) are so well-written and well-executed, deep, and interesting.
Absolutely great experience!!
ENJOYMENT:
Perfect. Mystery, action, thrill, comedy, drama, shifts between fast and slow pace, this anime is a rollercoaster that was amazingly enjoyable to ride.
In conclusion: One of the finest shonen I watched. Really can't wait for more seasons. Glad I went against my initial instincts and gave it a try :)",9,RoyalSeraph

                !Mild Spoilers for up to episode 20!
Honestly, I was looking forward to watching this. The Hype alone was crazy and Ufotable doesn't usually disappoint but there is a first time for everything I guess.
Kimetsu no Yaiba's Story is pretty much as generic as it gets: Demons terrorise and eat humans, demon slayers got to fight the demons. After main character Tanjirou's family gets killed and his sister turned into a demon he goes off to find a cure and get revenge.
Now this Synopsis should probably come with a Spoiler warning because unfortunately  there isn't much more actual Story to be had here. It's a
                  basic ""monster of the week"" type show, dealing with a new demon every few episodes. Now for a Shounen like this a generic Story is normally not much of a problem. The fights and the characters should be able to carry the show for the most part.
Which leads us to the worst part about this show, which is without a doubt the characters.
Tanjirou is about as generic as protagonists come. All of his traits can be easily explained by just stating that he is a shonen protagonist, nothing more, nothing less. He's loyal, friendly, sometimes a bit naive and stubborn. I never thought that I would say this but if you swapped out our main character here for Ichigo Kurosaki from Bleach, it would not make a single difference. On second thought Ichigo is probably more interesting. Tanjirou can't even score with his fighting skills since every single thing he learns someone just tells him to do. Almost every time he needs to get stronger some exchangeable side-character comes along and tells him what to do, he gets a training montage and done.
Except once, in episode 19, when Tanjirou faces a particularly strong demon who's about to defeat him. But don't get your hopes up because what's coming next is a wonderful example of a deus ex machina at the hands of a character we have never even seen before. 
And although it is sad to say, Tanjirou is not even that bad compared to who he's paired with. Nezuko, the little sister who got turned into a demon, doesn't even have a character. The only trait she has is that she likes Tanjiro and wants to protect him. And her role of walking (or carried) plot device get's even worse when you consider that barely any plot is happening.
Inouske is an idiot who likes fighting. End of character. Imagine Kenpachi Zaraki (again from Bleach) but a lot worse.
And thus we have arrived at the worst of all: Zenitsu is legitimately one of the worst characters I have ever had the misfortune to witness. He is weak, a coward, attaches himself to every female he sees and overall just takes up way to much screentime. He could maybe have been actually good at fighting or at least try to face his fears even if he gets beaten but no, in the next case of deus ex machina he suddenly gets really good at fighting when he sleeps. So even the only redeeming feature this show has (which is of course the action) does absolutely nothing for him.
The antagonists in general are not much better and also make basically no impact on the story. They are completely forgotten as soon as the next one comes around. Which brings me to one of the worst storytelling choices anyone has ever made. Every time Tanjro defeats a demon you get their backstory in excruciatingly long flashbacks. Pro writing tip: If a character is dead, an thus does not have any impact on the story then it is completely pointless to try to expand that character. Additionally it makes for about 30 minutes of runtime that can be skipped without consequences (looking at you episode 20).
The rest of the cast are more shonen stereotypes without any actual personality. The could theoretically be developed more in later seasons but based on what I have seen here I won't get my hopes up.
The last major point that has to be addressed is of course the action. Almost any amount of bad characters and story can still be enjoyable if the action is good and when Kimetsu no Yaiba tries it looks really good. Ufotable once again created some stunning visuals. But there is one thing that really dampens my excitement. The stunning visuals i mentioned are spread really thin. For every cool action scene you have at least 2 or 3 episodes of boring scenes of Tanjirou or who ever is fighting at the moment just running around to stall the momentum. It felt at times like they were really struggling to reach the 20 min mark on certain episodes. And the saddest part is that there is clear evidence that Ufotable can do so much better. Now I may be a bit biased here because I am a big fan, but compare Kimetsu no Yaiba to Fate/Stay Night UBW, a show that came out 5 years earlier. UBW kept a pretty recognisable formula of action episode followed by slice of life episode followed by action episode and so on. It may be formulaic but at least the action was spectacular every single second it was on screen.
The one thought that comes to me when I think of Kimetsu no Yaiba now (and I never thought I would say something like this) is that this show feels a lot like Bleach, but somehow worse. Now that might be an unfair comparison (I haven't seen Bleach in a while) but for now it stands. It did not live up to the hype by a long shot.",3,Lyreon

                I tried reading the manga, but it was so boring to me that I stopped at chapter 12.
But, oh, God, what a beautiful adaptation this is!
The art and animation are absolutely gorgeous. 10/10 for both of them. Studio ufotable did a great job.
The premise of the story might seem cliche, but the way that is executed is interesting. I love the fact that the training arc was just one episode which contained 2 years. Now, this was realistic.
The soundtrack and the sound effects are on point.
I love Tanjiro as a protagonist. He is simple, he does not play around with words and he takes action,
                  he loves his sister and wants to help her after he lost everything. Nezuko is cute and funny, it shows that she is a strong female character for the fact that she is able to control herself and not eat people.
Also, I love the opening.",10,DarkDiamond16

                Honestly when this series blew up lat year I thought it would be one of the best current shonen. Like maybe top 6. But then I watched the anime like a week ago and i was really diappointed. The charcters are subpar, barley average. It has the cliche, ""pure"" protagonist with a pervert chracter, over the top charcater, and then you got the big dog ""heroes"" that are actually so hypocritical. When a charcter dies in this show, they try to make it sad but how can you feel anything when you litteraly only met this charcter a few chapters ago. Unlike in shows like
                  one piece or fmab where the charcaters are developed over time where in this show, when they die then we get a pointless backstory when nobody cares. The art in this anime is good but thats only because of the studio who polished it. In the manga it is complete garbage. The animation is greta but definetly does not deserve best animation of the decade. I think people fergot about opm s1 and hxh and others. At best i would give it a seven.",7,lajz

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is no doubt one of my favorite animes. When I first heard this anime, I was very much doubting this anime because it was so over-hyped but no, there's clearly a good reason why. The characters, the art, and the story are top-notch.
The story is easy to follow and there's a good mix of horror and action, however, some parts of the story could be slow at times. The main characters were, for the most part, loveable and the demons Tanjiro encounters were well-developed. The art, especially for episode 19, is one of the best-animated episodes, the way they executed the whole
                  episode was absolutely amazing. Overall, Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of the best action-filled anime, by far one of the best animes I've seen.",10,yakotopom

                Oh boy, this is going to stir up some controversy isn’t it?
Every now and then, you’d get an anime that blows up like a stick of dynamite in this community. The type of series that entices viewers based on the first episode alone, instilling hopeful expectations in them that the show would turn out to be a smash hit that destroys records and takes its place as one of the modern classics of the medium. And despite what a lot of naysayers are piping up about, no these are not the kinds of anime that will be forgotten by the community once another manages to
                  take its place as the new hypetrain. Very rarely does that even happen – Erased doesn’t count because its last few episodes left a bad mark on people’s memories.
In 2011, it was Steins Gate and Madoka Magica; in 2012, it was Fate Zero and Psycho Pass; in 2013, it was Attack on Titan… well, you get the point. This year – other than the third season of some random show, where a couple of wannabee, grappling hook wielding soldiers (or as I like to call them: Spidermen) fight off against colossal, naked giants that absolutely no one is for sure talking about – its most certainly been Demon Slayer, or Kimetsu no Yaiba if you speak Weeblish. If you haven’t kept up with the community these days (and I so hope that is the case given its current state in a more civilized era), this show has been taking it by storm. And it’s not challenging to see why; it’s got a likable shonen protagonist with a concrete motivation other than just wanting to become the best, a massive sprawling story with its own set of lore, a unique setting in early 1900s Japan (allowing for the Kabaneri approach where samurai can now wield advanced weaponry), some gruesome violence to satisfy the taste palates of gorehounds everywhere, and some of the most cutting-edge animation and soundtracks to be found in the industry.
So, why don’t I like it then?
It might be odd to have a rather critical diatribe on a recently aired series that is almost universally adored, be the first post somebody might stumble across on this blog. But, as I’ve also said in the past, honesty is key when it comes to one’s writing. And, in my case, while I can appreciate a vast number of elements in this anime alone, there are ten times more that irritate me at every chance it gets. Imagine first trying out liquor; sure, everybody romanticizes it to the point they’d actively try to sneak some into your glass of water, but the moment the contents of it reach the tip of your tongue, you’re going to recoil in disgust. That’s certainly what it felt when I tried red wine for the first time. I can remember feeling the bitter, searing liquid immolate the back of my throat on graduation as I watched all my peers having a ball with their choice of booze. This is what it was like for me to watch Demon Slayer.
Tonal dissonance is a term many film connoisseurs like to use, especially when discussing anime. I mean, it kind of makes sense given that a lot of what the medium has to offer is filled to the brim with comedy interspersed with scenes of extreme violence and tragedy in the wrong places at the wrong time. Imagine watching The Godfather and halfway through for no apparent reason, Don Corleone comes out of a closet wearing a clown outfit and honking a horn. It feels exactly like that. Demon Slayer is littered with scenes of immature comedy followed by brutal death scenes that wouldn’t look out of place in a hard-R-rated exploitation flick. It follows the Hellsing Ultimate approach, and it feels very distracting. The first episode handled it best, having almost zero comedy as the main character comes home to find his entire family – save for one – slaughtered by demonic beings. The tone was set perfectly from the beginning of the episode to the very end, and I fully felt immersed in the narrative to want to give it a try. However, it gets worse in later episodes where characters can literally have their entire bodies ripped completely in half or are tragically murdered right out of the blue and in the next somebody complains about not being good with girls in a humorous fashion. This might seem hypocritical of me given that one of my personal favorites include a rather “unknown” series called Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, which does the exact same thing. Yes, FMA does have a similar problem to Demon Slayer, but where it excels at is that its comedy is funny and is used appropriately throughout the series. In Demon Slayer, it often tends to be rather childish than hilarious. It feels like something out of Teen Titans Go, where only a small child would be driven to laughter by it (this is rather subjective, so there’s no need to turn into a bunch of keyboard warriors at this statement). And that brings me to my next point.
The tone the show presents doesn’t fit the story it’s trying to tell. For a show with a lot of depressing moments, bloodshed, and the lack of plot armor for both combatants and innocents alike, Demon Slayer still feels like a show aimed at a younger teen demographic. It dabbles in simple shonen messages such as the power of love and friendship, making it come across as an adventurous and whimsical Saturday morning cartoon than a gory action series where all bets are off. It’s as if somebody just read Berserk and wanted to turn it into a PG-rated show but keep all the violence and brutality fully intact. Sure, all the above can be said about Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, but the core presentation of that show’s themes and messages comes across as being rather mature. FMA at its core is a relatively complex and thematically dense series that explores a lot of complicated and hard-to-digest ideas such as the corruption of power, the psychological impact of war, authoritative rule, what it means to be human, religion, immortality, etc. Demon Slayer, on the other hand, is a series where the power of love and friendship nets characters an instant powerup. This is only made worse by the inclusion of the “Taisho Secret” segments at the end of each episode. These are homages to the lighthearted end-of-episode skits that are common in shonen anime, particularly ones airing during the early 2000s. Think the “Shinigami Illustrated color-book” stories at the end of most Bleach episodes. In these segments, two characters from the show will leap out from the background of a page from the Demon Slayer manga, as they attempt to comment about their thoughts on the episode and share a certain secret about one of the characters that isn’t revealed in the actual episode. It’s childish, feels like something out of Sesame Street (which makes it oddly jarring if taken place after an episode where somebody suffers an excruciatingly gruesome fate), and I often just skip them entirely because all their supposed “secrets” are just worthless to the overall plot. I don’t need to know what Nezuko’s favorite breakfast routine is, save that shit for the OVAs.
And speaking of childish, the characters only exist to reinforce this. Tanjiro is intelligent, determined, and thoughtful; characteristics that are pretty much guaranteed to classify your shonen protagonist as likable and worth rooting for. But in hindsight, he’s also nothing more than a boy scout in many ways, just always wanting to do good and not having to come to terms with any moral dilemmas. His sister Nezuko isn’t any better. Her main role in the story is to act as a plot device to get the main character determined to achieve his goal of curing her of her demonic powers and she isn’t very useful outside of some deus ex machina moments. Plus, just deal with it guys, she’s just waifu material so people can make memes about wanting to protect her. Inosuke brings some added zaniness to the cast but isn’t well utilized aside from just bragging about battle and getting into all sorts of trouble. There’s also that one characteristic about him where he’s a handsome hunk underneath that pig mask. The worst by far has to be Zenitsu. This character is what Jar Jar Binks is to the Star Wars prequels – cowardly, annoying, tone-deaf and otherwise creepy due to his obsessive attractiveness to Nezuko. Even in moments where he is useful to the cast, its mainly only because of a deus ex machina that somehow causes his body to become possessed. He never even shows signs of improvement in terms of characterization and stays static throughout.
But, despite my criticisms, I do recommend this title to fans of the alleged shonen genre. As a battle shonen, it’s one of the most well-animated, maybe even the best of its kind. Ufotable brings their A-game to this production, making good work of their frenetic 3D camera techniques and stellar visual effects to add dynamism and fluidity to every fight sequence. There’s so much style to every fight that it’s impossible not to enjoy watching the visuals collide with one another. Even the CGI here is highly competent, putting it almost at Pixar levels. Never in a tv anime has there been such unprecedented combination of both 2D and 3D animation. The music is grandiose and epic in scale, intensifying at the right pivotal points throughout the duration of the series. One should look no further than episode 19, an episode so wildly praised by not only the community, but also non-anime watchers alike that it even ended up trending in the top 20s on Twitter. It’s a visual and audio feast for the eyes; the animators at Ufotable really care a lot about this project. It isn’t just something to rake in more sales for the manga, but an adaptation made with passion and love.
I also really like the villains in this show. Muzan may look like some wannabee Michael Jackson fan given his fancy attire, but damn, I’d be lying if I said he wasn’t intimidating. He’s like a chameleon, able to blend himself into the crowd and even fake out others into thinking he’s just some ordinary human. It just allows him to strike at every moment he’s got the chance. And his kills are just nasty. The show really does a magnificent job at painting him as this maniacal, devious fellow who has established a chain of command amongst the other demons. Not bad for what is supposed to be the final boss. The other villains aren’t any worse. The good thing about the series is how the demons aren’t even evil; they’re just people trying to struggle against the corrupted side of themselves and having to give in to it as their inner demon completely takes over their body. It adds a lot of humanity to them rather than just making them out as power-hungry criminals or something, and it really makes you question whether the demon slayer corps are even the good guys for trying to eliminate them, rather than trying to just rid them of the evil that seeps inside their veins. In fact, one of the main elements of the show is how they’re not that different from Nezuko. Most are just kind-hearted individuals who just happened to run into Muzan and his cronies out of bad luck. Granted, the show could do without just flashing their backstory seconds after their demise as a half-assed attempt to get us to care about them, but overall, they’re rather refreshing compared to other shonen baddies.
All in all, this show is like having breakfast at a reputable diner. The meal is tasty, but in many ways isn’t exactly healthy if eaten all the time and the dopamine starts to wear off, especially for more demanding individuals. But, as a ridiculously well-animated battle shonen, it’s a fine watch. It is mid, not trash, but it certainly isn’t thought-provoking, quality entertainment on the same level as say: Fullmetal Alchemist, Fate Zero or Berserk. It’s an aesthetically pleasing experience that while I have gripes with, I can comfortably recommend to fans of battle shonen and newcomers to the anime medium alike.
For you Demon Slayer fans out there, Ufotable is releasing an upcoming movie covering a highly talked about and revered arc in the manga, so keep an eye out for that if you’re interested.",5,Runasius

                Solidly average battle shounen anime. I did enjoy Demon Slayer Season 1. It's a decent watch when you're in the mood to shut off your brain. Super easy to follow, and very linear, straightforward story line. Moreover, it's worth a watch because of its absolutely iconic status. Its movie on the Mugen train arc became #1 grossing of all-time in Japanese box office, adjusted for inflation, and is best enjoyed with watching Season 1. Other positives are an amazing battle soundtrack and battle animation. Battles themselves are interesting to see what new blood demon art will be introduced.
Now, the downsides are the fact that its
                  storyline is so predictable and straightforward. The time between battles are quite boring and replete with odd humor. Lots of manga effects and exaggerated dialogue drive ""humor"" and character development, but it's just not funny or good character development.",5,jaamun100

                The story is intriguing to me. Shounen MC fights demons. That's a pretty typical story idea but the addition of the sibling bond is interesting. Although I don't like that the sister hasn't had much screen time despite already 19 episodes in. 
The art and animation is great. The background is not always the most detailed but the sense of a good setting to set the mood is there. 
The sound, especially for when they are fighting and there are moments when a character falls or crashes into something sounds a little off, but it doesn't change the impact of the fight. 
There seems to
                  be more characters to come, however the 4 most prominant are our MC, his sister, the yellow haired guy, and the boar head guy. Relationships between the characters develop nicely. I like that the MC isn't quick to judge or get mad, he tries to understand and befriend them. 
As to where this story is going is also interesting. Our MC is set on finding the demon who has turned his human sister into a demon so that he can figure out if the process can be reversed. The two are extremely protective of each other and that seems to be his main driving force for continuing to become stronger. 
I hope there's season 2.",8,Umasou_007

                Story
Thes story is fairly generic shounen with nothing unique or groundbreaking.  Lacks depth, so it is easy to get into but at the same time it may bore some viewers. Towards the middle/end of the series, there were some pacing issues and I found myself falling asleep. Sometimes, it takes so long for little to happen. There are some comedic elements but they are very one note and appear abrupptly changing the tone of the series far too frequently. The ""comedy"" did not work the vast majority of the time. I found myself more perplexed with the humor than amused by it. 
Art
Easily the
                  best thing this series got for it is excellent animation and art. It is consistently excellent.
Sound
The opening theme is pretty dope, but other than that nothing too memorable.
Character
Tanjiro, the main character is a kind hearted anime protagonist. Not much else going  for him despite being the main character. Probably one of the least interesting characters in the whole series. Zenitsu is annoying and gets on my nerves. Inosuke is probably the most out there character and is the most likeable of the main cast. The side characters are extremely forgettable and have little development. The main antagonist barely has any development and the most noteworthy thing about him is that he looks like Michael Jackson. 
Enjoyment
The series is definitely pretty, thats easily the best thing I can say about it. The characters are bland, the story is rather bland as well. There are some pacing issues and the comedy doesnt work most of the time. I may not be in the target audience for this series. I feel it was hyped up way too much.

From ufotable, the studio known for its unlimited budget works and stunning animation quality, comes Demon Slayer : Kimetsu no Yaiba. 
My review is based solely on THIS anime, and not whatever may happen next in the movies, manga, next seasons etc. 
With that being said, get those AP shells ready, for there's a lot of plot armor to break through. 
Story : 3/10
The story is as generic as it can be, which is the failproof shonen formula : MC is weak -> MC trains -> MC beats some weak guys -> MC trains -> MC beats stronger guys and so
                  on. Basically the whole story is the Naruto - Orochimaru arc. 99% of times you shouldnt have a hard time predicting exactly what will happen next.  
Art : 10/10
Not much to be said here. The anime has stunning animation, as expected from ufotable. Which is one of the few things that actually made this anime succesful. While the animation is amazing, i had a hard time deciding between a 9 and a 10, mainly because we see amazing ufotable animation ever since 2012 in fate/zero, and the difference is not that significant. 
Sound : 10/10
Music by Yuki Kajiura should be enough said here. Of course, ufotable plays a major part as well regarding overall sound effects. 
Character : 4/10 
The caracters are as generic as the story. Over the course of the 26 episodes, no character ever said something worth remembering. The script is ~20% made of characters screaming the name of other people, thus making sure you actually remember the name of such otherwise 
unmemorable characters. The brotherly love between MC and his sister is not even close what it wants to be, and feels rather forced and not exactly believeable. There are 2 aspects regarding character development that are actually decently well made : the training of the MC, which doesn't feel rushed unlike other animes, and the backstory of every dying demon, which is a good way to make the viewer feel attached to the less important characters. Except those moments are usually ruined by MC and his constant dilema of "" I wanna be a demon slayer but this demon seems like a nice guy. "" 
Enjoyment : 7/10
If you happened to like one of those generic shonens, its pretty hard to find one that's bad enough for you to dislike it. Following this pattern, kimetsu no yaiba was good regarding enjoyment.

Demon Slayer is a show that I would not allow myself to get caught up in the hype for. Whenever the anime community really gets behind a show/film, it can only degrade the overall enjoyment of it. So I turned my ears off for this show; I completely ignored everything about it until episode 25 came out. Then I watched every episode within a week so that I only had one more episode to watch. So here's my conclusion:
The show is pretty great. It does however have some serious deadspots that really hamper the overall enjoyment. I want to say there's like, three
                  spots within the first season (26 episodes) where my enjoyment took a real nosedive. 
So uFotable are the guys and gals making this show. I'm not entirely sure if they outsourced any key animation to any other studios so I'm going to assume it was all them. The show looks amazeballs. Like seriously, this is a tv series right? Not a movie? Ok just checking. It's actually pretty easy to tell it is a tv series though because like with a lot of modern anime these days, the show is littered with some pretty hideous time-saving CG moments. Now I'm not saying CG is bad, I'm saying the easy to spot, lazy ass CG moments are. There are numerous moments where a character running/walking is relegated to some pretty immersion breaking CG. Besides these moments though, the show is absolutely breathtaking to watch. UFotable's mastery of special effects is fully on display here. The battle scenes are just so breathtaking to watch. I am also pleased to say that my main issue with them (the super static looking dialogue scenes that plague their content such as Fate/Zero) seems to be almost gone completely. They've really fixed the boring downtime scenes. 
Great sound design. Unlike some other studios that just make every loud thing sound like some distorted mess (COUGH Fate/Apocrypha COUGH), there is some really great sound design both within the fight scenes and the everyday stuff. The music is very fitting. They took the time to make motifs that are both easy to notice but also fit in with the general flow of the show. The voice actors are also really great. They really brought a extra umph to these characters.
Characters, yeah pretty great across the board. I love the main cast, I love the super OP characters that we only get one episode's worth of content of, yeah I love all of them. The chemistry and dynamics between Tanjirou and Nezuko was fantastic and by the end of the show, the trio of swordsmen that we will undoubtedly keep following is such a joy to see. However, I cannot overlook how underdeveloped the VAST MAJORITY of them are after 26 EPISODES of content. While I love the character interactions, the development is something else entirely worse.
I really, really did enjoy this show. However, no matter how high the high points were, those deadzones really sapped my overall enjoyment for this show. The pacing was just too erratic and it's because of that I cannot give this something like a 9/10. I'm hoping the next season(s)/movie(s) have a much more balanced pacing. But yeah totally fucking watch this.

                One of the most controversial and objectively widely spread in the concerning conversation is the importance of “good” animation, notice how I highlighted that adjective for how different fluent and good animation, responsive animation, animation that adapts, remains consistent and overall, doesn't mask out the importance of the plot.
Does a good animation make up for a flawed plot? Does it improve mediocre writing? Or does the plot and everything else make up for the lack of it? For one, animation is a core part of what makes Anime... AnImE. Not only is it in the name (Anim-e-ation) but it's what separates it from its source
                  material, be it Manga, Light Novels, Games ...etc.
“Kimetsu no Yaiba” (Demon Slayer) was on the better-good side in all of this. I'm by every respect new to Ufotable, “Gyo” was the only production of them that I had ever seen, and oh boy was it a disappointment. Probably at the time, I had labeled it together with Toei Animation and Studio Pierrot, but after watching this newborn Shounen marvel, the disappointment was in myself for not doing enough homework, of course, they are the folks behind the Fate series, so why would this be any more of a surprise? This installment has for sure secured their name next to the mainstream highly praised Mad House, Kyoto Animation, Studio Bones and the likes...
Story (8/10):
Just another tiring snowy day, Tanjirou comes back home to find his family slaughtered in his front door, it must have been the world of a wild animal, a hungry bear passing by, it has to, the house is isolated in the middle of what seems like an empty forest, and his family's corpses have all gotten cold in bruises already, except for his Sister Nezuko who he happens to carry and run to see a doctor for her immediately. To his surprise, what has always been a tale of old, with savage claws and wild look, Nezuko stands up as nothing happened to her, and straight went for the kill. Realizing that his sister has become what is known as a Demon, a flesh-eating mysterious race that lives off human blood, set off to look for a cure, hoping that one day he would lift this curse from his beloved sister.
Bit by bit, he finds himself rolling for an anti-demon organization called the Demon Slayers, climbing up the ranks to hopefully one day have a shot at lifting this eternal curse off of his young Nezuko.
The series spans 26 episodes, which tells serializing story through bursts of short and related arcs, significantly fast pace that doesn't sleep on any sneaked up filler if there was any.
At a cellular core, it is still a Shounen story and a mediocre one at that. I did not feel any complicated plot threads of any trace of a plot twist that keeps you thinking, but Ufotable's magnificent work almost made up for everything accountable.
Art (9.5/10):
Without a doubt, the best “consistent” animation of the year, no contest, and note how I'm highlighting the consistency of it, because of phenomenal shows like Mob Psycho 100 II, Kaguya-sama love is war, Attack on Titan to name a few have blessed 2019 with some of the best visuals in the industry. I'm not going to say that Kimetsu no Yaiba surpasses all of them in every department, however, the consistency part stays faithful to the same degree of perfection through its serialization.
I don't have a huge experience with CGI heavy show, the thought of it has always scared me that I couldn't give a majority of shows a chance, however starting to watch this show, it took me a long time to even notice that all this time, CGI was always prominent, but how couldn't I notice it sooner? Because it was done well. It might be the best example I've seen of such implementation as it kept me begging for more for the first time in my life.
The special effects department was the selling point for me, and probably for most people, so unique and fresh that I started to associate with the show as a primary flench, if that wasn't enough, the use of high frame rate animation boost the visual capabilities and enhances the experience miles above your average 24 fps show, it's almost as not wanting to go back. It makes the slow-motion (Which looks incredible in this show) scenes look tons of times better and more intense, the sense of scale and impact is perfectly emulated through the use of impact frame and 3D cinematography trickery that puts the show in a visual level on its league.
The character designs were vivid, full of life, despite their dead-inside eyes. They reflect their personalities in a great manner and help them indicate their importance by blending each one of them differently with their surrounding backgrounds.
Sound (9/10):
It is shocking to hear that a 26 episodes long show nowadays would only feature a single pair opening and ending theme songs, but Kimetsu no Yaiba did one each, and did them so well that you no longer start asked for another one, because once you hear those two, you get a special kind of vocal fulfillment that reflect perfectly on the mood of the series. I would even be fine if they end up reusing them for the upcoming sequels too. The soundtrack records were phenomenal, one of the best, they have a presence, they have emotion, they have intensity, they are almost a physical 3rd party that's present during every necessary moment of hype, sadness, or happiness.
I don't think there were any complaints about the voice actors and actresses from the fandom at all, which only praises the skilled cast members selected to perform this spectacle.
Characters (8/10):
Let's get the skeletal character design out of the picture first, unique and fresh, it gave me some strong vibes of a mixture between Boku no Hero Academia and Yakusoku no Neverland. Characters appear short but bulky. The clothing varies from place to place, almost telling a separate story of time and struggle. Extremely colorful just like the world they inhabit, with distinct hairstyles, creative eye color palette, and radiating charisma that matches its skeleton.
While nothing groundbreaking, it takes the norm and levels it up, cleans up the mesh and exposes the cliché troop, almost ridiculing it. Tanjitou is your casual Shounen protagonist that's filled with energy, determination, and a dream to fulfill, yet, he remains to be a chill and calm (for a protagonist) dude that doesn't get on the nerve.
People would nominate Nezuko to be the best female of the year, but I wouldn't stand behind that seeing how 90% of the time, she's sleeping inside of a wooden box, not much proper screen time to begin with. The duo Inosuke and Zenitsu are complementary to each other, the same way a savage beast and a cowardly cat would interact with each other, but don't let that cliché facade scare you away, as they do have personal interests into making plot-level decisions.
Muzen, that makes up for the villain is also an interesting figure that spreads sinister deeds throughout the series, raising a culprit question in the first episode and remaining there to stay till the very last with a common but interesting ideology that remains to be explored.
Enjoyment (9/10):
I remember when the community was on heels for this show when it was first starting, I don't jump on the seasonal bandwagon very early on, so I gave the shows serializing ta the time some accumulation time for me to start binging whatever content I catch up on, and Kimetsu no Yaiba was there for me, but a bit earlier. The hype and the loud praise I hear had me start watching when it was still 5 episodes in, and for a show of +25 it's quite unusual for me to rush in whilst the first chunk of 12 episodes isn't there yet. The hype was real, it was honest and welcoming from the get-go. I had my fair share of waiting weekly for new episodes and even a greater blast presenting it to my siblings. The lack of shameless fan service makes it easy to recommend to the public too.
2019 was packed for great shows already, and this gem made a name of itself even with all the clutter.
Overall (8.7/10):
In short, Kimetsu no Yaiba is an experience that one shall not pass on, it is sure to become a classic among the new horde of this decade's Anime, and watching it while serializing was definitely something to tell the people of tomorrow, for it is only a sparkling growing series that shall one day be praised and paired together with the titans of this medium, the same way the big three were.
It is a show that can be rewatched several times, a show that can be binged without getting bored easily, a show that shall and will be remembered and brought up into conversations in the coming years, for how a masterful visual production value it had going for it, and almost lustful vocal complements as well, a piece hard to come up with criticism for but also very easy to hate.",8,Eoussama

                Demon Slayer is a staple of good animation. The story respect for each character and each villain is a beauty in its own right. Its like watching a shoenen art on screen. Therefore it should be rated highly, right?
To be honest at a critical stand point it shouldn't be so. I feel exactly that, its a shoenen art on screen. One moment its a well developed character and story drama, the next a typical shoenen humor. From Drama, to horror, to humor, to thriller, shoenen action. I feel that the many mood swings put the story off at a critical stand point. I just don't
                  think the transition is smooth enough.
personal critique:
Story plot/telling:7 (overall story of main cast has potential but needs to grow)
Character value: 9 (great respect to each character and villain as each has a story)

                Demon Slayer has a good premise with a very likable main character in Tanjiro and great animation. However, the lack of development for its supernatural elements, a couple poor main characters, and a bundle of plot holes made it more difficult for me to enjoy at times.
Let me state up front, that immersion is the first thing I look to when critiquing serious narratives with supernatural elements. If that immersion is broken multiple times over, I won't like the show as much. This is what happened with Demon Slayer. 
The show has a good start that sets a clear narrative to follow through on. Tanjiro's
                  training was short but fun to watch and had some elements of mystique that got me interested. I was enjoying it quite a lot until just after Tanjiro officially becomes a Demon Slayer. The reason being that a very obvious plot hole was prevalent in the next fight that showed blatant favoritism toward the main character. 
Yes, the main character is normally going to win fights in which he would otherwise perish, but I instantly thought ""What if the Demon just did this?"" It looked to me as if Tanjiro made a foolish decision and got lucky, but it's presented as an amazing victory for him. That kick-started a whole slew of criticisms throughout the middle of the season. I won't go in depth on the plot holes or any nitpicking I did with its supernatural elements because this might only pertain to my enjoyment of the series, and I'd rather not ruin the series for others in this way. 
I lost interest in the series once the supposed main characters Zenitsu and Inosuke made their appearance. Zenitsu as a character does not make any sense to me. I don't like it when characters just shout all the time; it is annoying. I also couldn't help but criticize his abilities; maybe they're actually fine and I was just too biased by my current impression of the show. I'll never know. Inosuke is a bit better, but is too simple to be a main character. He's pretty much defined by his desire to fight and be the strongest. I found myself far more intrigued in a couple side characters introduced later on.
I ended up giving the series another chance after some time remembering how much I liked the beginning of the show. When I returned I was still somewhat disappointed until I got to see a couple stellar fights ... one of which had absolutely amazing animation and some surprisingly grand narrative weight. I can't really do it justice with words. You should watch the series for the one fight alone.
From then on I found myself really enjoying the show again. Quite the turnaround! The two new characters that came in at this point are much more interesting to me than the previous additions. The insect swords-woman Kochou, Shinobu caught my attention in part because she's really appealing but also because she seemed genuinely conflicted about a specific dilemma she and the other Pillars faced when the others were basically like ""this is how it has to be"". Her disciple Kanao also caught my attention. Kanao's character is unique without being so unrealistic that it's a turnoff ... like Zenitsu was for me. And I really enjoyed Tanjiro's interactions with them.
I ended up liking this first season overall and would recommend it to others knowing that it'll likely be more entertaining for them than it was for me. However, I have little attachment to the series because of plot holes/inconsistencies and some of what I think is weak character writing. Despite the amount of violence in this show, it comes off as more of a kids show with not enough effort put in to give the series consistent depth.",7,ghier

                This review contains some spoilers
English is not my main language, I'm trying my best.
I'm gonna divide this review in both parts: the positive points and the negative points.
Positive points:
 Kimetsu no Yaiba (or Demon Slayer) is the shounen that I ever wanted: no power taken from the ass and a good plot (not like DBZ and many others). To start, the music, sounds may be comparated to a AAA game, Ufotable got me impressed and certainly I'm gonna make a playlist with music of Kimetsu no Yaiba. The simphony of the sounds...
 Now, about art and animation. Incredible! In importantless fights, Ufotable economize animation with a CG and maybe you didn't even looked at CG because it's pretty. Oh, I almost forgot! The special attacks from Tanjirou and others! Manga draws and them combinations -are amazing!
Next and last point: the growing up of characters. We see the journey of Tanjirou trying to help his sister turned in an Oni (monsters). We see he feels weak, getting stronger,having questions... and his imprudence against Hashiras. I felt more empathy with Inosuke, do you remember when he felt weak after ep. 19? He's a classic Man: ""I NEVER WILL GIVE UP"" ""I'M STRONG!"" ""LET'S GO HAVE A FIGHT TO PROVE I'M STRONGER THAN YOU!!"".
Negative points:
 How can Tanjirou smell feelings? It is like a stupid """"power"""" just created for convenience.
The worst and best character is unquestioanblely Zenitsu. He's sexist and annoying. Some parts I had to jump because I couldn't hear him but, he can be impressionable and feeling some empathy.
That's it! I don't like a lot of shounen but Kimetsu no Yayba impressed me!",8,Peixefaca

                I enjoyed watching this. This is one of the prettiest animes I've ever seen. But is it a shounen masterpiece that will be talked about for years to come? No.
Story: Classic. A boy taking up sword in order to take revenge for his dead family. The story isn't the most engaging one in the market, because even though the premise is quite promising, the execution is meh:
1) The transition between one arc and the other isn't as smooth as I'd like. It feels choppy at times. The pacing is terrible. I felt like some scenes are so drawn out even though it could've concluded way
                  quicker
2) There's a lot of unnecessary flashback scenes that took up precious screen time, hence why even after 26 episodes of anime it felt like barely scratched the surface.
3) This anime /wanted/ to be emotional, but some scenes just felt shallow and cliched even though it's supposed to make us feel something. There are a few great ones, though, but not all of them are as successfully tragic and/or touching as intended
4) The gag scenes isn't the funniest I've ever seen; just like everything else, they are extremely drawn out at times
Art: The redemption point of this anime - if it weren't for the pretty art, I would give this a 6. The colours are vibrant and pretty. The character design is extremely pleasing in the eyes. It's a great mix of fluid animation with the more rough artistic animation when it comes to the special techniques.
Character: Tanjirou is surprisingly strong for a main character in a shounen anime. You can't possibly hate him. He's not a dumb, wimpy brat who slowly grew into this larger than life figure as he hones himself in the road of Samurai - Tanjirou has always been a great character. He's the eldest child in a family of six, so his gentle and encouraging demeanour makes a lot of sense. He's extremely kind, for someone who literally saw his entire family dead save for one little sister. His traveling companions, Inosuke and Zenitsu, are pretty refreshing and mostly there for comedic relief, even though their characters complement Tanjirou's well. Nezuko doesn't really show a lot of character since she doesn't speak much, but she's an important part in keeping Tanjirou sane (doesn't hurt that she's extremely cute, too)
Overall, this anime is pretty good. It's a no-brainer shounen anime which doesn't take a lot of brainpower to follow, and it's pretty enjoyable. Though, you won't find anything groundbreaking nor mindblowingly interesting. Kimetsu no Yaiba is no masterpiece; it's just harmless fun.",7,ranwan

                The story was all around pretty solid, but the show was way too long. The pace starts really dragging and they even have to put in a bunch of filler episodes, so I guess there just wasn't enough story to make an interesting twenty-some episode series. I understand some people will appreciate that they actually take their time during the training parts, but it feels like they had to in order to actually get out a full episode of content each week. Most of the characters are pretty uninteresting and some are straight annoying. I don't get why anyone would find this orange haired dude
                  funny. The stuff he's able to do later on doesn't really justify any of that either. Probably my favorite character was the youngest butterfly girl. Having to flip a coin to convince herself to make a decision is pretty relatable stuff. But overall, nothing very interesting about the show. The episode 19 everyone loves was some of the most literal shounen trope usage I think I've ever seen. It was as if someone took a university lecture on the appeal of Naruto and submitted episode 19 as their final project. I guess the effect was there, but some of those concepts were so random it felt pretty forced.",5,pumpkinboy

                I finished watching this in one one day, I recommend doing it this way. Beginning is great, love it. You then meet ,as I like to refer to them boar boy and banana head (Inosuke and Zenitsu) around the middle part of the anime. Boar boy will be annoying in the beginning because he wants to be the best in everything and keeps wanting to fight. Don't worry within a few episodes this calms down and you'll actually enjoy him as a character. Now my problem is with banana boy. He almost made me want to stop watching this anime. He is ANNOYING as all
                  get out. He's annoying in every episode for about 5 min each. Which overall is a lot of time. Any fight that happens he cries or hides behind someone. I explain to you my overall hate for him >.<. Once you get to the episodes in the woods luckily the story mostly follows our main guy along with boar boy with a episode to a maybe episode and a half of banana head. Then after this character development happens for everyone in a much needed way. If you do get iffy like me to continue watching it hold out till episodes 19 and 20 they are AMAZING!!! This will secure your trust in the show and you'll be happy again :p",9,LittleVixenpop

                I got into this because I know how popular it has become, and a debate on the protagonist's earrings filled up my timeline some weeks ago.
Four things drove me to keep watching this: the animation (so FREAKING GOOD AND AWESOME, voice acting, music (I gotta Google who that composer is) and characters.
The story, sadly, is the letdown. It has enough to pique my interest, but I feel like the story-telling is very basic. And sometimes, the characters say too much (kind of like when reading novels: they're telling--literally talking--rather than showing), which irked me more than once. It's also very slow-paced, and I found myself
                  fast-forwarding plenty of times. I think this could've been well paced with only 19-20 episodes, but I doubt there's any channel that would agree to setting a timeslot for an anime for only one and a half seasons.
Overall, it's a good anime. It's not the best out there, but it wasn't a waste of time, either.",7,misomilk

                The emotional reaction I had after watching each episode of Demon Slayer this year was unlike anything I've gotten from an anime before. Never before had a show given me such an intense feeling of disappointment that it turned to gut-wrenching sadness -- I felt like something was wrong with me for not liking such a hugely well received series. Despite waiting this long to let the hype die down, I can't help but feel Demon Slayer robbed me of time better spent. 
-Story-
Tanjiro Kamado's journey starts with tragedy in the early episodes of Demon Slayer, as he returns from the local village to find
                  his family dead in the snow, and the smell of demons in the air. They've all been murdered -- except for one. Nezuko, Tanjiro's sister, survives the attack, only to be infused with the demonic blood of their assailant. Seeing this, Tanjiro's love for his sister only grows stronger as he vows to protect Nezuko, find the demon responsible for her transformation, and reverse it. In the pursuit of his goal Tanjiro joins the Demon Slayer Corps, an organization of skilled fighters looking to end the terror demons reign through Japan, to strike down the monsters who killed his family. 
This is a simple but effective plot, largely due to how likable the main character is from the start. Tanjiro's drive to save his sister is clear in everything he does and easy to get behind as a viewer, and painless to understand. Too often you see shows or movies that take too long to explain the ""hook"", but Demon Slayer is as simple as it gets. Unfortunately, that simplicity is also its downfall. Even as the plot progresses, it never becomes more complex (for the viewer, or for the characters we're watching.) The story plateaus a third of the way in, and I found myself taking long breaks between episodes because the events were so painfully dull from being easy to predict. I never found that ""spark of excitement"" the series desperately needed to keep me wanting more. 
-Character-
Despite being likable at the beginning, Tanjiro falls to the same undoing as the story. His simple character never changes, and his one-note personality becomes grating well before the halfway point. You know Tanjiro will always say and do the right thing, he will always succeed in the end, and his beliefs are never challenged. While simple, yet likable characters are aplenty in the shōnen genre, Tanjiro lacks that tell-tale power creep to enjoy. After the initial training arc, he does not get stronger in the series or develop new powers or abilities to show off. Anything ""new"" are just moves we haven't seen yet, or something he remembers deus ex machina style. Even in those ""make-or-break"" moments, he's hardly in any danger -- Tanjiro fights just as well with broken ribs as he does freshly healed. 
Demon Slayer even bails on it's own attempts at character development. When Tanjiro kills a demon we are regularly lectured with their backstory to paint even the worst enemies in sympathetic light, but it’s a failed attempt in every way. Creating empathy for a villainous character is one thing, but this lacks all effectiveness when that character dies seconds later. A better show would have this impact him, make him question his resolve by seeing how the demons suffer just as he does. Instead, Tanjiro forgets as quickly as it happens and we are left with an insufferable ending to a potentially memorable fight. 
Other characters don't fare any better. The two main side characters, Zenitsu and Inosuke, seem to be an attempt at comic relief, but only if you think screaming every line is funny. It's an incredible blunder that this anime has not one, but two people whose main character trait involves yelling about anything and everything, but in different ways so there's not even overlap -- just a wider spectrum of screeching. To the show's credit, they are fleshed out with backstories, but that does nothing to remedy their one note natures. You'll have no difficulty finding people who abandoned Demon Slayer when Zenitsu and Inosuke join, and I can't blame them for a second. 
-Art and Sound- 
It's a shame the characters are so poorly done, because their designs are top class. In a medium known for beautiful eyes, Demon Slayer takes it to the next level of visual design. Each set of eyes adds another level of personality to even minor characters, and by breaking the model of ""typical eyes"", you'll never see two that look the same in this anime. They say a good character design is recognizable only by it's silhouette, and even minor characters pull this off without seeming overdesigned. The art and design is often the most praised thing about Demon Slayer, and for good reason. 
However, that's not to say it's flawless. CG in anime is commonplace nowadays, to the point it's not about if you're using it rather how well you're using it. Demon Slayer falls on the poorer end of that scale. There are several times, especially in the early episodes, where it's painfully obvious 3D models are being used but not to the benefit of the scene. Typically 3D models can allow anime to do interesting things with the camera, and manipulate the scene in ways hand drawing can't. I can't help but feel Demon Slayer doesn't take advantage of that, and plays it safe with fairly standard shots. That's not to say it doesn't show off the art well, but it once again contributes to missing that ""spark of excitement"" I continued searching for. 
Sound runs into the same dilemma. Good sound design is something so natural you don't notice, but even better sounds and music amplify a scene until the two are inseparable in your memory. I don't remember anything especially bad about the sounds and music, but nothing especially good stands out either. Thinking back, it almost feels like a blank slate that could be filled with anything. 
It says a lot, when my excitement while watching Demon Slayer only grew when I was getting closer and closer to finally being done. I get a sinking feeling every time I think back on what a slog each episode was to watch, and how much I truly wanted to enjoy this show like my friends do. While I don't understand what they see in Demon Slayer, I can admit to its potential. I wanted to state my issues with Demon Slayer not because I enjoy mocking things people enjoy, but because these can be fixed. With its popularity earning a second season,  if these issues aren't resolved then I can see even big fans losing their patience with one-note characters, predictable plots, and great art hampered by lackluster presentation. As things stand now, these flaws are the biggest demon in Demon Slayer.",5,quickring15

                TL;DR : Overused shitty fanfare.
The manga was one of the readings i've enjoyed most these last two years, while i sincerely don't recall having been so irritated for an animated adaptation in my life.
While the manga delivers while being down-to-earth 
I tolerated how this animated adaptation is trying to milk the most out of the source... and the absymally low quality voice acting of certains characters (the one for the temari demon was incredibly retarded and irritating, in particular).
I tolerated the nonsensical little changes: in the manga, before Yushiro goes back to Tamayo, he comically tells Tanjiro to cover his own mouth since he's tired
                  of that, while in the anime he delivers cringe)
I tolerated how they made more gruesome what was tame... but tamed Tanjiro's distress for almost having his body ripped apart by the ""arrows"", he looked almost like he was crawling for fun.
What really got me disgusted though was the sound.
Oh dear god whoever they hired for curing the music part was an absolute dunce.
Generic ""epic"" 20 seconds of drums-strings-fanfare during ALL of the fights edited and/or in loop.
THE SAME IDENTICAL fragment, ALWAYS.
Only exception was the disgusting beatbox: not that i can't stand hearing beatbox as background music, but imagine a japanese dude who's not good at it making a terrible imitation while spitting saliva everywhere.
What's worse is that they've put trash background music everywhere it was possible, even when the characters were idle chatting...
 The shitty fanfare was present at the end of ep. 10 whent the pathetic Zenitsu appears begging a girl to marry him.
Fortunately i don't need to torture myself for more 6 seasons of this to know the story, since i've already finished the manga.",3,Terryss

                Honestly, I feel like I let this one lie for too long and the hype really built up around it so that when I finally got around to watching this I just found it massively underwhelming. I wasn't a fan of the art style, and though the animation definitely made up for that in parts I still wasn't really blown away by it. Add in a few annoying characters (like Zenitsu) and I was annoyed more than entertained for some episodes. There was nothing that really stood out beyond that in either a positive or negative light - the story was kind of basic and
                  didn't really do anything that blew me away, and I wasn't really invested in any of the characters either. I can see why something like this would gain popular appeal, but ultimately it just didn't really do much for me.",6,meg_lowde

                      I went into demon slayer with really high expectations and heard so many great things about it. It even won anime of the year last year, and I can say now that I wasn’t completely disappointed. The characters are a hit or miss for me. Zenetsu, is annoying as all hell anytime he’s on-screen except for some occasional cool moments but other than that he makes the show hard to watch. Inosuke is okay, much like Zenetsu. He has one character trait that is repeated in each episode but I didn’t find Inosuke to be annoying.  Nezuko was cool but they couldn’t do much with her character because she doesn't talk which I didn’t mind. Tanjiro is your average shounen mc there is nothing unique about his character but I still think he is solid. The story is basic as hell which isn’t necessarily a bad thing if other elements of the show can work with the story to make it more enjoyable. And it does work, the action is amazing and the art and animation are sexy. To top it off the battle music added to the intensity of the fights. Unfortunately, the writing is incredibly weak and can come off as really corny at times. Cardboard has more life than these characters and writing 
     Overall, Demon Slayer has outstanding art, animation, and action that compliments the story. Unfortunately, that can’t save the weak writing and the hit or miss characters.",6,CrewCONTROL

                Kimetsu no Yaiba, a cliche anime that still holds you from start to finish. Demon slayer tells the story of our protagonist Tanjiro who goes to sell coal in the village where he lives and when he returns his family has been murdered and only his younger sister Nezuko is left, who has become a demon.
The animation of this anime is something surreal, one of the best animations I've ever seen, the soundtrack is good too and the opening is amazing, about the story it's a little cliche, but even so, you still like it, another thing I like much in Kimetsu is the organization
                  of power, as they divide each hunter into specific groups, such as Mizunotos through Hashiras and the Upper and Lower Moons.
About the characters, they are well developed, especially the upper moons, such as Akaza (referring to the manga), but I would like to take more advantage of the lower moons, the only ones that had some moment of greater prominence were just Rui and Emmu and the secondary characters too could be better developed, like Aoi.
My favorite character is Kanao, I love her evolution from the anime to the manga, how she managed to surpass her master Shinobu, I also like her sarcastic personality in the manga, I admit I loved seeing her kill Douma.
The deaths are very impactful, even from the lower and upper moons, the flashbacks make you like even a villain, like Rui, and the hashira deaths are very touching too, the most exciting for me was Shinobu's, which is one of my favorites too.
The anime also shows the friendship relationship of the main trio, Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inosuke, the relationship of Tanjiro and Nezuko as good brothers, it has some drama and comedy scenes that really hooked me.
Anyway, I love this anime and the manga too, I underestimated it for a long time thinking it was just another cliche shounen anime, but it managed to surprise me, I recommend it especially if you like action and adventure anime.",10,sop12

                I've only seen 11 episodes and the last thing this mediocre-at-best padded-to-hell kids show needed was a dumbass screaming his head off all the time. I thought this was called Demon Slayer not Screaming Slayer.
How the fuck is that annoying yellow idiot one of the most popular characters? Why does every shounen protagonist need to have a stupid best friend? Can people not enjoy their anime without forced ""comic relief""?  Showing Tanjiro trapped in a creepy mansion completely controlled by a demon, then cutting to this moron yelling with his eye-bugging out just ruins the tension and atmosphere.  This show doesn't need ""comedy""
                  and it doesn't need all this padding. Seriously, it's episode 11 and the plot has almost completely halted in favor of Naruto-filler-esque episodic stuff. A bird tells Tanjiro to go to random place, he goes and meets random people terrorized by demons, he and Nezuko kill them and take off, the bird tells him to go to new random place, rinse and repeat.
It wouldn't be so bad if the characters were interesting, but the only one I care about is Nezuko, and even she's just a typical moe-bait waifu. I'm curious about Shinobu (more moe-bait), but I can't stand that lemon-colored coward for a moment longer to get to the episode she appears in.

                *This review contains spoilers*
 Let's start with the positive aspects: beautiful animation and design, with captivating battle choreographies. The voice acting and music is acceptable, not remarkably good, just acceptable. Having said that, here comes all the criticism.
This story is a classic shounen full of cliches. After a snowy night and some scary demon tales, our main character Tanjiro goes home only to find his family slaughtered by some mysterious entity. The only survivor of the massacre, his sister Nezuko, is unconcious. For some reason, seeing blood and guts everywhere didn't even shock Tanjiro, who inmediatly took Nezuko down the mountain, only to be surprised
                  halfway with the girl turning into a ""demon"".
 She instantly tries to attack Tanjiro but he's somehow able to make her reason, and inmediatly after save her from being decapitated by the first demon-slayer introduced: Tomioka. The wonderful power of love and bonds takes over the stage in this moment, with Tanjiro convincing Tomioka to let his sister live, claiming that she is different and he will find a way to restore her humanity. After succesfully applying Naruto's evangelizer techniques, this flat and inconsistent adventure starts. 
 It's important to note that every fucking demon we see talks, but for some reason, Nezuko becomes mute (and apparently dumb) after turning. (I also wonder what's exactly the point of giving a muzzle to a demon that supposedly doesn't attack humans). I'm baffled by the fact that neither her nor Tanjiro seem to have any signs of PTSD after the horrific things they witnessed; in fact, in the case of Tanjiro, thoughts or memories of his family never come back to hunt him, despite him seeing a lot things that mirror what he experienced. He never seems to be deeply shaken by any emotion at any situation, making him actually cold-hearted. This mere fact is why I don't understand the series effort of portraying  him as this very sensitive character, who can even sympathize with disgusting creatures any normal person would hate and/or fear. This guy is unnafected by his past and said ""oh well, whatever"" when his master hypnotized his beloved sister to make her love humans and hate demons. But well, fuck it! Power of love! Save sister! Me good, demon bad, forgive demons cuz the were hooman once bro!
 Tanjiro's companions, Inosuke and Zenitsu, aren't any better I guess. Zenitsu was thought as a comic relief but feels like a pain in the ass, being a extremely exaggerated coward whose only motivation seems to be getting chicks. It's sad because his sword's style was the most cool for me, but that was obscured by the exacerbated stupidity of his character. Inosuke is at least a bit more solid: the cliche of the sharp-instinct warrior, who seems rough but secretly craves love and acceptance from others. He's also the only one who seems to get a bit of personality development as the series progresses.
 Summing up: character construction is shallow and sometimes cringy. 
 Now I'd like to point out some events of the story, which isn't very well crafted by the way.
 First one: the final exam to become a demon slayer. Is it efficient to make such a difficult test where the rate of survival is so low? I mean, there was a demon in the forest who lived there for decades and ate dozens of warriors. This demon seemed to be way ahead of the newbies league. Shouldn't they fight against demons that are up to their level? This kind of shows always remark that improvement of abilities demands a lot of time and hardwork so, why don't you preserve a bit your people? Obviously most of them won't reach a hashira-like level of proficiency, but why whould they need to? There's also a power hierarchy for demons, and this infested world clearly needs as much soldiers as it can get.
 Right after Tanjiro and four other participants pass the exam, someone claims ""oh, this time a lot of them survived"", which leads me to the other event I wanted to point out: the battle between Tanjiro's team against the spider-user demons. 
 When our favorite team reachs the battlefield, they find at least ten young comrades (of higher rank) who where being easily defeated.Tanjiro and his friends almost instantly find out how to fight back these strange powers, and take the upper-hand. This leads me to wonder about two things:
- How can there be so much young demon-slayers if it was claimed that almost no one survives the final exam?
- Why do side characters like this have to be so useless compared to our protagonists?
 I mean, it just doesn't make sense that some random dudes who have just began their journey are far superior that their comrades of higher rank, with much more experience (and ability, we suppose). Power levels of our characters fluctuate too quickly and seem to be, at least for me, inconsistent,
I would like to point out other things but right now I'm getting really tired, so I might edit this review later.
 I want to finish saying that, in spite of all my criticism, I found Demon Slayer to be interesting enough to keep me alert until the last chapter. The dark atmosphere, beautiful battles and wide variety of demon abilities kept me expecting more. I hope the next seasons will offer us something more solid in terms of storyline and character development.",5,St3fo

                I unironically enjoyed this less than Pui Pui Molcar. The story started off generic, but strong during the first episode. Even though I was a bit confused, like is Nezuko the only demon who had loved who she was trying to kill? What made her different? It felt a bit contrived but I was willing to stick with it. After that though, all interest to finish the show disappeared. The show goes from a serious, gritty, and violent show to a wannabe comedy with more tonal whiplash than watching the finale of Banana Fish right after watching an episode of Seinfeld. It will go from
                  an incredibly animated fight scene to unlikable and generic characters interacting in a way that I think was supposed to be funny. The show likes to do that thing that Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood does where the animation quality goes down to simple drawings, just a little more than stick figures for the comedy, but where FMA uses this to great affect and it always fits the situation and makes you laugh, Demon Slayer overuses it for underwhelming jokes and eventually I thought they were just doing it to save budget because they needed to add in another cool fight scene with the water sword. So here we have a show that has awful characters, awful humor and writing, a villain who looks like Michael Jackson, a generic premise, and that's greatest asset, the animation, falls apart most of the time, excluding the fight scenes. Honestly a complete waste of time and I would recommend this to nobody. I got to around episode 15 and then dropped it because it was that bad.

                handsdown the most overrated anime of all time. this was painful to watch i would’ve preferred watching human centipede 100times over this.
i have never wrote a review but this one really takes the cake. the characters are so annoying it was dreadful to listen to them. the jokes are made for quite literally 3years old laughing about snort..? the only character with a personality is the over the head in love annoying that his entire personality trait is being scared of trees. i had no enjoyment watching this show. the art is the only thing i was very much liking since the artstyle is awesome,
                  beside that everything is bad. from beginning to end. i’d say this was made for anime beginners (watchers?) but even so i do not understand how such low humour and no story was made for beginners…so take it as you want but you’ll probably regret watching this.",2,Zastela

                To be very hnest, I used to be addicted to anime and nowadays I don't even watch it anymore cause I find it hard to find some good anime. But I must say. I really liked this. 
The art is just incredible, very innovative, and animation is mindblowing. From someone who really appreciates the art of animation, it's hard to appreciate anime as a good animation cause it's more about frozen frames that only move the essentials. I didn't even believe that weekly animes could actually animate that well, since they gotta produce 20 minutes in 1 week, which is very hard and impossible if
                  you actually animate according to the 13 principles of animation. But this series did it, mainly in their battles. I just can't get out of my head the image of Zenitsu attack. It was mindblowing indeed, the direction, the perspective, the animation, how the character moves... It's something I could see from an animation movie. Note 10 for the animation. (In case you're thinking that there are many anime's with good art and I'm just stupid, let me explain that I agree: good art, but animation isn't the same thing and they must be evaluated separately. This anime has both)
For the story, I'm often very picky with storytelling. At first, I thought the story was quite basic - same as others demon slayers stories. Nevertheless, it's written in a way that keeps your interest, so it's good, overall. There is only one thing that makes it unique: Nezuko's character and the siblings relationship brings a lot of potential to it, and made me watch all the eps with pleasure, but I must say: that potential wasn't used to its fullest, since there were many eps in which she didn't even show up (not even when it was night and she could hang out with the boys). Still, when her character was included, the story just blossomed. I hope the story from now on just includes her more, cause that will make it so much more special. Note 7 - Good, but not very unique.
As for the sound and music: I don't usually pay much attention to it, mainly in animes. I sometimes try to focus on it for a bit, and I did it in the anime. Still, I can't remember anything despite actually focusing on it for a while, so I give it a 6 - It's a positive note since it didn't stand out for clashing with the story, but it did not stand out in my opinion.
As for the characters... I like them a lot, mainly Nezuko, Zenitsu and even Tanjirou. All were very Hufflepuff kind of characters (which means they do the right thing despite of what is written, and that's the most important for them) - which is actually rare for Shounen series, in which main characters would just act impulsively and be a bit of Glory seeking. It's a bit refreshing, but at the same time, they still were shounen characters that yell 90% of the time (except for nezuko, cause she's a girl and she can't speak). So 7 for them.
Overall, as I said, despite many things, the story is told in a way that keeps your attention and interest, so I really enjoyed this. I hope they bring Nezuko to the story line more often from now on since that will make the story stand out as much as the animation does. Give it a 8 cause I'm picky xD",8,Mia_Chan

                Kimetsu no Yaiba: Demon Slayer, is, arguably, one of the best anime series of 2019, despite the fact that initially, it had a mixed reception.
Story: 8/10
The story follows Tanjiro, a young boy who had his family slaughtered by a demon and his sister turned into one. Later on, he sets a goal to bring his sister Nezuko back to normal form.
It’s not the most original story we’ve ever heard, but it’s not a generic one either, as one who watches the anime clearly realizes that there’s more to the story. The story features a variety of unforgettable scenes that are, in my opinion, the best
                  this year, only loosing to Attack On Titan Season 3 Part 2. In general, it’s a very emotional story that you ought to check out.
Art, Animation & Sound: 9/10
The art/animation is probably the best feature of this anime. The art is simply amazing and almost any frame can be used as a wallpaper for your computer, it’s just that good. Not to mention the superb animation of this series, ufotable has definitely done a great job with that. Of course, there are some exceptions to this, mainly in unimportant scenes where the art might not be great, but that’s not a reason to skip this anime. 
The sound is also great, especially in fight scenes. Every fight scene, along with the astonishing animation, includes such great sounds that make them very lively and tense. This is one of the reasons why Kimetsu no Yaiba: Demon Slayer is so popular in the first place.
Character: 7/10
This is the field where this anime lacks the most. The characters are not terrible, but not amazing either. This anime features a variety of characters that despite each one of them being a bit unique in their own way, are simple characters that you can find in any other shonen series. Personally, I believe the villains to be the most interesting characters, as they have great backstories and do not exist as mere obstacles that the protagonist/hero has to pass. 
Enjoyment: 9/10
Despite its flaws, it can be a very entertaining series to watch or to binge-watch, mainly because of its outstanding fight scenes. There is a great balance between serious moments and comedic moments in this anime that make it very enjoying to watch for both audiences that are interested in shonen or serious series. 
Overall, 8/10
Kimetsu no Yaiba: Demon Slayer is a must-watch series for the reasons mentioned above. The flaws mentioned are not to discourage you from watching the anime, but simply to keep you down to earth and not raise your expectations a lot. Definitely check it out!",8,Mike4992

                Sorry to rain on the ""demon slayer is so good"" parade. I wanted to believe in it. Heck, I watched it only because its rated so highly. But I'm sad to say I'm disappointed. All I got to say is, good art/animation, bad story/characters. Overrated show. 
I stand by the belief that a good shounen should be developed over time. I'm not saying it has to be long necessarily- but I'll just say this: the ""shounen"" part of this show lasted two episodes and consisted of cutscenes of our MC running up a hill and dodging traps. Is that what you really call entertainment? Look
                  at the best shounen's out there (by popular opinion, but also my opinion too). FMAB, Hunter x Hunter, Naruto, JoJo (if that counts lmao)... all these shows develop the characters through multiple seasons coherently to get to a final result. The characters in the show genuinely struggle under challenges to build them up. They don't just become gods in one instant. Demon Slayer... let's just say it ignores all that development and gives the whole idea of ""shounen"" a big middle finger, skipping right to the combat. By episode seven, Tanjiro is already a full-fledged chad, killing demons like its nothing and pulling water forms out of his ass with perfect execution. It's like there isn't even any question of whether or not he's developing, because he already knows it all just by training under the dude with the red goblin mask.
Tanjiro, our goody-two-shoes main character, goes from not knowing how to punch air, to wielding a powerful black sword and cutting off the heads of demons like its nothing. He goes from too scared to walk home in the forest at night in episode 1, all the way to wandering around a village with a recent demon attack, trying to ACTIVELY SEEK OUT THE DEMON and kill it, in the span of like seven episodes. What's more, he's doing it all for his sister, who is for some reason brought along on these dangerous journeys, even though the whole point of the show is to protect her!?
That's another huge flaw with the show. Tanjiro wants to turn Nezuko back into a human. But he also wants to protect Nezuko... Then why the hell is he going after perhaps the most dangerous demon (Kibutsuji) and bringing Nezuko with him? Isn't like that the opposite of what he should be doing- keeping Nezuko safe with some demon slayer, and then going on an elite team of demon slayers to find an antidote?
And Tanjiro as a character is annoying. I mean, he's the epitome of ""be a good person, and good things will happen to you"", which is bullshit irl. He's too good of a person, to the point where its unbelievable. Just because he wants to save his sister, he manages to win every fight based off of solely that desire. No skill involved, just ""I need to save Nezuko!"" when he's knocked down, and bam- he wins the fight because he pulls off some crazy stunt that he never even trained for. Every goddamn time.
Let's not mention the two annoying side characters Inosuke and Zenitsu. If you forgot who they were, one is the yellow dude who is a freaking pervert and also a coward who can't stop saying ""TanJirOOO"" in an annoying ass voice. The other one is some random kid with ADHD, who can't take off his pig helmet and can't stop screaming over every dialogue in the show. Also, he can't wear a freaking shirt. What the hell are they even in the show for? If you're gonna give the MC some sidekicks, at least make them half bearable, or give them some meaning as characters. They, consistent with the rest of the show, come out of nowhere and just can't leave Tanjiro's side for whatever reason, even though they have literally nothing to do with him. Then there's Nezuko. Honestly, she doesn't do anything during the show, albeit save Tanjiro's ass a few times and be kawaii, which is annoying to me because there should be more to character like her especially since she's the focus of the whole story
Overall, I think this show is a trainwreck. Yes, the animation and art is amazing, I won't deny it. In fact, its probably some of the best I've ever seen. But the story... my god. If you're looking for a real shounen, watch Hunter x Hunter. Watch FMAB. But please, don't let this show define the genre for you. There is no shounen here, just mindless combat, annoying side characters, a too-pure-to-the-point-where-it's-annoying MC, and a demon loli.
If you value story over animation (which I certainly do) then I don't think you will enjoy this. However if you just want to watch well animation combat scenes and don't care too much about story, then you will enjoy the first season. 
(Also, I realize I'm being a little harsh since the story isn't over yet, there will most definitely be a season 2. So we'll have to see until then. So please don't roast me you diehard fanboys/girls)",7,rma2002

                As beautifully animated as Demon Slayer is, the viewers can't forget that good animation doesn't write a good story. The first season of Demon Slayer can be praised for it's production values, including it's great soundtrack. Still, there wasn't much of substance or that really moved me with the exception of only 1 of it's 26 episodes.
One way to enjoy this series is through the comedy. Though most of it seemed funny, Zenitsu made it almost unbearably annoying and not. At the very least, I can understand now why he is that way. He presents a lesson that though you may run away and cry,
                  it's important to keep going and not give up. Not only that, he is the embodiment of the saying, ""I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times."" He does this in his own way. I found him likeable in the end, but I can't deny he was insufferably obnoxious for a while.
Music wise, the soundtrack is a real treat. Tragically, I often found the music too good for this anime.
I didn't find the characters a strong point. Regardless, Nezuko and Shinobu became my favorite ones. Nezuko seems more interesting than Tanjirou, and I wonder in the mystery behind her. I wonder how it must feel for her to get tossed around in the box constantly as Tanjiro fights. In that position she is convenient for the plot whenever her brother is in trouble as well. This doesn't take away from all the adorable and grandiose screen time she gets. Shinobu's personality is sinister yet hilarious. Though she appears near the end she left a bigger impact on me then the rest.
After thinking about the rest, a series of characters that seem bland and simplistic in the way they are, the only other character worth mentioning is Inosuke. He's a violent and delusional demon slayer who will change his stance immediately to save face. I feel like he is only there to make up for Tanjirou's lack of growth and boldness. That's not to say that Tanjiro doesn't take risks. Still, Tanjiro is so naively compassionate and sympathetic he should have died a thousand times by now. Inosuke feels like he was only written into the story to counter Tanjiro' personality and to keep the audience from feeling annoyed by Tanjiro by adding this brainless, violent protagonist to make up for it.
The antagonists, or the demons, are not just mindless enemies in the series. They are written in a way to give them humanity out of their tragic backstories. It feels as if Jun Maeda was hired to write everyone's backstories because it seems nearly everyone has a sob story in this anime that glosses over the lack of depth in their character. I believe hardly anyone has strong writing behind them. As a result, the series plays on the viewer's emotions with the repetitive formula of constantly throwing rushed sob stories in your face to force you to care about characters every single time. Mopey backstories aside, there is nothing really meaningful about most characters that compels me to really care about them. Despite that, Tanjiro is often used along with this formula to make you care about meaningless characters because he feels bad for them. As a high moral figure, the viewers of course will sympathize with him.
The biggest issue I have with Demon Slayer is that it feels as if the entire first season relied on the back of one episode. Those who watched it know which one I mean. Leading up to it, the series felt mediocre, dragged on with the same genetic formula of fighting new demons constantly, and held up by amazing animation. All it does is help build up for that great episode. It doesn't show any real character development besides Zenitsu, as Tanjirou gets none in this season, implied by the name of the arc leading into the movie. Again, this series plays on the viewers emotions. The bond between Tanjirou and Nezuko is the only meaningful part of the series that explodes with strong emotions once they decide to unfold that mighty episode I mentioned. After that, it just goes downhill again to set up for the next arc.
Amazing animation aside, some episodes, like the second last one, just feel terrible and bland when not on the backs of amazing production values. Just as with the music, the story can feel undeserving of these production values. The writing can't carry itself when the animation decides to cool down and it shows.
This all leads me to Tanjirou. I can feel for the boy for being a character that feels almost like a holy figure in the kind and compassionate way he is. However, rather than being a great protagonist of amazing growth and writing, he comes of more like a basic hero for a 10 year old to relate to and aspire to be. He grows nothing in these 26 episodes. I can understand his merciful attitude towards demons, but he still feels too simplistic and cliche a character. Still, that doesn't mean I have fully given up on him.
It doesn't help that the fights feel ridiculous at times. What was the point of characters breaking bones if they still fight almost as if nothing happened? At least they tried to make the fights interesting as the cast try to outsmart the demons.
When the series decides to turn up it's action, it can do a great a job. During the best fight in the series, it felt like an emotional rollercoaster to go through. Sadly, many times it just feels like a hollow type of enjoyment. It's as if the staff is trying to show the viewers that it can animate something amazingly rather than to hold up a great story behind it a lot of the time.
Speaking of animation, the character designs can look very beautiful. Despite that, the originality can be poor as many of the characters, men and women, can look too much the same. I'm not sure what the deal is with Kyoujurou yet, but his stare looks horrifying to look at with how creepy his eyes look.
Kibutsuji is the main antagonist. He's done too little for me to care about him besides him causing trouble and mindlessly killing everything around him, friend or foe. I'm sure eventually the viewers will get some predictably sad sob story about him at some point regardless.
After the fact, Demon Slayer did nothing amazing for me except for that one beautiful episode. Other than that, perhaps studio Ufotable should have picked a better source material to grace with their animation.",7,Spirit_Chaser

                I mean... I get the hype. The only reason I find it worth it, however, is that I love that the female characters are written pretty decently in this show. My problem with most action anime is that the female characters are either weak and cute or powerful tsunderes. I'm glad to see there are many opportunities for both powerful and cute characters in this show. I enjoyed that for starters; that aside, the show itself is just good. I like that it has that kind of sad background (main character loses his family) but it doesn't drag it on for 200+ episodes (looking at
                  you, Naruto), and that there isn't some main female character ecked out for the main male character just because (which is probably why female anime characters disappoint me, because they're there as the main protagonist's love interest, not as their own character). The main female character of DS is his sister so obviously no romance happening there.",9,halimede

Story writing is poor, characters are honestly pretty uninteresting (Dont say its not like that you know it deep inside and I know it too) it was more like a comedy anime that tried to be a serious story anime and somehow it got people into it though mostly weeblets. This anime was blessed by inflated fame, it got much more fame and hype than it deserved by far.
I personally saw many animes with much less overall score in here that
                  did better in every aspect of quality. What mostly disappointed me was honestly the at best a very mediocre story writing and thats only when I turn a blind eye and im trying to be nice about it.",3,Empress_Auri

Out of 100 Nobles watching…

5 were dissatisfied with story progression
5 wanted more substance in fights than smell-ex-machina
Heeeeeeyyyyyy Demon Slayer is the new hotness in Shonen anime having just wrapped up its first meaty 26-episode course with a movie promised on the way. Make no mistake I have a lot of gripes to make about Demon Slayer, but all in all this show was pretty good and definitely something you can watch and talk with anyone about no matter their level of Otaku. 
First off, I’ll lay out all the positives.
                  Kimestu no Yaiba has a pretty strong start and for it’s first half of the season absolutely rockets out the gate with its pacing. The first 10 episodes fly by driven by the very strong motivations of the main character Tanjiro. He must hunt down the demons who slew his family and cure his sister who has become one herself. A simple revenge plot with no extra bells and whistles was very refreshing to see. When the show goes ham on the stylization and action sequences it goes all out. I was really impressed and appropriately hyped at key moments greatly flourished by the show’s inky art style.
The initial fast pacing was very promising and I think it’s a bit tragic that we got such a good taste of it before the show really starts to grind. Later episodes introducing supplementary characters one of which *cough* Zenitsu *cough* making some episodes almost unwatchably annoying, but they more or less balance out with the other characters. Heck, I’d be lying if I didn’t enjoy Zenitsu’s attitude just a little bit. I digress, in short, the show slows down considerably giving some villains almost half episodes worth of character depth POST MORTEM. I liked the tragic backstories of the demons as it’s congruent with many Oni in Japanese mythology, however things were a tad too slow I felt. 
Sound design was overall serviceable. I really liked the OP and ED. They felt very early 2000’s era anime and gave me good vibes coming and going out of each episode. The show had some really good tunes with Japanese instruments and some playful tunes that brought Okami to mind often, but I felt a significant amount of forced hype in the full orchestra blasting horns in your ears in literally every scene with the slightest amount of tension. Luckily the 3-4 relevant plot changing scenes of the show that needed the proper music got it. 
I think where Demon Slayer really stumbled was in conflicts outside of those defining moment scenes. Many fights against less important foes and every fight for the sub cast was riddled with low quality CG slapped on the foregrounds of shots. CG isn’t inherently a bad thing especially when kept to backgrounds. The CG crowds, snow, and buildings weren’t too offensive but when mixed in with shots of drawn characters a model moving 25 frames per second really looks uncanny. It was very apparent that the studio was aware they were making a long running series and didn’t have the backing of Boku no Hero so they had to blow the budget on the important bits. This hampered a good number of less important but still fairly relevant scenes. How am I supposed to be horrified or think “oh man this is what’s going dooooown” when all I can stare at is a pool of gross Playstation 2 blood?
Character designs were pretty good ranging from quality badass to One Piece stupid. Luckily, we’re sitting in the mostly good range. I did find it hilarious at one point the show itself addresses only relevant to plot characters having distinct designs in its own in-universe way. 
There you have it. The biggest Shonen on the block until Hero Aca comes back in a matter of days. Allegedly the Kimetsu no Yaiba manga is in it’s “last arc” as of February this year which should serve as a motivation to keep up with the show. You can rest assured you’re investing in something that at least will have a conclusion which can’t be said for a lot of shows. 
Show was pretty good despite some sizeable flaws. Lot’s of qt3.14 violence so if that’s a trigger than stay away. I didn’t like that part for sure.

                What a good show, it’s not the best, but it’s definitely good. The animation when needed is flawless and the music is especially well done. I enjoy the setting and most of the characters, but you can’t beat these fight scenes. 
Story – 7
I like it; it’s got an interesting universe and very intense premise. The demons all have back stories and it’s all very interesting to watch. It can be shallow some times and rely on some cliché characters, but it’s fun overall.
Art – 8
I’m only giving it an 8 because of the really obvious CGI that appears frequently. It appears too often and
                  really shouldn’t be used during fight scenes. Aside from that the art is amazing; I love the style and cinematography of the fights. Especially how the water and fire flow around the fight. The characters designs are amazing as well, all very distinct and to the point. 
Sound – 9
I love the music, background music and sound effects in this series. the OP and ED are good, especially the ED in episode 19, it plays so well into the episode. They fit the time period perfectly and help convey fights and feelings.
Characters – 7
They mostly are pretty bland, with cardboard cut-out personality. Be it the main character being a goodie two shoes.
Tanjiro is the main character and as I said he’s a goodie two shoes, but at least he has a reason to be.
Nezuko is way over hyped, yeah she had some good scenes, but she appears way too little.
Tanjiro is very annoying, but has some very fun moments and great fights.
Inosuke is possibly my favourite character, being completely mentally insane for the entire series.
Overall – 8
It is very good, I can’t deny it. I enjoyed it, especially the fight scene in episode 19. There are some bad moments, but its fine with the overflow of good.",8,Anime_is_average

                Demon Slayer is an anime with class. It exhibits an authentic anime feeling. Most animes these days forget to do that. Demon Slayer is very precious to me as it was the anime that got me into watching countless more animes. This anime is known for its animation and art style it is undoubtedly one of the best animes showcasing these features. Even though the story is very basic, a boy trying to find a cure for her demon sister, the anime makes it up with the animation and well-directed fights. Demon Slayer presents exceptional fight scenes, with my favorite fight being Rui vs Tanjiro.

                I would characterize this anime as somewhere between Naruto and Hunter x Hunter. It's got your typical shounen main character who has a tragic backstory but is an earnest and honest hardworking fellow. In battle, he recalls his training and through will and determination surpasses his limits! However, it's darker then Naruto and it's too early to see if the good guys have plot armor. The show does a fantastic job of making fights super hype. Not only that, they are pretty clever and they give us an inner dialogue of the fighters and their strategies. The animation for the techniques is very cool and
                  unique. Overall, I think this anime has the most potential of any anime I've seen for a really long time. I think this could potentially be remembered as one of the greats by the end of it.",9,IanBac

                Many people who love Demon Slayer might disagree with my opinions on this show. So please don't interpret my review the wrong way. I liked this show, and I enjoyed it, but Kimetsu No Yaiba's story is lacking to some extent. It's quite obvious at some points that the animation of this show is some what carrying it's 8 rating.
Kimetsu No Yaiba has a pretty well thought out story line, but I do believe there is a large gap between it's repetitiveness and introducing new story line. In the show the main character Tanjiro is looking for a cure to his demon sister (same as
                  the manga). But every single journey seems the same, In my opinion, I was just waiting for more great animation. That's the problem to me. I was more hyped to see the animation in this show, then wondering what was going to happen next in the story line. I watched the anime then read the manga, so that's not why I thought like that.
Something I loved about this show in the beginning was that main character Tanjiro, he was the hard working shonen. But the more and more the show went on, Tanjiro tended to just repeat the same lines over and over again. ""I have to save Nezuko!, I will turn her back to human"". That line got damn annoying at some point. Like it's okay to restate his purpose, but damn it was cringe worthy at some points. This might just be the sub, not sure.
A lot of people enjoy comedy anime, and that's fine. But Kimetsu no Yaiba is not on the basis of a comedy. This kid's family was killed, and his little sister was turned to a demon. You watch these actions unfold as the show goes on. But then they introduce Zenitsu, who is an okay character. He's basically just a little pussy, but when he passes out during a fight he becomes godlike. Anyway, this character got mad annoying, and in my opinion failed to implement comic relief the correct way. Zenitsu does nothing but scream the whole show. The voice acting in general just gets annoying, there's just so much damn whining. Like I thought I was watching an intense demon show?
Otherwise I love the determination of the main character, and the way the plot develops Tanjiro. I love the music in the show, it's creepy and motivating at the same time. I love the animation (obviously), it's so great, my favorite part of the show. The sounds are great, they match the animation well. I enjoyed seeing the different characters, more interested in the cool enemies and Zenitsu's thunder breathing.
Overall this show is good, but it's not great. If you want me to be honest, demon slayer would not make it as a ""good"" anime, if it wasn't for the anime.",7,FarProxi

                Number of Episodes: 26 + a movie (about 20 minutes each) I have no intentions of watching season 2
Plot: C+ *The plot was never the selling point of the show, but it was good enough at the start. After coming home to find that his entire family had been butchered by demons, Kamado Tanjirô finds his little sister and realizes that she has been turned into a demon as well. But instead of killing her, he neuters her and trains to become a Demon Slayer in the hopes of being able to transform her back into her human form. The first half of the show
                  starts off strong introducing us to the rigorous training cycle of Demon Slayers and slowly getting us introduced to where demons came from and how they operate in society. But after about the halfway point, the show becomes very tropey and loses what made it so interesting in the first place. And because of that, I have no interest in continuing the show.
Visuals: A *The main selling point of the show. The animation is beautiful and the fight sequences have some of the best animation put to film. Plus Nezuko has an adorable design which has made her into a fan favorite and a cultural icon.
Voice Acting: D *I dislike the voice acting in the dub, but stuck with it because I hate the sub so much more. I can't believe how bad Tanjiro's blood-curling screams are. It is probably the worst scream I have ever heard in a show. And that doesn't even include the horrific voices of Zenitsu and Inosuke who were easily the worst additions to the show and led to its downfall.
Film Score/Soundtrack B *The music from the show was always a high point. The upbeat electronic songs, epic orchestral songs that have a sort of Chinese feel to them with the tribal chanting make the songs memorable and powerful at moments.
Characters: D *The funny thing is, my rating for the characters is much higher if it was the first half of the series when it doesn't include Zenitsu and Inosuke. It felt like the story was moving forward with Tanjiro learning how to be a Demon Slayer. Nezuko doesn't have any dialogue but she was finally starting to wake up more and seemed to be growing in power. We were introduced to interesting trainers and mentors and an intriguing antagonist in Muzan Kibutsuji. But then the second half of the series happened and then the movie. And that's where everything went downhill. Inosuke is your token warrior that loves to kill, is a spazz 24/7 and gets into trouble but because he is so obnoxious, he is funny because he is inappropriate with his tendencies of wanting to rush into things without thinking. Oh and he wears a boar head because he looks beautiful underneath and he doesn't want anyone to know that because he's got some sort of weird little-man complex. Then we have Zenitsu who is the biggest scaredy-cat that is useless and simps hardcore for Nezuko. He is like a combination of the worst attributes of Usopp and Sanji from One Piece. But whenever he falls asleep, he becomes one of the most powerful characters in the entire show and kicks ass which pretty much serves as a crutch for the writers to use whenever everything seems lost. And then they introduced us to the Hashira which are
Cringeworthy Anime Moments: In the first half of the series, the talking during the fighting wasn't so bad. But it progressively got worse and worse as the show went on and by the movie, they can't even make an attack without announcing what form and type it is. It's so irritating!
Titles:
Opening *Kind of makes me think of Fullmetal Alchemist. A catchy and fast-paced intro.
Closing Titles *Ok this song is awesome! It's hard to be upset at an episode when a song this good plays at the end. The opening bells, the build-up, the beautifully sung lyrics, and then that haunting chant at the very end with the strings closing the song off?... I love this outro!
Final Verdict: 4/10[/b[ *It's impressive how far this show went downhill for me. I started off looking forward to each episode, and then by the end, I was literally skipping fight scenes and every Zenitsu and Inosuke moment that happened. I went to see the Demon Slayer Movie in theaters in the hopes that it would get on the right track (pun fully intended), but sadly, it went even further off the rails than I anticipated it getting. I hated what happened to the show and it honestly disappoints me that so many people are enjoying it so much. Don't get me wrong, I am in the minority and everyone is welcome to like and dislike what they want to. I just wish Demon Slayer stayed the course like its first half instead of becoming what it did. It makes for good long-running Shonen anime which kids will enjoy and will make lots of money. But the story became insufferable for me and I couldn't handle it anymore.",4,Lab_Mem_Num001

                The newest shounen cash cow snoozefest with nothing new or interesting to offer. There are a couple of silver linings to this show. The show looks good, the animations are fluid and solid, and I think the artists did a great job with the use of color here. Also whoever voiced purple butterfly lady did a fantastic job and deserves a raise. The main character Tanjiro in particular has a great *visual character design and stands out from the typical shounen protagonist. And that's about it.
It's almost hilarious how poorly written this show is, from its generic plot to its unbearable cardboard characters.  The
                  plot is that Tanjiro comes back one day to find his family slaughtered(this was a huge LMAO moment but we will get back to the family in more detail shortly). The only person left alive was nezuko who was now a demon. They then go on this adventure to try and convert nezuko back by joining the demon slayers and they go and hunt demons. The premise of this show isn’t awful by any means, but the way it's executed really leaves a lot to desire. I wanted more out of the whole nezuko being a demon thing, but she's just there for being cute and fanservice stuff and whatnot and also for plot points. The rest of the characters in the show are generic one descriptor anime tropes with no depth to them. Inozuke is aggressive. Bowl head is a crybaby and I guess also a pervert(that makes two words!). Inozuke and bowlhead are the side-kicks to the protagonist. They are really annoying and serve no purpose to the plot other than for our shonen to have friends. Teacher man is wise. Tanjiro is a shounen protagonist. They try to make us feel bad for Tanjiro because his family died but the family is so cardboard it's hard to not cringe. Literally no build up or any forms of characterization to any of them. 
This moment in the show brings up a sort of larger writer's issue in fiction nowadays. I have a strong feeling that the writers meant for the family death to be shocking. We were supposed to feel sympathetic and yet with the way it was executed, I ended up laughing. First and foremost, the audience experiences loss and grief (not for just death per se) when we see that something is missing that was specific and important to the characters. This is why I roll my eyes at end of the world sequences because the end of the world is not specific enough for me to care. Ok, so tanjiros family was important to him, however we don’t know enough about tanjiro or the family enough to care 2 minutes into the first episode. Nor was the method of death more than just generic “slaughtering”. Not to mention that the family was so generic it was painful to watch any sequences with them in it. Seriously, I heard from the little sister, “I want to be like onee chan when I grow up.” God the dialogue is bad.  Cardboard picture family gets slaughtered because plot.
Other than that, the show doesn’t have a scale problem(yet), however the rest is what you would expect from one of these cash cow shonen shows.  Randomly computer generated character designs for groups of enemies and groups of generic heroes. No sense of “show, dont tell”. Flat humor. Battles that take too long(and really unimpressive ones at that) where enemies and allies alike blurt their strategies aloud to each other and there is too much internal monologuing. Predictable plot points. False senses of danger. 
If you like pretty animation’s and shounen anime(if you liked hunter x hunter, mha, one piece) and have no problems with the anime tropes and one dimensional characters, and you use substances, and or possess the ability to turn your brain off, then this one's for you.

                I've been suffering through this until episode 14. Now I'm giving up. 
This show is 75% of long winded fight scenes, 20% unfunny humour where the characters are just screaming out loud, and lastly it's 5% story progression. If that much. 
Needless to say, this show is boring as hell, and I probably only kept going as long as I did because the episodes usually end on a cliffhanger. 
It's got good art, and a good intro by LiSA. That's pretty much it. 
I feel like I could probably edit the first 14 episodes down to an hour without loosing anything of significance.

                  I did, it might be worth watching.",4,entropicchaos

                Is Demon Slayer a masterpiece filled with tons of great themes, characters, and plots? No. However, it is still very entertaining. Demon slayer's plot is a cool one, though somewhat predictable and basic. The characters have mediocre progression at times, the show and fights can be formulaic, and some parts feel dragged on a bit. However, I believe the sheer beauty of the fighting and animation makes the show a fantastic one. Episode 19 ending gives me goosebumps every time I watch it, the score and editing in this show is truly fantastic. The movie and Entertainment District Arc really surprised me, and took away
                  some of the negatives or doubts I felt watching this show. At the end of the day, I believe once Demon Slayer is complete, it will go down as an all time great shonen anime. The beauty of the fights and animation, along with likeable characters and the journey we see Tanjiro go on to defeat the 12 kizuki and Muzan truly is one that I can't stop sinking my teeth into, despite the show's downsides such as character developments and iffy plot. Sometimes, deep themes and intricate show developments truly can be looked past to appreciate animation, score, and plot.",9,Pufferfishhh

                i have to praise the studio for adapting this series beautifully.
it's a typical classic shounen that really neat.
i saw it in every top watch list and curious, i didn't realize it's in the shounen jump gang series
story: 8
i am a fan of neat writing.
like any other typical shounen formula, yeah it's the very classic fighting-training stuff, with some organization/group of justice related, the setting's pretty interesting, a bunch of swordsman fighting demons that actually normal human with no 'super-duper-power'. i love how the author develops the superpower with sense, like breathing, however, it is still very classic that in someway makes me think:
""ah man I
                  watch a bunch of this kind of stuff.. i'm tired""
BUT the special trait that i want to praise is it is done so neat, it's not just a senseless brawl fight, there's some kind of special setting in each battle that makes it all worth watching, tanjiro, use his intelligence with his limited capability. tho it's a bit lacking in the element of surprises, it is still fun to watch
art: 10. outstanding, indeed
i love historical visual elements, the beauty of classic Japanese art style, the visual effect, flowers, Hokusai's classic waves. beautiful, amazing. the visual makes all the scenes perfectly. the animation and camera work did it right.
well i just can't deny the artwork is perfect, the cultural ambiance is just too beautiful, perhaps that makes this series so popular
sound: 9
seiyuu done it right! i always think that all of seiyuus is talented. some of the series hire a popular seiyuu but the directing might be bad and they ended sounds flat, but the directing is great they sound awesome
not to mention the ost, i always love ost with classical Japanese instrument and it fits perfectly
character: 8
yes, it's generic, but it gives this kinda fresh feeling, it's typical but quirky, 
but the hero, tanjiro is the kind of character I can't understand, it's too good to be true that such a kind human-being exist, he fit a hero character perfectly, but, his kindness just.. well it's fictional so it's not a big deal
and for a shounen battle series, somehow the character design is.. hmm too cute(?) it's a bit lacking on macho-ism or strong element on the protagonist or supporting characters, but it doesn't matter, there's still room for development. but i could understand that the author creates them with great care, even the antagonist, they have their own purpose, struggles, and history.
overall: 8
i enjoy it so much i can watch it over and over again. because it's beautiful, the artwork really did a great job. well yea, people would think this is overrated, but it's worth watching",8,sogegesoge

                Demon Slayer has a lot of cliché shonen elements. While the animation is undoubtedly fantastic, the actual story is rather uninteresting. 
We follow the adventures of Tanjiro who despite losing his entire family to demons, can barely muster the courage to kill one himself. Part of this empathy toward demons can be attributed to his sister herself is a demon, but where is Tanjiro's obligation toward the welfare of humanity? Whlie his actions could be seen as heroic and courageous for trying to understand the demons who have been unfairly turned to monsters by Muzan, its rather annoying that Tanjiro must first befriend his enemies
                  before he can even start his attempt at killing them.
There are many other shonen cliches, such as the Hashiras and many of the character personalities. Moreover, it is overshadowed by other shonens because of its predictability. There aren't many twists or mysteries associated with the Demon Slayer world that are engaging as you would see in other shonens, which leaves it rather mediocre.",6,abrahamalan2

""Demon Slayer would be mid without ufotable""
A common take that many people like to take on this show but how valid is it exactly. We'll find out in my review of season 1...
Despite the non-existent world building, lacklustre plot, one-dimensional characters, poor execution of power system and amazing animation Demon Slayer ultimately works as a starter anime but does not work in terms of the overall substance it offers as whole. I'm happy for ufotable for the great success they made upon this show.
Story Influence 1: The story of the show is based on a classical retelling on the Oni-vampire
                  tale in Japanese folk books. Your loved one(which is the sister in this show) loses their humanity and you have to go on this classical journey to go and find a cure to get their humanity back. 
this is nothing new...
Story Influence 2: Although what is so unique about the actual show is it's set in the Taisho Period Of Japan in 1920 and the breathing techniques(even though they look like a rip-off of Hamon Breathing in JoJo).
Story Review: In the very first episode I already predicted that his family is going to die. This show speed run it's beginning, if this is the main charge of the show then that was already a poor start already. Take your time, let's get to know how much your family loves you and what they mean to you, not just see them as stupid-ass flashbacks that do not sort of correlate to the theme of fighting (looking at you Season 2). 
After 3 episodes, the main character Tanjiro sways a sword for 2 years in order to slice a boulder then across the next 17 episodes and more he pulls 10 so-called water techniques out of his ass. What are the name of all 10 water breathing techniques again? And did he learn them in the 2 years? At least show us he did them for god sake and not just have him go through 2 years in 1.5 episodes WTF. Although the animation of the water breathing were really satisfying as I was in awe of every one of them. 
Now then Tanjiro became a demon slayer after episode 5 and was introduced to the demon slayer ranks. This is the power system of the show. What I like about the show is it's simplicity and how it's easy to understand certain things especially the power system. There are ten ranks in total. You need to slay hundreds and hundreds of demons to reach to the highest rank and then if you are properly prepared you can face a Lower Moon (Lower Moon 6 is a reasonable start). He does do this along with the help of his sister Nezuko but they only face around 4 demons or so. The drum demon used to be a lower moon 6 so Tanjiro is given a pass from me for not skipping strength developments. I must say the 3D Choreography in the drum house was really good too. This episode occurs around episodes 13 and 14.
This is also introduces the next two main characters of the trio and OH GAWD...
Main Cast: When I saw the introduction of these I cringed so hard. Zenitsu the Thunder Demon Slayer is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen. My guy thunderclaps all over the place based on one move. Do not master all techniques but master just one techniques a 1000 times. Nah I'm not buying that shit. Go back to your grandpa and please learn the other moves(in the manga he goes from first to seventh form wtf?) Inosuke the Beast Demon Slayer, whilst he does show a more outgoing personality out of the main trio is too loud. Inosuke was never trained by anyone but instead trained himself since he apparently know about the breathing techniques .Brother was raised by boars and he was also the fastest to finish the Demon Slayer Exam since he lived in the Mountains?
HOW DID ANYONE NOT PICK THIS UP?
Main Cast: Both of their dialogues and Tanjiro's are pretty one-dimensional. Though what stands out about Tanjiro especially when compared to other main protagonists in the shonen demographic is his kindness and respect for the demons. Dude is so special that by coincidence and his god-like smell saw the main villain of the show in episode 7. But guess what Tanjro? You don't know how much the demons been throughout in their lives? You don't know the amount of innocent families they have killed? Your sympathy won't do shit to them. They are going to hell anyways. Man what is this stupid Mary Sue BS! His sister Nezuko does not really have that much of a character and personality. She is told by Tanjiro that humans are good and demons are bad. Yep that's it. She's not the only good demon, there is also a doctor demon and her assistant but I don't really care about them since they are not build throughout the show. Most characters in this show are somewhat one-dimensional. That's pretty underwhelming for a highly praised show such as this one based on it's characters. 
Animation Praise: Props to the colourful characters designs, the arts and aesthetics in this show.
Japanese Rock Music: The music score in this show is really good. Made by arguably the best singer in japan currently known as Lisa. Though Gurenge is great I enjoyed the end sequence song called From The Edge too. Both do stick within the themes of this show so that's what great about it.
Infamous Episode: The penultimate part of the show is of course the main reason as to why this shonen became so astronomically hyped up due to Ufotable's Unlimited Budget Works Method. In Episode 19 Tanjiro receives a mirror image of all his moments in the last 18 episodes. What moments? It's just panels of certain scenes that combine to make up an image. Nothing special has happened so why bother. He then gets a flashback of his dad, Where was his dad introduced all now? Apparently his father did a 'dance of the fire god' dance to implement the Sun Breathing Technique. I never cared about a sun breathing technique before. Then out of nowhere Tanjiro turns into some Last Airbender Wannabe and turns water breathing into Sun breathing surprising the demon he is facing, Lower Moon Five, then somehow his sister says buckets and shows a Blood Demon Art as well. She is a special demon too? Then the villain cuts his own head off with some Deus Ex Machina shit and the episodes end with cut corners of Tanjiro's Family.
Power System: But we did get the understanding of how to slay a Lower Moon as in episode 20 a Hashira ( which is a name given to the strongest demon slayer in current existence) is able to slay the Lowe Moon with ease. So it takes at least 1 Hashira to slay a Lower Moon. From what I've read in the manga it takes at least 3 Hashiras to slay an Upper Moon which are the representation of the strongest six demons to ever exist in the current climate of the show.
Overall: I mean the animation was amazing I'll give it that but uh... nothing crazy happened overall. I need to understand more about this technique he pulled of his ass first and then vice versa. The show is moving too fast and skips pathways in characters writing.
It does do the execution of some tropes pretty well in a solid mindset but does not make up for the lacklustre plot and subpar writing. The characters in this show whilst all likeable are stupidly standard in the shonen genre. Funny most of them don't really develop at all in the story from reading the manga.
it's a very enjoyable show at the end of the day, not a mid show just a decent one.

                Kimetsu no yaiba is a very special anime. You may go into it thinking it is just another shonen with the same simple story as all the others such as naruto, black clover, my hero, etc. But it is a lot more. It is already well known by the majority of people that have at least heard of the anime that the art is incredible. Episode 19 is a good example of this, but it is not the only example. Every single fight in the entire show is like this. The show makes incredible use of the dynamic camera and CGI. the smooth and colorful
                  fights, and satisfying attacks that give you orgasms just looking at them are some things that make the art amazing.  But its animation is not the only thing that makes it so great. The story is simple, yes. It's about a boy whose family is killed by demons and his sister is turned into one, and when he finds out about demon slayers he vows to become the best of the bes- no. That's not how it goes. Unlike typical shonen, the motivations of the main character are completely selfless. He cares not for his own future and well-being. His main ""Never give up moments"" as I like to call them are never from ambitions of wanting to become strong and popular. All he wants is to become strong ***enough*** to be able to protect his sister until he can find a way to turn her human. But the even better thing about this is the fact that he's not OVERLY selfless or kind like other shonen characters. He feels pity for the demons, but he still doesn't show mercy because he knows what they did is unforgivable. The only time he has ever shown mercy is when he kills a demon in an extremely peaceful and calm way because the demon had a bad life not only as a human but also as a demon. But even then he still takes into account that she has taken innocent lives, and kills her. Even if he gives her a painless death, he still kills her. And that's what matters. Zenitsu is extremely annoying. He is extremely scared about everything, and cannot fight unless he switches his personality or whatever he does. But honestly, him being extremely pitiful and weak makes his badass moments feel even more satisfying and... you know... badass than they would if he was just always a badass. As of yet in the anime, we don't really know a lot about inosuke. All we know is he has a pretty face, but he grew up in the mountains because his mother was forced to abandon him.  He seems like what would be the typical shonen main protagonist. He's dumb, aspires to be great, treats everyone as a rival, has a huge ego (which makes you feel bad for him even more when his ego gets crushed), and has selfish goals. But the good part is the fact that he isnt the main character. Honestly it feels like the author is just teasing us at this point with the fact that they actually made a likable main protagonist with tanjiro, and they bring a clone of naruto with a hint of vegeta just to tell us "" yes, i already know this is what tanjiro would've been if i wasn't so amazing."". thats about all I've got to say for now. Its an incredible anime and you should definitely watch it if you haven't already.",8,Jakoby2363

                This anime is very nice! moreover ufotable makes this anime to be of high quality and has very good graphics and animations. the storyline is also very good and each character has different but complementary characteristics. 
The main characters in this anime have different characters. Tanjirou has an innocent and honest character, Zenitsu is actually strong, but is not confident in his strength and likes to cry. Inosuke who is stubborn and likes to fight. Nezuko who is a demon but also a demon hunter. the plot is also light and simple, but not easy to guess. I like the story line is not too
                  heavy. treated to battle scenes and comedy that makes the audience not feel bored. visual animation in each battle makes the eyes of each audience stay focused in every movement.
And I also like the opening song of this anime 'gurenge'. The backsound also fits perfectly with the scene, especially the backsound of 'Kamado Tanjirou no uta' in episode 19. yea, episode 19 is the best of all episodes in this anime. This episode proves the seriousness and hard work of Ufotable to make this anime a very high quality animation. And I like that. indeed the whole of each episode is good, but the peak of the quality of animation and graphics, as well as its epicness is in episode 19.
Although in my opinion the storyline is 'mainstream', where the main character will 'get stronger-practice-against demon-rest-against demon again', but the story is still interesting and exciting to follow, with stunning graphic support. a variety of interesting protagonist and antagonist characters, strong enemies and amazing sword arts make this anime a 'different', with a traditional Japanese feel.
The added value of this anime is the good graphic quality and the smooth graphics. the stories and battles in each episode are interesting to see with stunning visual effects. I think fans of the action genre anime should watch this anime! the action element is there, the comedy is there. I always look forward to the rest of the story, both the movie and the next season. I am very fond of this anime. I even aligned this anime with Naruto, which is my number one favorite anime.
This anime is one of my favorite anime.

                Kimetsu no Yaiba
Demon Slayer
The manga was completely foreign to me and I have never heard a single word about it. It's hard to believe that something like this was hiding somewhere. I was of the opinion that there would be no more usable shounen and that’s where the title comes from.
With Kimetsu no Yaiba, Studio Ufatable has unearthed something interesting.
Unfortunately, it is an absolute fact that Demon Slayer has 0 character depth, development, and stroy. In that area he is extremely blunt.
-
The actual main story doesn't seem to be very interesting, it meets the Shounen standards. Just like the process, there is little individuality and you can see a lot of familiar things again. What impresses me positively here is the implementation of these monotonous scenes. This is exactly how it has to be done, insofar as enough creativity is added, a typical process can also be very refreshing and new.
Among other things, this work also has an enormous number of stereo type characters and personalities that would normally not even be worth mentioning. However, there are surprises here as well.
You have the typical nice protagonist, a daredevil, scaredy rabbit and a girl with a few Moe scenes and who seems a bit Kudere. Sounds like an interesting bunch, doesn't.
But the actual result is different again. The scaredy rabbit has actually been designed so exaggerated that the whole thing is almost amusing. The implementation of his paranoid delusion of killing him is almost wonderful. The daredevil is actually an endearing and chaotic male version of a charming tsundere. The Kudere sister is ... with a little more screen time I almost noticed her in the anime, but there is nothing unpleasant about it.
And the best thing is the protagonist. The 0815 personification of niceness. He is not a hypocrite, he is logical, has a number of understandable approaches and justifies his actions in such a way that even the viewer understands it. There are a number of protagonists of his kind, but he is probably the first to actually implement it. He is nice, but does not hesitate to fight and kill. However, he never forgets his human side and grace is no stranger to him. Especially since he seems to be above average intelligent, which reminds me of Midoriya (My Hero Academia).
Given this, I like it. a bit difficult to rate the characters. They definitely collect sympathy points. However, there is a lack of detail.
What I also have to say are the opponents. It is very impressive what background stories have been inserted, so it is up to the viewer to decide whether to mourn them or feel dislike.
In the first season, you didn't see much of the plot, although it supposedly already covered a lot of the manga. Nonetheless, what you see is entertaining enough. But if you wait for some plot to show up at the end, forget it. There is none.
Not to mention the remarkable animations and beautiful displays. The music shows itself here at its finest. As far as optics are concerned, there is nothing to complain about here.
It is definitely one of those works that I have enjoyed enormously and will be remembered very positively, despite its flaws.",5,Resting_Bonfire

                I'm gonna make this short. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba is IMO a lil overrated. The show is a good 7/10 which isn't bad I'm just saying it's not a masterpiece. The animation goes without saying is super amazing and definitely one of the best in terms of animation, but that's only a small part of what makes a show good. The story is well pretty basic, now don't get me wrong it's a shonen anime/manga, not all the time but most it's not the best story out there but most of the time it's never terrible. Demon Slayer is a part of the good
                  shonen shows. I won't say anything about the story but for a anime like this it's pretty short and it's just a cool show I guess. I do like the combat/idea of the sword styles and the stuff like that I just dig it.

                This review is spoiler-free!
One of the most popular series at the moment! After taking a break from watching anime, I grew really curious about what Kimetsu no Yaiba had to offer. Many of my friends recommended it to me, so I finally gave in and watched it. Let's talk about my thoughts~
Remember, people are allowed to like or dislike whatever they want. This review is mostly for myself to collect my thoughts.
__
STORY:
Unlike a lot of the shows I've watched, Kimetsu no Yaiba focuses heavily on the bond between family. I find that theme very refreshing, given its clear position in the spotlight. Other than that,
                  it follows a very typical shounen plot line, though perhaps a bit fast-paced. For example, every enemy's backstory is thrown in your face after the battle, making it a bit predictable and boring later on. The fights are also not bad, and I loved the fights leading up to and during episode 19. If you haven't watched, you should anticipate it! Even though it's not very unique, the story is still enjoyable. Keep in mind, Kimetsu no Yaiba it's a very standard shounen. You shouldn't expect too much from it, or else you'll ruin the experience.
ART:
The show's art focuses a lot on making important elements (ie. characters) pop out. Backgrounds are always full of earth tones, to bring out the colourful characters. I really liked the use of thicker lines around the characters, too. It really gives the style a signature touch. In Kimetsu no Yaiba, attacks include unique visuals. I really liked the water attack animations, the traditional-based art style of the waves and the smooth movement were beautiful. The only issue I had was the constant usage of 3D models. It's a personal preference, but I dislike the switches between 2D and 3D animation in anime. Overall, there's nothing really extravagant about the art, but the series has definitely made a distinct image of itself.
SOUNDTRACK (OP/ED, OST):
Gurenge is a wonderful song, LiSA's voice always amazes me. The lyrics of the song, the power vocals, and the energy in the chorus suit the series well. It really gets you hyped for the episode which is perfect for this kind of show. The ending is also nice, I think the highlight for me is the guitar. Since the intro of the song is softer, it doesn't really prompt the viewer to continue listening (in other words, it's very skippable). The OST is average. I can't recall any tracks that stood out to me, and most of them use the same traditional sounds which can make them difficult to differentiate. On the other hand, no tracks stood out for being bad either. I'm pretty opinion-less on it.
CHARACTERS:
From the anime, I don't really see much reason to get attached to any characters. None of them really have depth, or the depth they're given feels very forced (flashbacks right before deaths, etc). The appeal of the characters seems to be more from their surface level personality traits. Take for example Nezuko, who has become extremely popular in the anime community since the show's release. Most of the time, she is shown to be a cute, loyal, affectionate but quiet girl. Without a clear backstory, she lacks any sort of depth and we are left with a few adjectives that we can either like or dislike. This goes for pretty much every other character in the series. My favourite character was probably Rui, who's backstory directly connected to his current character's actions (making it seem less forced, like the information was actually important to know). We also get to see him overcome the traumas of his past. For Kimetsu no Yaiba, it's really up to the audience to create depth for the personalities on screen.
ENJOYMENT:
I did enjoy watching this anime, but I don't really understand the massive hype around it. Yes, it's good but there's nothing necessarily unique about it that sets it apart from other shounen anime. If you're looking for a show to fill your time up, this is the perfect one to do it. It has enough of a story to keep you entertained (I did find the ending pretty disappointing and anti-climatic, though), and the characters are relatively endearing despite their lack of depth. With a large fanbase, you have lots of opportunities to discuss things. I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen a shounen or is just getting into anime.
__
That's it! I really want to give this series the chance to prove my criticisms wrong, there's so much potential because I feel like it plays to safe at times. Perhaps I should give the manga a try? We'll see, haha.

                There is so much to love about demon slayer! The intensity of fights, the effort that goes into training, the struggle, and the comedic interactions between the characters YOU are experiencing the story every little bit of it. The art and music are fantastic! The water in Tanjirou's skills (and the others) isn't realistic at times and feels like something you find in ancient scrolls, adds an air of mystical and ancientness to it. The chanting music during tense demon encounters amps up the dread and somewhat gives me the mental imagery of draining blood! While the story is pretty mediocre (by no means bad)
                  Just about everything else is stellar for an action anime and I'm ecstatic to see where it goes from here. Here's hoping for a second season soon!",9,Upset_Nimbus

                After seeing how overly rated this series got i think I have to give my opinion. Overall I think that demon slayer is a decent show and is just your typical battle shounen that comes out. The plot has nothing special about it. It was simply Tanjiro wanting to turn his sister back to being a human and avenging his family by killing Muzan. I feel like I have seen this exact same avenging premise in multiple different anime. I believe the only reason why people love the show so much is because of how good the animation was. Another show that had great animation
                  was Seven Deadly Sins and people loved the series but when the animation took a dip in season 3 everyone started to hate on it. I'm not saying that it didn't deserve the hate because it really did and I'm not saying that Demon Slayer is a bad show, I'm just saying that it got way more attention than it should have.",6,MadmanX32

                This is a review of the 26 episode first season of Demon Slayer--I have not yet watched the rest of the series. This is the take-away from those first 26 episodes:
Demon Slayer is all the best and worst things about shonen anime.
Eye-catching character designs are spent on a too-large cast of one-note bit players.
An interesting main antagonist is introduced too early, undercutting all of the stepping stones that lead up to him.
Lesser antagonists have uniquely interesting abilities and exist wholly within the incident in which they are introduced so that they can be defeated and then given a flashback scene to retroactively attempt depth.
Worldbuilding is
                  evocative with a compelling setting that proceeds to be unexplored and filled with sloppily written one-off details like some humans happening to be equivalent to a hundred humans for a demon's diet.
The main character speaks in triumphant absolutes that sound very cool and defiant despite them often being self evident--Yes, Tanjiro, the human-devouring murder demon is bad and, as you connect your finishing attack, you absolutely won't let them keep hurting people.
Characters are juxtaposed to each other to highlight their strengths and flaws--even if it means some characters have to be very obnoxious as a foil to our even-tempered protagonist or others have to repeatedly stab his innocent sister to show how unflinchingly violent they are compared to our moral goodboy protagonist.
The main appeal of the work is creating flashy, dramatic combat sequences that are visually impressive; without fail the structure of every fight is that a protagonist will use an over-the-top technique to defeat the demon that has been hounding them, even if this means having to stumble head-first into techniques and wins that feel unearned and, ultimately, undermine the already low-stakes monster-of-the-week struggle.
Comedic gags are hit-or-miss, often physical gaffes or a character over-reacting to something.
Dialogue is straightforward and motivated by the scene at hand, characters have strong voices that reflect their extreme personalities; dialogue is almost never natural and fails to humanize the characters as a result.
All in all, it'd be easy to write Demon Slayer off as derivative--it's borrowing a lot of both the best and the worst elements of many of its predecessors. Despite having some captivating original elements, Demon Slayer never quite elevates itself above being aggressively genre-standard. That's alright, though. If this is the kind of show you want to watch, it delivers well enough. If you don't like this kind of anime, you're not going to like it. It likely makes a good starting point for someone interested in the Shonen genre, as it is an enjoyable representative and any singular element can be traced to a series that's handled that element better.",5,ZeroEnigma

                When Demon Slayer first aired, the hype was insane. People were absolutely raving about how amazing it was and crowning it legendary next to series that are widely regarded as such. It got me excited to check it out and I was extremely disappointed as it did not live up to the hype in my eyes, especially the (in)famous episode 19 that got fans gushing over the series. Episode 19 is where I drew the line and dropped the anime during my first viewing of the series. A year later, I decided to revisit the anime and watched it from start to finish. During this
                  second attempt at watching the anime, I didn't hold it to the high standards that I initially had due to the praise it received. Upon finishing the anime, I would say that it was an entertaining experience overall, but I still can't get over the glaring disappointments that led to me dropping the series the first go around:
1) Tanjiro's breathing technique was basically given to him off screen. One episode you see him introduced to water breathing, then the next few episodes he seemingly knows how to use every form in any scenario without showing any trial and error during his training. 
2) Nezuko's character was essentially killed. The muzzle is unnecessary and she's  treated like a pet by Tanjiro at times. What Urokodaki did to her erased any sort of character development potential that Nezuko had as her ""choices"" and actions can no longer be credited to her free will. 
3) Zenitsu. Annoying. 
4) Inosuke. Annoying.
5) The show is unable to commit to setting a serious tone or mood during certain scenes. When the show seems to be in climactic and pivotal parts of the story, it is without a doubt and without failure going to ruin the mood by inserting ""comedic and playful"" banter. Every. Single. Time. You'll know when they do this because the art style changes. It's just so annoying how often this happens. Demon Slayer would have been so much more enjoyable if the creators were more mindful of when and where to place their ""comedic and playful"" banter. 
6) The climax in episode 19 consisted of 2 top tier ass pulls. There was no foreshadowing or buildup to what happens or how the 2 characters gain their powers. The first ass pull was bizarre enough as this new power was never hinted at or mentioned at all. The second ass pull was the biggest disappointment in the episode as this character was essentially sidelined the entire series and *never* trained.
7) The animation was given such high praise and I admit the show was aesthetically pleasing. However, there were so many times where a still frame was being used that it felt like the animation studio was cutting corners and taking shortcuts. Granted, this may be due to budgeting and time constraints. This didn't really bother me and wouldn't really have paid any attention to it had there not been such high praise for it. Of all the things that turned me off from the anime initially, this would be the smallest contributor.
8) The first fight in the series showed potential for tactical fighting, but it never came close to that level of strategy afterwards as the show progressed with the introduction of breathing techniques.
The Demon Slayer world began to open up after episode 19 and this is where I think it goes from good to great. I am looking forward to seeing where the story goes from here.",7,callducksquack

                When its art style is so damn attractive and refined, when its animation is such a spectacle to watch--how far can that get Demon Slayer before it runs out of steam due to incredibly mediocre writing and dialogue and obnoxious, one-note characters? Not very far, really.
Let's not mince words here--Demon Slayer looks fantastic. It has a bold art style utilizing thick outlines meshed with incredibly thin outlines while never being afraid to revert to silly, cartoony imagery when necessary. The fights can look memorizing--but unlike many's opinion, I find the 3D a huge turn off. There's a lot of praise for a particular fight that
                  occurs halfway through the show, but I couldn't believe how unbelievably bland the execution was for it despite the novel concept--it's just a character flying around in a rotating 3D model. That's it. This scenario as well as other uses of 3D only serve to take me out of it all. But as for a bit more praise, the sound design is very well done--something that I usually don't think about when it comes to watching anime, frankly. Every impact genuinely carries its weight thanks to the fantastic sound design, and the soundtrack, while forgettable, definitely fits each scene well. Some of the voice acting isn't too bad, either--there are some painfully generic voiced characters (such as most side characters and the villains), but others shine very well in their shoes, like Tanjiro, Inosuke, and Giyu, the last of which doesn't exert himself too much to essentially play his Dororo role again, but hey, he doesn't necessarily need to.
This is where the praise ends, however. I've rated this show a 5 for a reason.
I don't really know how else to word this--Demon Slayer is bordering on the edge of being incompetently written. I say bordering because it's not as if the writing is horrific and unable to be tracked, because you definitely have a solid flow of events from one to the other and know what's going on all times. The problem is that it's 100% comprised of shonen tropes and bland dialogue, and nothing else. There are nearly zero shreds of originality found within Demon Slayer despite the interesting concepts introduced, like Tanjiro traveling with his demon sister, a man that wears a boars head, a corp of demon slayers unofficially sanctioned by the government--these are all cool and all, but the show doesn't REALLY do anything memorable or interesting with them in execution. When I watched Demon Slayer, all I could think was that I was watching some sort of ""Shonen's Best Hits!"" collection and would rather just be watching Hunter x Hunter instead.
Let me explain, because it's not fair to go ""oh this sucks, this sucks, and this sucks"" and leave it at that. The show is dull, and it is this way because it does not try to be anything else. There are a huge amount of fights, but none of them--and I do genuinely mean NONE--are ever solved with clever thinking, ingenuity, or--christ--having a character lose so that they can come back and try again with a new strategy or take. Instead, every fight ends with deus ex machinas--either the main character ""believes"" hard enough or he's rescued by someone else. That's it. That's every fight in the show. After watching Kaiji or, again, HxH, it just feels downright insulting to watch these battles unfold the same bland way over and over.
But when they aren't fighting, it's time for the characters to shine--kidding, they're all about as boring as the combat scenes are. When you write a character, you genuinely have some strong two dimensional elements to them--""Character is SAD because of issue, but is also ANGRY because of this issue. Character LIKE one thing and HATES one other thing""--you then expand on the concept and flesh them out so that they feel like a real human being. Such is not the case for Demon Slayer, in which characters are represented by their initial markings--Tanjiro is DETERMINED and KIND and LOVES his sister--and then never expanded on any further. No, seriously, try to argue the point after 26 episodes. He develops in no way whatsoever beyond these facets. The viewer never sees Tanjiro really come to terms of even really talk about his family's slayings. Tanjiro never expresses any interest in any sort of hobby or interest that doesn't have anything to do with fighting demons and holding his sister. He's just your run-of-the-mill shonen protagonist who fights for good, and that's it. The problem's made even worse when the show REFUSES to stop fellating the main character, with nearly every single interaction with Tanjiro and another character ending with them ooing and aahing over how kind he is, how noble he is, how gentle he is, and whatever else. It feels like a bizarre hug box and gets grating fast, as if Demon Slayer wants to have us believe Tanjiro is Jesus Christ himself.
You might read this and think I find Tanjiro the worst character of the show, but you couldn't be more wrong. That right belongs solely to Zenitsu, the blonde haired banshee of a character that feels genuinely written to spite his audience, as if Koyoharu Gotōge wanted his viewers to actually suffer while watching. Zenitsu feels as if he's straight from hell. From the moment we see his appearance on screen, he's already a miserable, loudly crying baby of a character--and do not mistake my words, for I love a character that can be realistically emotional and expressive, like Shinji of EVA. Zenitsu is not like this in any capacity, however. Nearly every scene depicting him shows him screaming, yelling, crying, wailing, and otherwise being a noise polluting nuisance. Most of Demon Slayer's awful excuse for ""comedy"" revolves around Zenitsu, with many scenes showing him being a coward--for laughs? It's really not funny the fifth time--or horny, as Koyoharu, for whatever reason, thinks it's goddamn hilarious that Zenitsu can't help himself from exploding in affectionate energy and chasing women--it happens constantly. He's written to be redeemed by his ability to perform like an amazing fighter when passed out, but honestly? That's such a crock and does not forgive or pardon, whatsoever, the suffering of having to deal with his character the other 99% of the time.
It's just a shame because it's very impressive that Demon Slayer is both written and illustrated by Koyoharu, and there ARE good puzzle pieces lying around that could be more narratively captivating, but instead the show is clearly just a vehicle to showcase interesting animation and stop at that. Demon Slayer is an unfortunate example of pure mediocrity, performing no better than its predecessors and certainly not its successors. At the end of the day, Demon Slayer is a shonen anime, and besides fantastic stand-outs like HxH, it's a genre that lends itself to this cartoonish blandness. Either watch these 26 episodes because you want to admire neat art, or just skip it and watch something more worth your time.",5,proxime

                I went in completely blind, I only checked it out because a coworker said it was really good and I had the time to binge it.
I mostly just want to say this:
It is very good, but compared to how it began I'm now a little disappointed. At the start of the show, there was this gradual, tense, mysterious, old, and beautiful atmosphere. As soon as the main character starts his first mission as a demon slayer however, I began to see the same tropes I've seen before in fighting anime. Once it introduced weird outlandish weapons, traits, outfits, and hair colors, it went from unique
                  to typical. This show also started to make me question what exactly demons are and why they differ between each other in this universe. Which isn't good, because now I'm just distracted by all the convoluted-ness of it. Towards the end, it's really no different than shows like Naruto, MHA, or One Piece. Everything becomes familiar. Guy gets strong element-based powers, opponent is stronger, dude defeats opponent, rinse and repeat. 
These aren't bad shows - if they were, they wouldn't be popular - but I am sad this show's first season started so unique and ended up so cliché. I really wish it had stuck to it being just the MC and his sister, following the two on a journey for a cure while meeting a few colorful characters on the way. I kind of understand why he joined the demon slayer club, but I find myself questioning why he didn't just go off on his own. I don't know, maybe I'm just not in the mood for an eventual complicated war involving 20+ characters. 
Pros:
- Beautiful. The art direction is amazing, and I love the mix of media
- Emotionally driven
- Overall enjoyable 
- The characters are fun, though I liked the ones at the very start more than the ones we get introduced to later
Cons
- Samey
- Some characters are grating and could turn people away (i. e. lightning guy)",7,YepsandNeps

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of the more recent popular shounen action anime titles to come out in its focus on series lead, Tanjiro Kamado, and his younger sister turned demon, Nezuko, attempting to locate the whereabouts of the demon that slain their family while hunting down other demons in their new profession as Demon Slayers. I'll be the first to admit that outside of Hunter x Hunter, I've found it increasingly difficult to care for many shounen action titles in recent years given I know of many of the cliches and storytelling formulas that typically come up in the more popular titles aimed for
                  the crowd and I find myself feeling either indifferent or frustrated with how elements of the storytelling, character personalities, and comedic timing can come off within these titles. My reception to Kimetsu no Yaiba is no different in this regard as regardless of the fanfare many have been giving it, many of the storytelling and character tropes for it are familiar territory to me.
But suppose before I get into my criticisms, I'll at least get into what I liked with the series. Ufotable being at the helm with animating Kimetsu no Yaiba makes it a nice visual spectacle with gorgeous scenery, good-looking character designs among human and demon characters, and great fight choreography utilized in a number of the action scenes and abilities demonstrated of the demons and human Demon Slayers involved. In its more serious moments, the series carries a nice grim mood and dark aesthetic to fit the hardships and struggles faced by Tanjiro and other characters during their encounters with enemy demons. There are some effective moments of drama and horror conveyed such as Tanjiro witnessing the aftermath of his family's murder and scenes where series antagonist, Muzan Kibutsuji, makes his presence felt to bring violent misery upon anyone in vicinity of him. Plus for a young male lead, Tanjiro is depicted to be competent, if a bit naive and inexperienced, in trying to get his bearings on dealing with demon threats and having to plan around the abilities of demon threats to land any killing blow on them, showing some battles to have strategy applied to them. As the demonic threats become more difficult, Tanjiro does find himself having to learn to improve his abilities as a Demon Slayer if he hopes to be up to Muzan's caliber to avenge his family.
Setting aside my praises, Kimetsu no Yaiba still carries a number of the same issues that befall shounen action titles of its ilk. Ill-timed comedy is a frequent thing throughout the series, even usually clashing with more serious moments. Said comedy often involves characters getting into emotional extremes and being rather obnoxious with it, Zenitsu and Inosuke being the worst offenders of this for their larger screen presence throughout the series with the former's cowardice and the latter's impulsive and brash personality. While I do praise Tanjiro for being fairly competent in combat, his character motives are still largely pretty typical being the idealist seeing the good in everyone and not allowing his personal beliefs to falter in his quest to restore Nezuko's humanity and trying to sympathize with the personal tragedies of the demons he slays, pretty much making him pretty shallow as far as character developments go. Nezuko isn't much better off as she largely exists to pander to the audience with her cute appearance and mannerisms outside of combat situations, not having much to show as a character beyond helping out her brother in heated situations. The series also has the bad habit of exploring the tragic back story of demons just as they are about to be slain in a superficial attempt to have the audience sympathize with them, despite the fact said demons were depicted to be irredeemable villains and lacked enough fleshing out and screen time to earn said sympathy.
The series also ends inconclusively just as it is about to start another story arc, though the story continues through with the Mugen Train film sequel for the TV anime and a second TV series is currently in development to further continue the series. Between its manga source material being complete and its current popularity, a full adaptation of Kimetsu no Yaiba should be quite likely to happen.
In short, I'm rather indifferent on Kimetsu no Yaiba to a large degree because of having a good number of the typical flaws and frustrating elements found within a good number of action-adventure titles aimed for the shounen demographic. I'll admit I did enjoy a fair number of the aesthetic elements, action scenes, and serious moments offered with the series. But the more troublesome elements of storytelling, characterization, and comedy from shounen titles still rear their head quite often within Kimetsu no Yaiba and I'm not invested enough into the series where I'd want to dabble into later installments of the franchise.",6,ggultra2764

                Demon slayer is one of those anime you will have a really hard time going into with a completely unbiased mindset. Your friends have either hyped it up to death or have talked about of overrated it is. I was lucky enough to have not heard much about it on my first watch through so I feel as if I can give a pretty unbiased opinion on it. Demon Slayer (being made by only one of the top tier studios, Ufotable) has absolute immaculate animation I've only been seen topped by few shows (that being JJK and the Fate series). If the gorgeous animation wasn't
                  enough you have an amazing cast of characters with very unique personalities. However, some of them do suffer from the same problem Black Clover did in that they have a trait that is basically used to define them, and every time they're on screen they beat it to death. A good example of how this was used includes the character ""Zenitsu"" (e.g. always screaming). Long story short, is Demon Slayer worth the watch to see what all the fuss is about??? ABSOLUTELY. Although it wasn't the best after finishing it I did not feel like my time spent was wasted at all.

                *Spoiler are present and marked*
Well, late to the hype train and in anticipation of a home release of the movie, I decided to give Demon Slayer a watch. Despite some red flags raised by some fellow fans, I had time to spare and I was actually kind of excited to go in and enjoy this highly reviewed and praised anime. After binging through it, I came out with very mixed feeling, maybe more than I wanted to.
Starting with the story as usual, Demon Slayer takes the simple approach. Simple goals, simple motivations, simple characters. A format with easily distinguishable parts, train->kill monster->next monster->next monster->
                  train. I don't want to do a disservice, obviously a few curveballs (hehe) are thrown here and there to mix things up and keep things flowing.  This, I d say, actually would work as an advantage for the show. Not everything has to be complex and intricate, a simple and refined story can work wonders when all the other pieces are in place. Unfortunately, I can't really shake off this feeling that some pieces are simply not in place.
What I believe, Demon Slayer and many others following this simple format fail at is characters and character interactions. And I want to go into details in this particular point because I believe it fails spectacularly. Starting with the good, Tanjirou is an good protagonist. He doesn't excel, but he accomplishes his job in the story. Parts like feeling pity for the demons killed, isn't anything out of this world, but through his eyes, we get to connect even with the ""monster-of-the-week"" and adds that extra bit of characterization he needs. It gives, what I would describe, as an almost bittersweet vibe as you feel like Tanjirou is the only one to care for them whereas no one else does (Don't get me wrong, it's still cheap to give backstory at the end of a fight all at once). Overall he is likable, so it's a BIG PLUS because of what is coming next. Not really much to say about his sister, Nezuko, she is just a delight  to watch every time she is on screen and the only parts of comic relief, I genuinely smiled at. The rest of the stoic characters we meet (mostly early on) are also good, but I guess it's not hard to write a cool stoic character.
Going on to his master now, while most of the moments he is on screen are great, this particular part about Nezuko and ""hypnotic suggestion"", I think it was, comes off completely wrong. Maybe I am getting the wrong idea, but it almost feeling like brainwashing and because of how Nezuko's condition and interactions are. This is brought up multiple time later on in the show, and it honestly cheapens her emotional development in a really bad way. This could had been her own character development of shorts, but instead this just line drops out of nowhere and leaves a really bad taste. Next, we have the two companions that join our protagonist .... and I really didn't enjoy most of their time on screen. They are mostly played for gags and comics relief, but it get so tiring that you get sick of them and the entire ""joke"" personality they convey. And it takes so much time to present anything else worthwhile that when the BACKSTORY hits, it hits on brick wall, build over 4-5 episodes of annoyance. To be fair, personally, I saw potential in one of the two (angry one), but that's about it. Nothing, BUT potential waiting to maybe actually give something of an actual character rather than a singular trait to be defined by. Lastly, the elite of demon slayers, the Hashira. And they too suffer greatly. There are two feeling I got from seeing them, hate and indifference. All felt like simple unlikable brutes (excluding the two we see earlier) with again, one singular trait defining them. One guy wanting both our protagonists dead, ""to spare them"". Another literally jumps in out of the blue, toys with the protagonist and stabs Nezuko for what seems to be simple enjoyment. This isn't how characters are done, especially because of what WE have seen him go through the literal last episode. And it's a shame. The potential is always there. **Spoiler warning: the ""testing Nezuko"" scene can still be played out and have actual weight behind it, if not done by a brute with no character other than MEAN. The author plays his cards right and it turns from a white and black situation to an actual debate with real heavy feeling from characters who have seen suffering in the hands of Demons. It's honestly frustrating. And FINALLY, last of the last, the previously mentioned female Hashira we see earlier, literally changes stance in between episodes with no actually growth or convincing to be seen.  How do you go from ""out for blood"" for a demon protected by to human to ""I like your style, I wanted to find someone like you""? **
Dialogue greatly suffers as well because of the problems mentioned in the previous two paragraphs. Pretty sure, there is one or two scenes relying on the ""show, don't tell"" technique and everything else is slog of exposition of things we saw, could have seen, or don't even care. There are few dialogues that feel like two real people would have and the rest feel like a every Shonen ever. Again, real lost potential to improve and refine an formula that has been done over and over again.
Enough negativity though, I did finish the anime and I did actually get some enjoyment out of it. And that's because artistically, it's near perfect. The sound design is amazing and draws you in to each beautifully animated set piece. There is weight, there is a feeling of movement and the anime doesn't shy away of letting the music go silent and let you simple enjoy the beauty of it all. But when there is music, it steals the show. What I, an uncultured boy, would describe as old sounding Japanese instruments and elements add to each uniqueness and I personally welcome a little distancing of the usual electric guitar hype music that is most usual in fights scenes. Going back and actually listening to the tracks is something I d recommend most people and I, for one, added many of them to my playlists. And the animation.... it's just all too much. My poor vocabulary honestly would fail to describe the sites I watched, but I will say this, it's a first time experience and I believe it will be for anyone, new or old to anime. The perfect blend of CGI with what could only be describe as a canvas brought to life is honestly amazing. I have seen no other CGI used so well, to show off the movements of the swords and the elements they represent. It's definitely some of the most unique and pleasing eye candy. Every fight is made memorable because of the great job done by the animators.
Transitioning the actual mechanics of the fights themselves, I was quite pleased. I had fears in the beginning that the simplistic story would translate to simplistic fights, but I was surprised. Every fight is unique and while not crazy mechanics and power systems are in play, the fighting stays consistently fresh, with the foes possessing new abilities each time. Overall, it compliments the rest of the presentation and is what makes the show successful.
There is not much else to say about Demon Slayer. It is a really conflicting verdict for me, but I do have to value a decent story and characters more than cool colors. I would still recommend this anime to many and I do think it's a good gateway anime for many and I am still hyped to see this story continue. I can only hope that as the story progresses the story issues will iron themselves out and the fight will continue being awesome.",6,jimmyking007

                This is an amazing piece of art by ufotable. Although it has its flaws which definitely blew my experience watching this. Kimetsu no Yaiba is an anime which I can certainly recommend, especially to new comers of anime.
TLDR: This anime has amazing art. But some inconsistencies in the writing and world building just knock off some of that watching experience for me. Note! Some spoilers ahead!
Let's start off with the good: Animation
This is the highlight of the show and why everyone is talking about it. First of all, well done by ufotable for giving us some of the best sakugas I've seen in awhile. The
                  style that ufotable brings is one that mixes CGI with traditional hand animation nicely. Because of that we are able to experience some of the best fighting scenes in anime in maybe the past decade or so. The way they can work moving camera angles and dynamic environment is just box office level. 10/10
And the bad: Inconsistent Writing & World Building, Characters are just sometimes basic shounen obnoxious types, Repetitive Pacing, and part of the show's ""chill"" time is a bit too giddy/slapstick for me
I'm going to rant a little bit on these notes. First of all there are a ton of inconsistencies in the way this show handles writing and world building. To point out one is during the Mt. Natagumo Arc during the battle between Tanjiro vs Rui. During that battle, Tanjiro manages to muster up the strength to slash Rui's neck off. But as Rui's head is sent flying off, it is revealed that Rui actually slashed his own head off before Tanjiro could do so. Thus preventing Rui from getting slashed by a Nichirin Sword and manages to live. BOOM! This is like the writing just hit itself, that is some bad logic in my opinion. If demons are immortal unless they are decapitated by a Nichirin sword then why can't they fight headless or create a demon art that somehow slashes their head off before the slayers can? It's kind of broken in my opinion. The show doesn't manage to give an exact description of how and what can kill a demon. It's not clear like Attack on Titan, there is a controller in the Titan's nape and if you slash the source, the titan dies. But in Kimetsu no Yaiba, all we know is you can kill a demon by sunlight, decapitate with special metal (Nichirin Sword), or by special potions (Shinobu). Why? Well because of reasons I guess. And there is also a part in the Mt. Natagumo Arc where Tanjiro must fight a headless demon controlled by the puppeteer demon, hmm... It turns out that cutting of his body to his lower waist is what kills him because Tanjiro's logic always works.
Next, I want to rant about the characters lol. I think in its heart, the writing of Kimetsu no Yaiba is very shounen-esque. You have spirit-over-ability comeback moments during fights, a never give up protagonist who everyone loves, and crazy side characters with unique designs (really unique). Aaaand that's where it blew me off. For context, during the show it is revealed that Zenitsu got his stunning yellow hair because he got hit by lightning (his original hair color was black). So, in my logic I thought that the character designers were aiming to design characters with a majority of real black hair. Because if I'm correct most characters before we saw the Hashiras were all designed with normal black hair (in the least some of them had tints in their hair such as Tanjiro and Inosuke. Demons don't count because they are demons). But all of the sudden the Hashiras are designed super crazy and all have borderline obnoxious personalities tied to their breathing styles. During that reveal, a lot of the world's immersion just blew off. If Zenitsu's hair turned yellow because of something supernatural then why does all the Hashiras have crazy hair too? Were they all hit with something supernatural? Remember character designs can tell us about world building too. And I think the designers did a exciting albeit inconsistent choice of design. Just because characters are super strong doesn't mean you have to make them look dumb.
My next rant is about the story notes and pace of the story. At most I think it is very repetitive. Tanjiro gets summoned to mission, he fights demon, comeback win, Tanjiro feels bad for the demon, the worst part: demon backstory, and characters go and rest to heal. Man, they don't have to give a backstory for every demon. I mean, if they want to send a greater message about suffering and people in destitute that's fine but I don't think their points hit the mark on this.
My final rant is about the show's chill time. Or basically when the characters aren't fighting demons. Its really clear when they are doing this. In these moments are the over the top slapstick comedy and the characters are drawn in 3 FPS blobs. I mean, its a good way to help cool down after a battle scene. Sometimes it can be enjoyable and funny but as the show gets further its starting to become obnoxious. The predictable pace also doesn't help because it really becomes clear when the show starts doing this. But I think it is a smart way to press down the animation budget for the sakugas though.
All in all I think Kimetsu no Yaiba is an enjoyable shounen for most anime fans. Although I had a lot of rants, the animation is still one to spectacle because of the amazing work ufotable has done. This is also a good opener anime for new weaboos or those trying to get their friends to become one. To be absolutely honest I think giving it an average rating of 8.97 (as of this review's writing) is a bit overrated. But hey, who am I to judge. My final verdict is 8/10.  I wish I could give it more of a 7.75 though.",8,deimos96

                Amidst all of the recent overdone superhero and nisekai tropes in the shounen genre, Kimestu no Yaiba brings us back to good ol' demon slaying, with darker themes and a story that is less fantastical; a story of revenge and mending.
Story: 8
I'll start off with what this anime does well, and that is the world-building and the art. Over the course of the show you're introduced to demons and what they are, the demon slaying corps, the sword types and breathing forms for sword techniques. Accompanying this, is some beautiful animation quality that does not take any shortcuts. Kimetsu no Yaiba is flashy and gory,
                  and will definitely leave some very memorable fight scenes.
Character: 5
What I feel that has much less impact is the characters. Amongst all of the vibrant animation, we're left with some very flat and generic characters that have, so far, not really developed or grown out of some very annoying traits. The MC, Tanjirou, is definitely a very lovable character, with a lotta heart, and I don't have many complaints for him. But from all of the side characters, to the villains, I have really been unimpressed and even annoyed by some of them. The side characters are bound tight to uninteresting, unfunny character tropes, and the villains are equally, if not more flat.
If you look at MHA or Ping Pong the Animation, I feel that what makes a great anime, is where you are able to look at the perspective of any other character or villain as the MC, it would still be a fantastic anime. I really can't do that here. Tanjirou is honestly the only likable character for me, and as good as the art/animation is, it doesn't distract from how unenjoyable all of the character interactions are. If they're not fighting, I feel like wanting to just skip past everything else.
Overall, its a slightly above average shounen anime. But it doesn't really live up to all the hype. Outside of the animation, a fairly mediocre show.",7,Mar-Sn

You will laugh, cry, smile and be on the edge of your seat for most of the show!!
The character and word building of this show is insane and one of the best I've seen!
Watching Tanjiro's journey from an unknowing kid, to a demon slayer is a really satisfying progression. 
You can feel the relationships that he forms and the emotions that he feels, they feel real
The one thing I don't enjoy is the arc lengths!, sometimes they feel too short and sometimes they feel too long.

                Imagine a show with a tense, dark atmosphere, an interesting setup, beautiful combat animation, and vast, vast potential. That's what Demon Slayer
was, before the ruinous introduction of the comic relief characters.
As soon as you see Zenitsu for the very first time, Demon Slayer completely abandons the serious atmosphere it had built up in favor of stupid, unfunny ""comedy"". Haha Zenitsu is a pathetic pervert. Oh so funny in my show about decapitating demons that killed the main character's entire family. Haha, I really needed that.
Things aren't helped any further when Boar Head guy is introduced. I finished the show, I finished the movie, and I
                  can say confidently that this show is no longer interesting in the slightest.
As other commentors have mentioned, the animation is fantastic, and beautiful. That doesn't change. But the investment you have in the potentially interesting story? That doesn't.
My recommendation to you is this: as soon as you see Zenitsu, stop watching. You've experienced the best the show has to offer already.",6,plasmi

                When I first started watching (Demon slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba) I thought it was good but nothing that special, so I quickly dropped it after the first episode. 
Sometime later I heard my friends talking about it so I decided to watch a few more episodes to see if the series had something interesting for me to invest in. To my suprise, the series was more enjoyable then I expected but it still was missing something crucial. I didn't really know what but the series didn't feel complete. Not long after, the series joined the other animes I dropped after a couple of episodes. I
                  thought this was the end between me and Demon slayer forever.
To my shock though, my friends were IN LOVE with this anime, so I couldn't help myself but to see what everyone was raving about. Then I finally saw what the series had done to fix thing, it introduced new, likable characters like Zenitsu and Insoke to tag along with the main character and later the scene that made this anime famous happened. It changed my outlook on the series completely and not only that, they also introduce other new characters that really made me hyped to see what wouldl happen next.

                I would say that this series is really worth the watch and the hype, I come from the point of view of someone who doesn't really watch a lot of shonen action anime, but I found that the artistry and fantastic main character really sold me on this. 
The art is just incurably and the character design is so perfectly done, I found that the ""hero's"" of the story were portrayed in such a way that they were incredibly noticeable and easy to keep track of in a fight, the Taisho era period that the show is set only helps to deep the interest I
                  had in this anime, its just perfectly done. 
I would say that there are some characters that are less than bearable in this show, but that's just my opinion, I think its worth the watch regardless, its one of the best shonen I have seen in a long time.",9,MeasuredTailor

                There's a lot of hype around KNY when ep 19 blasted in popularity, both non-anime fans and anime fans watched it and praised it. A lot of my friends recommended it to me and said that its the best anime they've ever seen, so I watched it and got utterly disappointed here's why.
The story is neither bad nor good it's mediocre. so we have the main premise ""turn Nezuko back into human"" the story revolves around Tanjiro a 15 yr old boy and Nezuko, his little sister. In Ep 1 we see his family get slaughtered by demons and his sister turned into one. This
                  is the main driving force for Tanjiro and what started the whole series. After that, we meet his mentor Urokodaki and one of the shittiest ""training arc"" in shonen history, the training arc only lasted 2 eps so you can already see the problem in it. The training arc was so rushed and done so quickly that it doesn't feel 2 yrs passed by. After this arc, KNY gets filled with a lot of tropes that further add mediocrity to the show. The Powers or Breathing techniques are awesome but it's not meta. The story is ok but it's not great. Storywise I will give KNY a 5/10.
The Art of the show has to be its strongest aspects. KNY is animated by Ufotable, the studio that animated fate/zero, fate/unlimited blade works, and fate/heavens feel. The fight scene was good enough to entertain me but it didn't entertain me as much as other shonen shows did. The choreography is ok, the effects are really nice to look at, and overall its a nice looking show.
The sound is also great, it properly conveyed moods and matches the whole show. The OP and ED are ok, Gurenge by Lisa is definitely a banger.
Now here's one of the weakest aspects of KNY, the characters. the characters are Flanderized to the point which it annoys me. We have Inosuke a tsundere, and Zenitsu a horny ass loud asf character. The show tried to add comedy by adding Zenitsu into the mix of characters but throughout the whole series, I didn't notice my self laugh. The other characters are good but I didn't get emotionally attached to them. The only thing that I appreciated was Nezuko cuz she's cute asf.
Overall KNY is a show that excels in the art department but it definitely doesn't deserve the hype it gets. It's a mediocre battle shonen anime that doesn't have originality and filled with tropes. If you're going to watch it don't expect stellar writing cuz it's only a good looking show.",6,cheekyboiii

Nothing new, great comfort food
Footnote:
Shounen's new golden boy is 100% worth your time. For one thing, (in Feb 2020)  it's THE THING, and it's always fun to have an opinion on THE THING. For another, the animation and aesthetic design are truly special....I have no doubt thousands of 12 year olds are shouting ""WATER BREATHING 4TH FORM!"" and thousands of 20 year olds are making knockoff DnD campaigns. The world instantly pulls you in.
Early episodes really shine with strong characterization and a well structured (if predictable) story. But as the episodes go on, my major complaint comes into view: The team dynamic. Inosuke and
                  Zenitsu (despite being different personalities) occupy very similar roles as the loud, goofy, blundering sidekick. And - since Nezuko can't speak - we only have one voice of reason in the main cast. We need another sane person on the team!

                From the animators of Fate/Zero, God Eater, and more of the Fate franchise, we get a long awaited adaptation of a long running series of manga by Gotouge, and along with the unspoken promise of fantastic animation, Ufotable has delivered to us once again some of the best visuals to be seen for years to come, but where exactly does the good bits of the show stop at? Quite frankly, despite the amazing animation and pacing of the first few episodes, it could be easily debated between many people that it drops off about as quickly as Platinum End did, becoming about as boring as
                  the mindless fighting that Demon Slayer had boiled down to be for an unprecedented amount of time.
To introduce all of my main points, I've spent a bit of time in the community, especially since the initial release of the Demon Slayer anime adaptation, and I find that it really isn't hard to find people who see Demon Slayer as an easy way to get to sleep on a troublesome night, but you also get the fair share of people who think that mindless fighting is the peak of anime culture, and by today's standards, this seems more and more true, and I can't disagree with that mindset any more than I already do. Demon Slayer is definitely an expert at activating a viewer's fight or flight response mid arc with its excellently animated and showy fight scenes, this along with its brilliant and vibrant character designs bringing in that daily dosage of dopamine that we all crave so much, and that may as well just be what Demon Slayer is good for, to its core and outer ends Demon Slayer is about just that, showy fighting with vibrant and outlandish character designing, the perfect drugs to a 14 year old boy's action fantasies. While I disagree that shows like this need any sort of philosophy or deeper thought, what I definitely agree with is that Demon Slayer definitely had a shot at it half way into Season 1 but almost missed entirely, hitting only the most inclined shounen fans who wish to see only everything good in the show, and to completely dodge anything they see that may be bad. But it appears that this is what held Demon Slayer back from how much more it could've become. It should be clear to everyone that the ratings are carried by the brilliantly choreographed action and bright flashy lights, but I also feel that this show is given way too much credit for things it hasn't done, like story telling.
First point I wish to discuss on why I didn't rate this show any higher than I already did, is that the story telling in this show is extremely flat-lined, kind of like the heart monitor on a grandmothers death bed; it's difficult to tell if the writer was even alive while writing it, while it's up for debate whether or not this show manages to branch any further than its desire goal, it's objective and undebatable that Demon Slayer can not beat its predecessors at their own game with this. Hunter x Hunter, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Attack on Titan are definitely fair competition to compare this to, considering the undeserved amount of hype this show has gotten in the sense of story, each of the anime I have mentioned above have all achieved to create a large branch out from the original story in order to create, and USE, room for innovation, and above all; detail. Hunter x Hunter foreshadows and eases itself into dark tones, Attack on Titan foreshadows all of its detail and manages to introduce insane twists, and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was able to make everything work together with not only strong pacing but character arcs and explanation.
Some people have said that the story is ""paced masterfully"" or that it ""has a deep meaning... ...showing the story and reason behind the demon's life and existence"", while I agree that a small portion of these statements may be true, it definitely is not executed well to almost any extent at all. Yes I did like the arcs towards the end of the show, namely episode 19-21, but in most departments it was extremely dull, not only lacking in proper depth by teaching any applicable lessons like a normal battle shounen tends to do, but also making the entire point of the show very mono-dimensional and skewed to one side of the story, showing the writer has neglected or even straight up avoided to tell the other half where there was SO much room to make, it isn't hard to imagine how anyone could hate the show for this exact reason, so in the story department, this show has an extreme lack despite the huge amount of potential the premise has set itself to work with.
My next point, and something of common debate within the community about Demon Slayer is that it's boring. I agree with this a fair amount, the first 19 episodes had just the characters walking up towards a place that I don't care enough to remember, and then they'd randomly confront some air of danger and then boom 3 or 4 episodes of imaginative fight scenes and glowing colours for seemingly little to no reason other than ""they happened to stumbled upon it"", which definitely feels less like effort in the animation and more a cover-up for how monotonous the fight really is. Some people have described it as staring at a wall while listening to a screaming baby for hours on end, while I feel this may be over the top in description, and maybe just a teeny bit exaggerative, it's hard to debate against the show being even a little boring and unenjoyable for an absurdly long amount of time, this is commonly due to the show being extremely dull in not only the writing as I said before but also how plain the primary concept of each fight is and ESPECIALLY the build-up. My largest complaint about the enjoyability of the show is the build-up and mainly the build-up, I get that shows need to add an air of random to get the twists it wants and added shock value, it had a very poor plug in Demon Slayer, to the point where it didn't feel like a necessary point in order to demonstrate power scaling, but more like just to have an excuse for a fight scene to not keep the show boring, in turn making the show boring. In defense of Demon Slayer, build-up may definitely not be its strong point for character or creation, but I can at least respect the main build-up to Kibutsuji, broadcasting him right in front of Tanjiro's face, never to be seen again for seasons to come in the show, in order to set the tone for random encounters enough to take seriously to some extent.
This review seriously has a lack of proper balancing such as Demon Slayer, so why not add a good point to the mix? We have to cut the show some slack because another department that Demon Slayer tries to execute is its structure. Demon Slayer is very episodic, or at least in its characters and shorter arcs, there are indeed of course, longer arcs during the shows duration, but it isn't hard to see Demon Slayer as episodic, which actually heightens my opinion on the show, for a battle shounen, it is very difficult to execute an episodic structure, so for how well it managed to pull this off you have got to cut it some slack. The same people with Demon Slayer in their favourites list are the same people who downplay Violet Evergarden, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, and Monogatari series, which are all debatably episodic in descending order, so for them to be as attached to Demon Slayer as they are despite it's apparent episodic structure is impressive, so props to the author for managing to do something that most writers find difficult to achieve.
The cherry on top point of this review will be yet another positive part, and it's that while this show definitely shows it's boring side more often than not, the later third of the show definitely has improvement. While it clearly lacks in its other segments during the later ends of the currently aired show, such as aspects of randomness, it most definitely becomes a lot more prominent in how entertaining it is. Ironically, the Entertainment District Arc was not only one the most entertaining story arc this show has offered us so far but is also one of the most visually gratifying experiences that anime can offer us, falling short only to anything Kyoto Animations and Wit Studio. The story in the Entertainment District Arc had definitely shown clear improvement since it's prior season and movie, not branching too far with OVERALL story for the show, but definitely was engaging enough to keep my eyes off of my phone, the reason for this I am unable to exactly pin-point but I can definitely tell why Demon Slayer fans say it's the better arc of the currently released ones, and unfortunately for my ego I have to agree with them on this one, not only was it extremely innovative but also had a good sense of sacrifice, destroying lots of stuff and lightening the strong sense of plot-armour the show had prior to the arc making it a lot more engaging to more than just the typical Demon Slayer fan. 
While I definitely have a strong opposition to this shows popularity and the wrongly spread idea that the story is the greatest thing since Brotherhood, it has clear author development in the writing, as the show adds outlying factors separating it from other battle shounens making it all the more entertaining as the show progresses, each arc being better than the last.",7,lFrogs

I like shounen. They are easy to watch. Short, ""completed"" Shounen are even better! You can just relax your mind while watching, you do not need to remember characters because they most definitely stand out by their hair colours and boy, what a colourful anime.
Story
Basically, we have our shounen boy who wants revenge and kills demons.
Storytelling
Not so great. I enjoy short stories but some details were missing, they were just added later on like a fact and it felt disconnected to the rest.Eg.: 
1. Tanjiro (MC) gets introduced with his mother and two younger siblings (it seems like they are the only ones in his family) but later on we see the rest of them. 
2. Tanjiros father was introduced too late, should have introduced him several times before the spider arc (typical no face but sad smile kind of flashbacks).
Credits to demon flashbacks, they were interesting.
Sound
Really enjoyed the OST in the first episode. It gave an ominous feeling, but that was it, never heard it again.
Character
I still can't believe how Tanjiro didn't question himself at all knowing that there were demons on the mountain where his family lives??? 
Tanjiro had fallen victim to the poor storytelling several times.
Zentsui, the yellow guy, was unbearable. I just wanted to skip every scene he was in. He is such a loud character, I still can't believe how he got to be a demon slayer. Yes he is strong, but he can not possible work with his attitude??? 
All in all really flat characters.
Art
The animation is ok, I loved the animation in the first episodes, but it got ruined by the lame CGI animations (eg the spiders). 
Top animation in episode 26.
The artstyle of the characters, I did not enjoy. They all look like they were shrunked into a smaller version of themselves. Childish looks and it wasn't because of their colourful hair but the propotions of their bodies. The main villain looks like a joke. His eyes are good but the rest doesn't fit. I really wanted him to be clothed in more elegant clothing, but he looks like a cheap version of Michael Jackson.
Enjoyment
Enjoyed it until the trio was introduced (Zentsui and Inosuke). It was funny sometimes but the anime could have cut some scenes out.
Overall
It is ok, it is not a badass anime, it has no great storyline, action is ok, comedy is ok, characters are ok.

                I am a bit of a sucker for period pieces and fantasy, so this series managed to scratch both of those itches at once. While I am not familiar with this particular period of Japanese history, I find that the interesting dichotomy of traditional folklore and modernization to be rather compelling. I look forward to seeing this explored in the future, since I have no past experience with the series' source material.
As for art, the animation overall was very nice. While they do resort to CGI on occasion, in general it was played in a manner that did not draw too much attention away from
                  the narrative. The design of the characters was very vivid, perhaps too over the top for the Hashira members introduced towards the end, but some license has to be taken with elite characters in anime. I also enjoyed the designs for the various Oni and trying to identify what particular yokai that inspired them.
Sound was also very good. I definitely enjoyed the LiSA opening, and overall the music definitely blended well with the scenes.
As for the characters, the only ones that I took issue with at times were Zenitsu and Inosuke. While I understand that they are both comedy characters, their antics were exhausting at points, especially Zenitsu. However, their contributions to combat and brief explorations of their backstories during the Mount Natagumo battle made up for some of my previous irritation. 
I am impressed so far with the balancing of the Oni villains. Most are effectively portrayed at tragic figures succumbing to human desires twisted to perverse extremes. They are never justified, but given context to help drive home the idea that people can become monsters.
Overall, I found this series to be very enjoyable. Nezuko is definitely very deserving to be one of 2019's top wiafu's, and I look forward to watching the continuing adventures of her brother and companions.",8,WeeabooHunter101

                I came for stellar quality fight animation, I stayed for the same exact reason. The dynamics of these parts of the show is astounding. The art sometimes takes on these ukiyo-e references that we all love. The movements are powerful and thrilling, and accompanied with rhythmic, traditional music that adds and subtracts where necessary, it is a formidable piece of work. These two combined with the gore aspect that appears whenever things get serious prevents this anime to be just another story within the genre that will go unnoticed.
As a sworn fan of stories full of magic-imbued, customized swords, demon-slashing and striving to be the
                  best by all means necessary I can't really complain. Although I'd certainly appreciate more worldbuilding to get a better hang of the powers and materials on which this story is founded. 
Disadvantages? Characters. Especially Zenitsu and Inosuke who definitely get too much screen time for their gags and beastly screams that substitute for proper characterization. I swear, if it wasn't for my angelic patience, I'd drop this story as soon as these two appeared. Fortunately though, the story soon took on a new spin and the two were caught up in a turn of the events that deprived them of ability to clown around. Most of the demons had better backstories than these two. A nice change is Tanjiro that follows a trend in modern animated series that draws a male character who has gentle qualities and is generally a polemic with the traditional masculinity trope (which is still omnipresent in modern audiovisual culture). But that doesn't unfortunately change the fact the characters are thick-lined (and that goes both for their development and visual design - take Hashira) and that may throw some off. That is, if a good fight isn't enough to keep you on your toes, which definitely isn't my case :)
Also the antagonist looks like Michael Jackson.

Kimetsu no Yaiba..
It's an enjoyable watch and a lot better than other shounen anime's I've watched in the past (i actually made it to epsiode 200 odd of bleach but had to give up because each fight took 2 episodes and the characters got very repetitive although i did like the cat woman)
The animation is great that gets solid 9 from the first episode to the last it's been consistently good.
Story line, the main character is a shining light in front the dark world he's been thrown into, he has no choice but to survive and we embark on his journey to save his sister
                  which is  a pretty tall order. Thankfully we don't have a character that constantly knocks himself and has self doubt every episode, he is motivated and will get his man in the end albeit with some sacrifices on the way no doubt.The story moves along pretty swiftly and most of the characters including the enemies have their own history which is covered nicely and not prolonged. Some filler bits and also his sidekicks that join later in the series which i would've preferred them not to have existed but they will have a part to play. There's some touching moments, you really feel the connection between himself and Nezuko and also from the other demon slayers that believe in him. Script wise it's pretty action type stuff unless it's a memory of the past etc then it goes a little deeper, for an easy watch with no real thinking involved it does it's job.
Sound, I can still hear the opening theme song so it's decent.
So i think 8.5% is a good score for the show, if you haven't seen it then it's for sure one to binge on.",8,Guts_01

                Demon Slayer is a solid shounen anime. Whether or not it goes beyond that is where it struggles.
The show is a wonderful visual treat, first and foremost. Demon Slayer's gorgeous art is beaten out only by masters like Shinkai or Ghibli. The worldbuilding, too, is done fairly well; the cities and machines contrast vividly to the mostly traditional countryside you see throughout most the series, creating a sense of almost timelessness. The power system is continually interesting, especially as it moves farther into the series. It does unfortunately feel like somewhat of a deus ex machina the first few times you see it, but as
                  you move through the series it remains consistent while building off of itself. Fight scenes are well done exchanges where Tanjiro throws everything into outlasting his opponent's attacks. The OP and ED have become iconic at this point, and the background music does its visuals justice. Technically speaking, this is peak shounen.
Where I find problem is it's inability to find broader themes. The characters were no cliches, but neither were they all that deep. Tanjiro and his sister were sweet and pure, his companions were silly but gave good interplay, and the demons were as terrifying as the other demon slayers were impressive. They all worked for the story, but none of them went beyond. The humanizing of the enemy was fascinating-but Tanjiro never struggles with finding that humanity, so it's never really explored. Backstories are diverting tear-jerkers, but not wonderfully connective or relatable. Progression was simple and linear. Few questions or mysteries are given to us to look forward to resolving. There are no challenges to society or people or ideals, and that is ultimately a dissapointment.
Demon Slayer is a good anime. It avoids falling into the pitfalls of its predecessors and finds it's footing easily. It's a casual watch that will easily appeal to any action fan, but it fails to intensely hook anyone who doesn't love these kind of battle anime. If you are looking for a suggestion, Demon Slayer is obviously worth the watch, but don't expect it to be a favorite.",7,AraumC

                Oh boy, the seasonal battle shounen that everyone raves about, what does it do right? Well to be completely honest, nothing, the only thing it got going for it is the production quality from ufotable.I don't understand how someone can like this.The anime includes a cast of pretty basic characters with the same old personality traits while it relies on a little girl to carry it with her little charisma that attracts pedos.The plot is not interesting at all,very predictable.Honestly,the only reson I'm not giving this a 1 is because of the swords.To me this is the perfect example of style over substance and goes
                  to show that as long as something has flashy fight scenes it's very likely to be loved by the anime community. If you're not already a big battle shounen fan who's able to watch a series for the action sakuga alone stay far away from this series.",1,ManOfTheCulture

                Demon Slayer provides perfectly executed cinematography, a stunningly beautiful art style, and a well-acted ancient Japanese speaking style providing for some fantastic edge of your seat action and emotional intensity even if it is weighed down by an extremely run of the mill protagonist and one note side characters.
Demon Slayer is an extremely enjoyable edge of your seat action anime that propels itself forward thanks to the creative art style, fighting choreography, and industrial Japan setting. When creating an action anime, of course the number one priority is to make sure the action is as engaging as it can possibly be and Demon Slayer delivers.
                  Not only is the choreography the best I’ve seen in years but the heavy weight of the fight scenes is perfectly balanced. When Tanjirou swings his sword, the anime focuses on each of his actions to add suspense and weight to each fight scene. From the shots of Tanjirou gripping his sword, to his breathing, to his surroundings, to the initial swing either he or a demon takes every second is spent on something interesting to build suspense, and once the action begins the choreography and camera angles follow Tanjirou and his superhuman moves perfectly in a brutal set of intense action and vibrant color. The edge of your seat action is complimented by Demon Slayer’s Industrial Japan setting complete with some extremely compelling voice acting and historic Japanese speaking styles to perfection, adding to the setting and atmosphere of the show. Focusing on the industrial age rather than ancient Japan worked perfectly to establish different settings and toolsets for battles. Additionally, the action in Demon Slayer works perfectly to entertain and grip the viewer into the setting and is uplifted by very well crafted demons in terms of unique abilities which adds to the entertainment value of the anime. It was especially intriguing to see Tanjirou use his mind and training to overcome and dissect each demon’s strengths and weaknesses during each fight. We have demons that use lengthy webbing string, demons who use drums to flip rooms, demons who use balls and portals, etc. Therefore, when Tanjirou encounters a demon, he must not only rely on his strength but dissect each demon’s unique abilities adding suspense to the show. Each side character’s abilities are unique and interesting as well. We have characters that use poison, characters that use speed, and characters that use pure strength. Due to the abilities of these characters, the action and animation throughout the show continues to be suspenseful and engaging throughout its entire run time. The high level art style and focus on character expressions combined with the perfect level of ancient Japanese dialogue during the fight sequences also added a heavy weight of emotion to the anime.
Despite the incredible action in Demon Slayer, this anime is weighed down by a lack of interesting characters and a very standard protagonist. I enjoyed Demon Slayer for the action, but the lack of interesting characters or character progression in the show left for non-action/storytelling related moments to be hollow and the main reason is Tanjirou. There are many shonen anime that feature protagonists like Tanjirou who start off weak and spend much of the anime rising to the top. Many shonen anime follow this basic storyline and there are countless protagonists that are extremely similar to Tanjirou. However, generally most of the top shonen anime are generally elevated by a more massive scope, incredible world building, or a plethora of 2 dimensional side characters or layered story telling that offsets the protagonist’s ordinary demeanor. Unfortunately Demon Slayer, for approximately 98% of the time is focused on Tanjirou and his party’s struggles alone. Tanjirou’s personality and demeanor is comparable to every cliché a shonen protagonist goes through. He is presented with an initial traumatic situation which leads him on a part revenge quest, part medical quest as we see him become physically stronger. However, his personality or character itself doesn’t progress through the run time of the anime. From the beginning to the end he is still very much the same stubborn but passionately strong childlike person… just a lot stronger physically. This wouldn’t be as much of an issue if the focus of the anime was a lot broader or if it had a much larger scope, or featured a more multi-dimensional story that goes beyond just defeating the bad guy but it never comes to pass.
The issues with the characters also go beyond Tanjirou into the cast of side characters who are the lowest common denominator of one note personalities. We have Zenitsu. He is a wimp. We have Shinobu. She is always calm. We have Inosuke. He is a meat head, and so on and so on. This is made even worse that most of the time these one note characters are used for unfunny and sometimes out of place comedy which detracts from the show.
Demon Slayer is outstanding, as an action anime, and the genre was in need for a modern ninja based anime with some great action and animation. However, Demon Slayer stumbles in terms of characters and features a very standard shonen storyline. That being said, I would recommend Demon Slayer to anyone interested in an action anime set in pre-modern Japan.",7,MontuBGTB

                Demon Slayer obviously has great visuals, art style, and sound design. The production value of the anime is consistently movie level quality. Its characters all have great and unique character designs that tell you a lot about the characters, like Tanjiro's beautiful traditional clothing and the 10 hashiras at the end. Unfortunately, this is where the praise for Demon Slayer stops.
-Plot. There really isn't much plot to speak of. Tanjiro becomes a Demon Slayer and most of the plot is him being sent around by a bird to fight random demons. Not having an extremely structured plot is fine, but I think that other aspects
                  of the show such as the characters would have to make up for it in that case, but this doesn't happen in Demon Slayer. 
-Characters. The characters in this show are static, except for Inosuke who does receive some development. The characters are likeable enough (except for Zenitsu), so what is the problem with them? It's that since Tanjiro and Nezuko's worldviews are so righteous, they will always act in extremely obvious ways, ex: protecting each other, saving strangers, jumping into danger, and respecting even the demons they kill. They basically act the same way every episode of the series, and at some point it just becomes repetitive. The bond between them is never tested. There is no lesson learned for them from the demons they kill. Tanjiro and Nezuko are just perfect people here to cure the world from demons and achieve their goal. 
It might be that their unrelenting convictions is something people like about this show, but personally I like it if my characters' ideals change a little bit from episode 1. If they don't change, then the world should change around them in a way that conflicts with their ideals, but nothing like this happens in Demon Slayer.
-Zenitsu. I watched this in sub like most, but Zenitsu made me wish I had watched it on mute. I'm not sure how people can deal with this guy. It's fine if he has a cowardly personality, but they beat it over our head episode after episode with his annoying yelling. Every time he speaks I just want to stop watching. He's just episode after episode of whining Tanjiro and Nezuko's names in order to generate some sort of ""comedy"", but completely fails doing this. He has to be one of the worst comic relief characters I have ever seen and the definition of beating a dead horse. Just like most of the cast, he doesn't change or receive development over the course of the season. At least he stops his yelling a little bit by the end of the season, so the last arc is a little more bearable to watch.
Demon Slayer's art style, animation, and sound almost completely carry it for its 26 episode runtime. However, it's not enough to carry its plot and characters.",6,megahugestrike

                5/5, Truly an amazing anime, it is my favorite one [might be biased because it was my first anime] it can make you laugh make you cry, or be mad. It can also make you get hooked into the show like THAT! *snaps fingers*. you tend to grow onto each character and enjoy watching them progress throughout the show. My favorite characters [along with many others], are Izuku Midoriya, Katsuki Bakugo, Shoto Todoroki, Ejiro Kirishima, and Tamaki Amijiki. To be honest I love each character equally but those 5 are 1% better, in my opinion, that is. You just care for them and wish that
                  they were real because they are perfect. The fans also have a huge wide variety of cosplays to fanfic. My hero academia works wonders, they convey a strong message that anyone can do anything and they make it so the characters are relatable to some degree. there is something that everyone loves, not to mention that it is the 3rd or 4th best anime for years.

                Consisting of mediocre writing and outstanding graphics Demon Slayer is one of the most popular Shounen genre Anime out there. The story was somewhat lacking also considering it was Shounen. The Art however was something that could alone be the reason why you should watch this show. Character design is according to me lacking because of Inosuke. But I think that was intended. The MCs are well developed though. But the BEST thing is obviously the battle.What you would expect from a Shounen series. I would recomend not reading the manga after watching the first season and the movie becuase the second season is coming

                I rate it an overall 6/10.
The show starts off as you'd expect, a little slow, character development, world building, etc... I rather disliked the MC's upbringing to power and how they were able to join the corps and escalate to the power of the main antagonist. It fell on its face for me in terms of the story telling; however, I thoroughly enjoyed the combat and how it was portrayed, it was fantastically done. Had there been a better written story to supplement it, I'd have enjoyed it much better but alas, otherwise.
The characters were a 5/10 for me. They weren't bad, as I've seen
                  much worse, but they weren't good by any means. Again, I'll reiterate the poor development of story and characters myself.

                Very good anime, but I think that people are overrating a little bit, it's just the first season, you can't say ""This is the best shounen / anime ever"" This remembered me when Attack on Titan season 1 was over, a lot of persons said ""This is the best anime"" When AOT just had 1 season, now AOT has 3 seasons, and you can say that AOT is one of the greatest anime of this decade because with 3 seasons the story is very complete and complex , the animation is good, the ost are good, the characters are good, etc.

                Demon Slayer is an enjoyable and refreshing shounen. Wasn't perfect, but it was still very well done. Looking over the review I'm about to post, it seems pretty critical, but in spite of that, I genuinely quite liked the show.
Story: 8
A new member to the ever-growing subgenre of ""these monsters eat humans and we need to kill them but oops now we've got like a half-human-half-monster and we're conflicted about it."" So yeah, it's kind of been done before, but this time it's not the main character, it's their sister, so it's super different. But really... it's done pretty well and it doesn't feel too
                  much like a rip-off of anything so it's a solid 8 from me.
Also I guess this where I mention the odd pacing at the start of the show. A lot of the things you expect to be big, multi-episode arcs are over in the blink of an eye. That's just how long, non-episodic shows go though; you've gotta wait through the shorter, more simplistic arcs to get to the good stuff. Finish the tutorial, so to speak.
Art: 8
The art in general is very good, though the cgi can be a bit jarring at times, at least if you're bothered by that sort of thing. 
Some of the character designs are a bit... just not my taste. Some of them are fantastic, but others have weird colour palettes, unappealing placements of face markings, odd hair and eyebrows.
Also this is one of the shows where you can tell who is important by how much thought is put into their clothes. I was really taken aback initially by how they taken the time to give all the characters detailed haori and kimono, but that fell apart pretty as soon as the unimportant characters came around. I know it's cheaper, but man...
Sound: 9
I'm not very picky about soundtracks, so all I can say is no complaints. OP and ED really grew on me by the end.
Character: 7
It was quite relieving to have a shounen main character that I actually enjoy, but still, this is the category where I have the most complaints. Firstly: some of the characters are just... a lot. Especially the villains and some of the higher level demon slayers. Just flamboyant and edgy and weird. A lot of their powers too are just... maybe trying to hard to be original?
Remarkably I don't mind the sidekicks Zenitsu and Inosuke so much, largely because I just enjoy Tanjiro's pained facial expressions whenever they get up to shenanigans. They're great foils. I also appreciate how Zenitsu makes you go ""how is HE one of the half dozen people who survived the entrance test?!?"" but then the more you learn it actually makes sense. Wow: questions asked and answered without a monologue, nice.
And then we get to the main character's sister Nezuko. I like her, but for how much she's around, I'd like to get a bit more out of her than just being some object of Tanjiro's motivation who occasionally pops out for a deus ex machina.
But like I said, I am a fan of Tanjiro; I appreciate his struggle between the irrational boiling emotion that drives him and the cool focus that he actually needs to succeed.
In conclusion:
I really expect Demon Slayer to be one of those nice slow burn shounen anime that takes a while to get going and gets really fantastic once its foundations are set. Well rather, the foundations ARE set now, and I expect subsequent seasons to follow the quality of the later story arcs. Here's hoping for more character development, more Nezuko, and more of that good-good episode 19 stuff.",8,nadaci901

                I got into Demon Slayer mainly because of a lot of the hype surrounding it, and for the first few episodes, I was enthralled with the world-building, even if the characters were found a bit lacking. As the series went on, though, I found it harder and harder to push through.
It has maybe 7 or 8 good episodes and the rest is some VERY boring filler. The side characters are insufferably annoying, and there is just way too much ""I see his moves now, if I use this move, then I can defeat that move, and blah blah blah my breathing.""
The animation is amazing, and
                  the main villain is truly terrifying, but we get so little of him that it's really just a tease. Hopefully it gets a much better second season (haven't watched Mugen Train yet) in order to flesh those things out.
All in all, I wouldn't believe the hype. If you can settle on excellent animation, then go for it, but if you need a great character or story to hang your hat on, you'll find Demon Slayer lacking.",6,HonkerMuddlefoot
38000,"
                Demon Slayer has the best animation I've seen in an anime so far (admittedly with only 50 under my belt as of writing). It's an aesthetically pleasing anime, 10/10 art/animation as far as I'm concerned. The sound follows pace, with nice music to accompany it. I can understand and respect the hype of the show on these grounds.
It also holds a solid story with good characters. The darkness in the show works well, sometimes it's good to have an anime that takes itself serious when needed. The first episode is pretty screwed up, and the dark themes continue throughout the show. But the spirit of
                  Tanjiro stays strong. He seems a little generic with his behaviour, like a standard hero, but I think it's his relationships with other characters that provide him with depth. His friends and allies are likable and interesting in their own right, and so are the villains. Nezuko (Tanjiro's sister) is also adorable. Wholesome vibes. Not really a waifu, more of a little sister sort of character. She's also cool and surprisingly badass. With each demon you get to see a side of them that makes them, well, human. And that's something that Tanjiro likes to believe in.
It's must watch media in my opinion - not to mention it's sequel film which is excellent and sequel anime which is meant to be top notch. I'm looking forward to watching it. In any case, this first season is an 8/10 for me.",9,mr07

                Measured based on the popularity and quality of the merchandise this should be the best anime ever. In reality, this is a very bad anime with an average animation and the worst story I have seen in long time – I mean, a Teletubbies-like story (Nezuko sleeps, Nezuko sleeps, …, demon attacks, demon attacks, …). 
The characters do things with no reason just because the story needs that to progress – such as that, in first episode, Tanjirou spends a night at his neighbor’s house just to allow the demons to kill his family and start the story or when Nezuko sleeps for 2 years
                  straight just because Tanjirou needs to train to become the Demon Slayer before the story can continue.
The plot is about demons eating humans yet, on the “crime scenes” you see full bodies with just small scratches and lots of blood around (as same as in any zombie horror). The main bad guy should be the “most powerful demon” yet he is pretty much the Vlad the Impaler (aka Dracula) and the good guys are just Van Helsing (or Blade, if you like) and his group killing vampires (oh, I mean demons). 
Animation is done by a 3D computer graphics converted to manga-style by 2D color filter (aka Futurama style). This means movements are very smooth and complex with lots of effects during fights. Characters has lots of details and looks great. Except for Nezuko, who does not move at all most of the time and makes the simple (“stupid”) manga faces all the time.
However more than 70% of the time fills talking scenes, where the characters, who don’t speak, are just static images. In longer scenes you just see a static images (a wall or a floor) or very simply animations (burning fire, falling snow, etc.) so that they don’t have to animate the face and hand movements. About 30% of time fills the fight however most of them are composed from classic ""static character on moving background"" scenes where opponents explaon what they did and what they will do next. The only moment you can really enjoy (which takes less than 2 minutes of a each 20-minute episode) is when Tanjirou uses a special technique and finally kills the demon. Nezuko is mostly motionless even during the fights. Only when a demon gets near her, she kicks him/her/it in the face.
My recommendation is to watch just the first episode, which is full of action, full of blood and violence, and full of emotions and sentiment. Later it gets only worse.",5,usagima

                (May contain slight spoilers)
I just love this show. The pure drive of tanjiro and the other demon slayers to achieve their ultimate goal of freeing the world form demons makes me more and more excited for every episode. The way we get to see them grow is incredible, as the plot moves forward we get to watch as these normal human beings refine themselves not only physically, but mentally as they train to face the hell of world they were born into. Normally in shonen's we see the main character start off with some crazy ability that nobody else can achieve, thus putting them apart
                  from the other cast members. In demon slayer it is the mindset and training of the main characters that gets them to the point of being visually ""strong"" and usually we are apart of that training as we get to see them progress as time goes on. I really appreciate that there isn't just a time skip and then whoosh they are crazy powerful after training on a mountain for 5 years. On top of that, I really love the aspect of the complete difference of strength between characters and the impossibility factor we get as we see new villains introduced, for example when we first come across lower 5 (Rui) it almost feels like  he is the final boss/obstacle of the series, when in reality he was just a small stepping stone for the cast as they fight their way up through the twelve kizuki. The infinite growth and potential of the demon slayers is what brings me all the hype I could want from an animated series. However, apart from me I believe the reason so many people love this show is because the themes ARE deep (depending on how you look at it), but delivered in a simple, easy to digest way. Tanjiro fights to help his sister in any way he can, who met the irreversible fate of becoming a demon. Zenitsu tries to live up to his grandpa’s expectations, doing all he can not to cower in the face of fear. Inosuke, wants to be the best, even though he never had a fair shot at proper training. These characteristics make the show such a pleasure for me to follow along with. The Visuals are outstanding, the music gives me chills, the voice acting is top notch, and   the story is simple enough for anyone to follow along with. Sure, demon slayer has its fair share of cons such as the awkward humor that is implemented at weird times, or zenitsu's constant temper tantrums. Nonetheless, I truly believe that if you can look past these faults, demon slayer is actually quite the charm of an anime and one that will influence the shonen scene forever.",10,oSwun

                Story 6: kamado tanjiro is affected by a demon who kills his family. Her sister Nezuko barely survives, but he is transformed into a demon. Now tanjiro wants to be a demons slayer, so he can heal her sister.
The story is quite simple. A shonen were the MC has a objective and he struggles to achieve it. 
The world building is well made, it makes and interesting aperture to a world of demons and be a little interesting, but the course of the story leads to something boring and  repetitive. Tanjiro needs to kill a demon, the demon is the shape of cruelty and
                  evilness, and when he starts to die, a sad and tragic backstory appears to humanize the demon.
Art 10: We have to be honest about this. Ufotable made an excellent job making the animation of Kimetsu no Yaiba. With beautiful and colorful environment, scenes that could see real and very well paced fights. The character style is also quite good, lineal characteristics that resemble the personality of each one.
Sound 9: I don't remember very much of the music that it had, only the OP by Lisa that is very good attached to the story. But i remember the ost was beautiful, very well composed with classical instruments(a bit digitalized) that matched with some dramatic scenes. The ED is quite good too, but the special ED of ep 19 surpasses all the rest. Is so emotional and sad to listen while also being a very good song
Characters 5: Well.... characters are not the best. Tanjiro is a good character. It has development and it has his moral questioning against demons. He is just like everyone else would be, he is human.
But the main problem are the secondary characters. Starting with zenitsu, he really is annoying with his crybaby personality. Another issue is his bipolar attitude. In one moment is the most scared guy and in a blink of an eye he is more OP than everyone. They never explain why it is like it.
Inusoke at the first time i saw it i thinked, ""the crazy guy with no self thinking that the only thing he thinks is fighting"" i was not wrong. Its not great making a guy like that, is annoying. At the final chapters he matures a little, but just that.
Muzan, the main antagonist. Its just a cliche villain. The fearsome guy, the no emotions guy,  who is very strong just because he is the villain.
Enjoyment 7: at first it was a bit boring, but then when the fighting ep starts, it has bit o development in the enjoyment. Still, the story and characters are not the best, but the art and sound made it up for.
Overall 7,4: If you want beautiful animation and soundtrack with very well made fightings, you should check out kimetsu no yaiba. Rather, if you are more to a well constructed story a good characters, i would reccomend you go watch something else.
 Still, kny is a good anime but not the best, definitely does not deserve being rated so high in MAL",7,deskolta

                Let me get straight to the point: it blows my mind that this anime is so highly rated.
I believe it should be obvious for anyone who watched more than 5 anime how blatantly AVERAGE this one is.
But I guess everyone just got seduced by Ufotable amazing animation work.
Because really, thats all Kimetsu no Yaiba really is: beautifully animated.
Nothing else, from characters to story, makes it worth watching. And to me that is a shame, because even before the anime first aired I was excited to watch it and see how good it was, considering the great Ufotable chose to animate it.
Maybe this anime is amazing
                  for someone who never watched any other anime in their life, but to me I cant help but compare it to every other similar anime I have watched, and believe me when I say Kimetsu no Yaiba has a LOT of competition, and it really does not do well against most of them.
Right on episode 2 or 3 I had a feeling that this wasnt worth to keep watching, and after coming back and forcing myself to watch more, I still cannot believe the plot never gets any better.
And somehow this series ended up being one of the most popular anime series ever, not just in Japan but in the world.

                Kimetsu No Yaiba is a story set in the Taisho period in a world where during the day people live their normal lives, but at night, flesh-eating demons come to haunt them.

It's no doubt that this is an intriguing idea and is definitely liked due to the many forms that there are, ranging from the basics like water, flame, wind, or even rather unique forms like serpent, love, or insect. Now despite the fascinating forms of defense from mankind and a really interesting setting, does the story cut it? No. The story is ultimately really boring and doesn't go anywhere for majority of the series. Despite being pulled in by the thought of how Tanjirou will face the people who will try and kill his sister, and even seeing those very same people show aggression, it seems everyone has a change of heart for her simply just being cute. 
Art: 10/10      Sound: 9/10
There isn't much to say here. In terms of production, this show really had it all. The animation quality, as well as music/sound, was absolutely incredible, and really made some of the fights worthwhile sticking around for. There isn't much to go into other than amazing. 
Character: 2/10
Undeniably the worst part of this series. The characters. There are probably a lot of people who say ""Nezuko is the best Waifu."" or ""Inosuke is such a funny character."" Although everyone is entitled to their own opinion, to my thought these characters were just so boring and cliche. The main trio of slayers has the most random and unexplained traits of all time. Tanjiro can smell weakpots. Zenitsu can only fight when he's unconscious. Inosuke can shift organs around in his body willy-nilly. Let's start with the protagonist, Tanjiro Kamado. If Kirito could be put into this time period then Tanjiro is the result. Other than being a Mary Soo, his goal would be interesting if taking a different take on it. Tanjiro's goal is to turn his sister back into a human, and despite showing how much dedication Tanjiro has to save her, this never goes anywhere. Despite having a goal that is completely selfish to himself, every action he takes is for the greater good. The best characters in this series are undeniably the Hashira, and even then half of them share an edgelord personality. 
Overall: 5/10
In conclusion, Kimetsu No Yaiba isn't something you watch if you want a deep story, meaningful plot twists, and overarching and interesting character motives. It's just something you watch if you want flashy action as well as somewhat sad deaths. It's all-around a 5/10. Its action is beautiful and has some of the best-animated fights of all time but is just missing the story to support it. Those who want to dive into Kimetsu No Yaiba, go for it. Its anime will honestly probably be something that you'll enjoy and want to keep up with, just make sure not to give into temptation and read the manga.",5,AOESalmonella

                I'm going to get this out of the way. Yes, this is an overhyped one. No, I don't think it can be considered 'bad' by anyone discussing it in good faith. This anime is very good, and it's tragic that the discourse around it by anime nerds has become so cloying. 
CONS: A lot of the characters are very one-dimensional or tropey, ESPECIALLY toward the end. One of the main characters literally engages in sexual assault against minors during a few 'pervert humor' scenes that gets stale at speeds as fast as his sword. You often learn the tragedy behind a demon when he's already
                  dying, which is a bit too late to truly let the difficulty of this journey hit well. 
PROS: This is arguably one of the most beautiful anime i've ever watched at times. No, it's not 'just good looking', there's plenty to enjoy here, but it would be disingenuous not to admit that the art is just insanely gorgeous and that's definitely part of it. The fights are a joy to watch, the characters that are developed well are very cool to see, lots of demons are unique, and the story telling at times gets very very cool and creative. That said, the overall plot is pretty simple--but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Simple is fine, it's not a knock, not everything has to be cowboy bebop, what matters is how well that simple thing is handled. And largely, KnY is handled pretty damn well. I do highly recommend it, especially as an accessible show.

                TL;DR :
If used to watch anime and you seek for excellent ones, you should pass. This is a very classic anime with nothing spectacular.
Every told me : you should watch this Anime, it's great, it's so cool you going to love it. I didn't ask because I generally don't in case I badly interpret things or get a false idea (like, try to describe One Punch Man, it doesn't sounds interesting).
So I got into watching this, since I'm good public an able to watch a wide range of Anime.
Art : 9
One thing you cannot remove to this anime is it's graphics. It's a pretty well
                  mixed kind of art, with drawing, CGI and ""hand-drawn"" CGI (meaning it's used to add complex drawings). The style is quite unique, and far from classic CGI usage, like in Berserk or Overlorld for example.
Secondly, combat scene are excellent and really well directed. You will find detailed sword combat here (better than SNK).
Lastly, I remove 1 point because character expression (of some) are very ... short. You will understand while seing it.
Story : 9
The story is well driven, and there's no time for small talk. A lot is going on during these 26 episodes. Some franchise would have made last 3 times longer. However, this is a quite classic story, with a few twists and specificity, but somehow very common.
Some mystery are still hidden but you can guess them very easily !
Characters : 3
Holly cow. I haven't seen such bad character development in a long time. Basically, in 26 episodes, only Tanjiro and Nezuko got a ""more than 5 minutes"" character story. They (the others) have no personality, no background that wouldn't fit in a 15 words sentence. They don't talk to each other, it's mainly off voice.
Every character is thrown at your face, at a very high pace. It's disturbing really.
Two of them are really awful, sadly they are main characters.
Sound / Music : 5
Not good / Not bad. Really, nothing to say here.
Enjoyment : 7
Even if side characters are execrable and annoying, the story is focusing on Tanjiro, which get the anime back on track so you want to know the story goes. Sadly, given those characters and the poor base story, it's never going to be memorable.
Overall : 7
It has been a good experience since I'm good public. It lacks so much in the story and characters that it won't be remembered for sure. The author tried to add a lot of humor but really, even a 5yo kid wouldn't like it. It's horrific and it can last entire minutes.

                Demon Slayer caught my eye when it first came out. We've all seen the human vs. evil human-like creature trope done before in shows like Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Seraph of the End, etc. 
But there is something about demon slayer that sets it a part from the rest. It is an unpretentious show in the fact that it isn't trying to be something it's not. It takes a commonly seen trope and uses it to its advantage by showing the struggle between good and evil in a new light.
That is to say, the show is not without it faults. Tanjiro, the protagonist, tends
                  to fall into the dimwitted yet empathetic and overpowered group of main characters along with Gon, Deku, Eren, and many others. The pacing is quite start and stop in this season, sometimes in ways that seem unnatural. There are many time skips, and while necessary, they are hard to follow. The last 6 or so episodes of the show could be easily condensed into 3-4 episodes without losing plot or substance.
While there are things that could be better, Demon Slayer as a whole is a enjoyable show. The animation and character design set it apart from others in it's league. It seamlessly blends the use of 2-D and CGI animations while staying true to the manga's original style. On that note, the adaptation does the manga justice. The characters are as expressive as they are on the pages and they don't lose any of their charms.
I can't wait to see where this series leads!",8,ohayo1

                Demon Slayer Review *Spoiler Free*
Plot: Nice plot, fast paced and to the point with almost no useless stalling. Nothing outstanding but really engaging and has a lot of future potential.
Characters: Limited variety of characters, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but most of the focus is being directed on the protagonist and negligible character development for all the characters, a bit disappointing.
World Building: Pretty good, nothing outstanding. Scale wise it's good enough.
Animation: Probably some of the best visuals I've witnessed in the history of Anime.
Music: Awesome music choice for specific situations and moments throughout. The opening and closing songs by Lisa were a blast
                  too.
Impact: The anime is filled with all kinds of emotions, filled with instances of motivation, inspiration and sometimes silly comedies, there scenes can prove tear jerking.",7,arthur_fleckUwU

                The meat of my criticism relies on the story section. Once you read it, you'll quickly understand why I recommend AVOIDING this show.
Art: 10/10, perfectly done.
Good old art style, no gradual shading. Today's day and age desperately needs more of this because sometimes, less is more and it's refreshing to see something different yet classic. Beautiful colors. Few cheap tricks during the animation.Sound: 8/10, carried on Nezuko's shoulders.
Nezuko's voice is outstanding. Unfortunately, she's the only one. The others are good. The music was forgettable. The sound effects were decent.
Character: 5/10, a very imbalanced mix.
The main character, Tanjirou, is likable, very much so. His love for his family is apparent and that translates well into his visible devotion towards them.
The duality of his sister Nezuko made me root hard for her! I love her struggle and seeing her sometimes overcome it. She also has cute moments. She's my favorite.
The antagonist, Muzen, is shrouded in mystery. Yet, he seems powerful. Props to the show for managing both at the same time.
The rest of the cast is a big failure. Some characters are intended to be classic. Such as the lone trainer with an oni mask. However, the lack of both effort and creativity put into them makes them nothing more than a shadow of a trope.
On top of that, we're skimming through the various arcs of the series, not letting the viewer share enough time with the secondary cast to get attached to them. So, even if a character has an interesting potential, in the end it's not exploited enough to matter.
An example of that are non-manichean characters, whose alignment isn't clear. Especially not initially.
Story: 2/10, a promising premise immediately cast aside.
The first episode made a big impression on me. I fell in love with it and instantly recommended the show.
However, this anime pulled the single BIGGEST, RUDEST, most SHAMELESS bait & switch I have EVER bore witness to! Bar none! And I've watched a lot of anime in my days as you can see in my profile.
I'm not even saying that on the heat of the moment. I had time to cool down, I watched it when it first aired. I'm calm and collected, not exaggerating.
We're made to think Nezuko will have a predominant role and presence in the show. But she's forsaken as soon as episode 2 drops! Never to be of any significance again until a handful of episodes later, where she shines only for a brief moment!
Not only that! The adventures of our hero are sometimes bland. I suffered through a couple of episodes. Little progression was felt.
Enjoyment: 1/10, pathetic.
Natural transition: even when little progression was felt, definitely no engagement was had.
Although I was more than ready to forgive the show after being baited into it and it bamboozled me, I was EAGER to forgive it; this anime gave me no reason to do so.
Initially smartly written, it's evident the author rapidly quit caring. He either ran out of motivation or just was incapable of keeping it up.

                Anime shounen beating and Ufotable, what could go wrong? Exactly, NOTHING! Kimetsu no Yaiba is the best example of how an anime with a simple and predictable script can be leveraged to horrors with an absurd visual production and impeccable direction (especially in the action parts), the anime greatly improves the original material, not only in the scenes of action but also in the quieter parts, using a lot of the setting with the sun setting or with Sakuras, but what caught my attention most in the production besides that was the perfect use of 3D and 2D in battles, it's amazing how they manage
                  to synchronize that so perfectly at the time of battles, you don't even know if it's being 3D or 2D, it's so well done, another point worth mentioning is the effects on the characters' powers, which are very beautiful and well done, the production of this anime is simply impeccable in all respects.
Now talking about the story, as I said before, it's no big deal and it's very simple, although it's far from bad, all the characters have their charisma and importance in the work, in addition to the designs of each one being very creative, in the Overall I really liked the work, and I hope to see more of it with Ufotable's Amazing Adaptation, which is for sure the best anime studio in terms of action and battles.",8,Joaomar007

                Demon Slayer has been the focus of the ""mainstream"" battle for quite a bit. It is definitely the top anime next to My Hero Academia and SnK as the gateway show to get new people, especially westerners, into the anime world. People praise its art style, characters, and story greatly and consider it one of the greats of the anime universe. Many people I have seen also consider it their personality traits such as can be seen in the Harry Potter Universe or fans of astrological signs.
While there is nothing bad about liking a ""mainstream"" anime, and it is definitely good to see the anime
                  community growing, and to have anime for the less hardcore of fans, it does not really mean that the anime is altogether good just because it is popular, for example, FMAB is considered the top anime and is definitely one of my favorites, however, it is not without its own flaws.
So where does KnY fall into this rant? Well, ""mainstream"" and art can only get you so far, or should only get you so far, in my opinion. KnY does indeed look pretty and is a good shy-away from this one style fits all base art style that every anime these days has been using, that's about the only one of two things this anime has going for it. The anime is a shounen and as such is very closely follows the shounen story plot elements and development to a T, it does not shy away at all. From the training arc going not as planned, to the power of love and friendship, or in this case sibling-bond. There is nothing unique about this anime.
Its plot is not the only place where I really see this anime falling flat either, my biggest issue is honestly with its characters. Ranging from just plain annoying to tiresome, I couldn't get attached to, feel for, or generally, even like any of the main characters. There were some points throughout the story that took me as a surprise with the main character, such as his willingness to attack his archrival in the middle of the street, in the crowd, which truly did show his anger at his circumstances, but that's about it. The main character of the show is the exact same as any other modern shounen character, he's forced into the world one way or another, starts off as a crybaby, and then throughout the story toughens up and starts acting more like a hero, the character development is as basic as it can be. They tried throwing the characters up by having a dude wear a boar mask and another only fight while he's asleep but at the end of the day it's just the exact same as the generic angry character and the perverted character, the Bakugo and Minoru combo. Nezuko is just the Baby Yoda of the show, everywhere and annoying.
Earlier in my review, I did say there was one more element in the show I enjoyed and there was but to be honest; it was simply a single line of dialogue that got me intrigued. The world-building of KnY is simply okay, there was one line a character said along the lines of ""Slayers are a dying profession and are not really considered an actual respected profession now, most people don't even believe in Demons"". This one line interested me more than the entire anime and I believe that if they did more with this one line, the anime would have been a lot more interesting to me. If they had gone for a more mature overall theme and played on this line, I feel as if the anime could have been something special if done right.
At the end of the day, KnY was enjoyable and not really that bad but it is far from anything special. The hype and popularity around this anime really astounds me, especially people who say it's the best thing ever and unique, when everything in it has been done countless times before. If you want to watch it go ahead, it's worth its weight in hours but it's far from something that I would say has rewatch potential.

                *This is a spoiler free review*
When Kamado Tanjiro's family is slaughtered by demons and his little sister is turned into one, he must find a way to cure her by joining the Demon  Slayer  Corps,  whose  sole  mission  is  to  slay  demons. 
First  off,  the  animation  is  superb. 10/10. It  is  what  pulled  me  into  this  anime  in  the  first  place.  The masterful  colours  contrasted  with  the  surrounding  darkness  captivates  you.
                  And yes, there will be a lot of darkness because the demos come out only at night. So while you may need to crank up your brightness from time to time, the animation alone makes it one  of  the  best  anime  of  2019.  Hats  off  to  Ufotable. But  the  other  aspects…  they're  kind  of  meh. 
Although the show is a  typical  shounen,  I  really  liked  that  the  author  made  the  protagonist  sensitive. Typically,  shounen  heroes  are  all  wild,  eternally  hungry  and  overall  stupid,  so  this  was  a welcome  change  for  me. But  as  for  the  other  characters,  they  are  all  fairly  standard,  and  I was  not  surprised  at  most  of the  developments.  If  you've  been  watching  anime  for  some  time,  you'll  be  able to  predict  the characters'  personalities  too.  There's  the  typical  woman  chasing  simp,  the  always-ready-to-fight wild  guy,  the  quiet  but  awkward  strong  guy,  and  so  on. But  all of  this standing,  I  will  have  to  appreciate  the  design  of  the  characters.  All  demons  feel different,  have  different  powers  and  generally  make  you  feel  excited  for  the  battle  that  is  about to  go  down. But  the  battles  themselves  are…  meh.  While  they  are  beautifully  animated,  on  the  second watch,  you  realise  that  the  pizzaz  is  only  cursory  and  that there  is  not  much  substance  to  it.  The fights  happen  in  typical  shounen  fashion,  with  the  characters  busting  out  a  new  move  or remembering  the  precious  bond  with  their  siblings.  The  latter  doesn't  happen  too  frequently, thank  god. But  what  I  think  they really missed  out  on  was  the  horror  aspect.  
The  demon  reveals  itself.  The  chilly background  music  sets  in  as  Tanjiro  grabs  his  sword,  a  bead  of  sweat  running  down  his forehead. 
And  then  the  battle  music  starts,  ruining  the  buildup.  As  they  have  already  included some  gore  in  the  form  of  blood,  and  some  designs  of  the  demons  are  horrific,  i  think  that  a horror  theme  would've  been  more  suiting,  rather  than  the  light  comedy  they  went  for. The  comedy,  though,  is  rather  hit-or-miss.  It  is  mainly  based  on  character  quirks,  and  becomes stale  after  a  while. 
Where  the  story  shines  through  is  when  the  stories  of  the  demons  are  told. As  Tanjiro  puts  it,  ""They  are  a  troubled  existence!""  and tries  to  put them  at  peace  with themselves.  This  would've  been  the  best  part of  the  anime,  if  not  for  the  amount  of  sadness forced  down  our  throats.  The  fact  that  I bingewatched  it  might  have  something  to  do  with  this, but  it  felt  like  we  were  constantly  listening  to  sad  stories  and  it  became  grating  after  a  while.  It's like  they  are  forcing  you  to  feel  bad  for  the  demon  and  that felt suffocating. Story: 6/10
Another  thing  I  really  liked  about  the  anime  was  the  background  music.  The  themes  suit  the characters  and  the  occasion  very  well  and  really  manages  to  amp  up  the  feeling  of  battle. They are a mixture of Japanese and Western music, and the music styles blend together really well. Hats off to the music directors. I also really enjoyed the opening, it just felt right and the ending song was quite good as well, but I don't think I heard it more than twice as I was eager to move onto the next episode. One of the episodes has a different ending, which is more traditional, and is really good. Music: 9/10
 The  pacing  of  the  story  is  good,  but  the  initial  slow  burning  nature  of  the anime  may  deter  people from  watching  more  than  the  first  4-5  episodes  which  are  training  and  stuff-which  I  personally enjoy-but  most  people  don't. The real meat of the story begins after that.
Overall,  it is  a  solid  shounen  anime,  with  extraordinary  animation,  some  good  moments  and overall  okay-ish  story. People  who  have  recently  started  watching  anime  will  enjoy  it  a  lot  more  than  the  people  who have  been  watching  for  some  time. I  just  hope  that  the  upcoming  movie  and  new  seasons  amp  up  the  story  factor  as  well  as  the worldbuilding,  which  I  felt  was  lackluster  in  this  season.",7,iam21

                SUMMARY: Shonen medium generic but reliable.
Kimetsu No Yaiba is an anime that is definitely not my type, fighting shonen are not the kind of stories that I personally look for when watching an anime, so I have mixed feelings.
WARNING: Probably my little taste for the shonen is reaping me and probably from a distant opinion of reality.
If I can say something good about this anime, it is that I like its character design and the design of its world, I really feel in an ancient Japan, apart from that I can also say that the combat system catches my attention, it is really interesting ,
                  the fights are good in terms of animation but they are not the best fights that I have been able to witness.
Despite everything I said, I did not like this anime, I feel that its characters are somewhat flat and that they are there only to fulfill their role and only that, they do not try to reach the viewer with a message or reflection, or something similar.
Another bad thing to note that mainly caused me a lot of noise, was that they extend very unnecessarily in the past of the villains, sometimes they are executed correctly but there are other times when they are not.
In general, everything seems very meh to me, and honestly, I only finished it because I saw it accompanied by someone who had more enthusiasm for the anime and the genre.
RESUMEN: Shonen medio generico pero cumple con su trabajo.
Kimetsu No Yaiba es un anime que definitivamente no es mi tipo, los shonen de pelea no son el tipo de historias que yo personalmente busco al ver un anime, por lo que tengo sentimientos encontrados.
ADVERTENCIA:Probablemente mi poco gusto por los shonen me este segando y probablemente de una opinion lejana de la realidad.
Si puedo decir algo bueno de este anime es que me gusta su diseño de personajes y el diseño de su mundo, realmente me siento en un japon antiguo, fuera de eso tambien puedo decir que me llama la atencion el sistema de combates, realmente es interesante, las peleas son buenas en cuanto animacion pero no son las mejores peleas que e podido presenciar.
A pesar de todo lo que dije no me gusto este anime, siento que sus personajes son algo planos y que estan ahí solo para cumplir su rol y solo eso, no intentan llegar al espectador con un mensaje o reflexion, o algo parecido.
Otra cosa mala a destacar que principalmente me causo mucho ruido, fue que se extienden muy innescesarimente en el pasado de los villanos,a veces esto se ejecuta de manera correcta pero hay otras ocasiones en las que no.
En general me parece todo muy meh, y sinceramente solo lo termine porque lo vi acompañado de alguien que si tenia más entusiasmo por el anime y el genero.",6,Calviciecalvicia

                Thisd is one of those things where I will never ever in a million years understand the hype around. Typically when a bad anime has a lot of hype, there's alot of cute girls or there's an interesting plot point, an interesting character interaction, just SOMETHING.
[Spoilers, sorry]
Nezuko, the best character, is rarely in the show, that is my main and biggest complaint, she is the most interesting and fun to watch character, and she spends 90% of it inside of a backpack. The first season is absolutely horrific when it comes to characters. The two side kicks, were by far the most annoying characters I
                  have ever seen in my 15 years of watching anime. I had a headache after every episode. 
The pacing, oh my lord the pacing, wow. Is the pacing an absolute slap in the face. This anime could've been pretty good, if it was shortened to 12 episodes (and....frankly had less screaming). The pacing was something I hope I never have to endure ever again. It would go so slow, like one fight going on for 4 to 6 episodes, and discussions that would go on for 2-3 episodes. The story would take a massive screeching halt to focus on whatever mind numbingly boring nonsense where they would just dump exposition on me. 
The spider family OH the spider effing family, what a nightmare. I thought this was just going to be another long drawn out fight, turns out no, this is an entire arc of two characters yelling back and forth for two whole episodes with random flash backs to the spider guys life that I did not care about at all. There was one interesting moment of one of the demons switching back to her original self, and then caught by spider boy who forces her to turn back into her mother figure, which i found very cool and creative.
But as a whole here's a break down:
Characters: boring and uninteresting at best, infuriating and annoying at worse
Sound design: Very bland, opening song not very good
Voice acting: Noticeably horrible and admittedly embarrassing (except for shinobu)
Art: i mean, it's different, but not very pleasing the way they draw hair is distracting and ugly
Pacing: horrific and the worst i've seen in my entire life 
Story: it's ok, it's definitely not the worst but completely over shadowed by poor pacing
If you're into waifus, this is not for you, if you are into incredibly fight scenes this is not for you, if you're into developing character interactions this is not for you, if you like deep and developing story lines this is not for you, if you are into husbandos then...maybe, maybe this ones for you. 
In the end this anime was a chore, it was painful and annoying. The best it got was at certain moments i'd go ""huh, thats cool i guess"". It was a boring diaster, and i worry for everyones mental health as to why they liked this.",4,pollyspocket

“Nezuko… Nezuko… NEZUKO!!!” – Tanjiro Kamado.
Well, at least Eren from Attack on Titans (Shingeki no Kyojin) had a good reason to shout at those Titans. He made sense in destroying them, which would’ve been a benevolent job. But yeah, sister love, ahem… affection for your sister will do.
I didn’t mean to pry on the personal relationship between protagonist Tanjiro Kamado and his sister Nezuko, who had a hard time when a demon devoured the rest of their family, whilst leaving Nezuko somehow alive, only to become a demon. Well, life’s hard ain’t it? Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is a manga written and
                  illustrated by author Koyoharu Gotouge, which is being published in the famous Japanese magazine, Weekly Shonen Jump that has been responsible for the publication of some the world’s most popular mangas. The best examples include the famous Dragon Ball series, One Piece, and Naruto, which had shaken the world with their popularity.
The illustrated content of Kimetsu no Yaiba (KnY) has been adapted by the animation studio, Ufotable, which had released its anime in 2019. And it was a major hit amongst countless numbers of anime that were telecasted in the year. As a matter of fact, it was mentioned that KnY’s annual sales had surpassed that of the manga One Piece, which had been ruling sales every year for more than a decade. The anime was a big factor in boosting manga sales, but was it really that great?
After a lot of hype, I finally completed the first season of the anime. And guess what? It was pretty good. Animation and cinematography were top-notch with those twisting camera angles over various layouts. Music was great, especially the opening theme 'Gurenge' by LiSA. But there was one thing that felt missing. Story depth and witty complexity. Okay, I’ll understand if most people are against this, but unlike some of the other shows from the year, I’d pretty much say that KnY is for anime-starters, or for people who’d be considered as weebs. I mean, what was the big deal? I have grown watching hell lot of Shonen anime and KnY wasn’t that awesome as everyone gestured. If anyone’s asking for gore and blood, there’s Attack on Titans (AoT) from 2019, if you want music, there’s Hiroyuki Sawano’s score continued in the same show, if you want a better story, there’s Dr. Stone and AoT and of course the amazing One Piece (though really slow-paced in the anime right now) that’s been running since 1999 (these are just some personal examples. If you have anything more anime in your mind, please let it known in the comments).
I’m not here to condescend KnY, but instead implying that there were overall better anime. Japan’s anime industry is very fond of demons and swordsmen, and they never run out of those ideas. I mean, KnY is not the first demon-slaying anime in a while. But on contrary to most of the others, KnY has done a better job in the genre. It also provided relief against the great flood of Isekai anime. But at the end of the day, I may say that viewing tastes are deteriorating over the years.
I looked around regarding KnY’s popularity to which I’d found that ‘Small Nezuko’ was a big factor in bringing in a lot of audience through the character’s appeal. As I had mentioned, visual effects were really great, but that alone doesn’t determine a good show. Just compare, Castle of Cagliostro (1979) to that of Children of the Sea (2019). Both the anime films were released forty years apart, with significant animation differences. But in the end, Cagliostro was a masterpiece whereas, the latter was a big mess.
Kimetsu no Yaiba is a good anime that was released in 2019, but not close to the best unless the dedicated followers, the so-called ‘weebs’ might disagree and start a cultist protest. I mean no offense with this review, but want to make the point, people must understand that cute girls and flashy moves aren’t everything. There’s more to a better anime.

                I'm not really much of a shounen watcher so take my word for what it's worth but I really enjoyed Demon Slayer.
I usually don't worry about power leveling until the end, but I was really curious as to how they would expand the powers of the protagonist throughout the show. With enemies having such diverse forms of attack, how would they step up? The forms were beautiful to see however, and I really loved the animations for most of the fights. CGI could be pretty off putting depending on when it appeared. It was jarring if it appeared around or in fights, but outside of
                  that I usually didn't mind. However, the animation served in great service to the story. Each character, their story, and style feels unique from the ground up. The distinct differences in the main three characters really highlights the humanity they have and their difference from most demons. Additionally, just having a demon sister isn't for fanservice, but honestly has heartfelt moments with the dedication of the protagonist to save his sister's soul and life. While I can't say some moments didn't feel predictable, I enjoyed my romp through the backstory and world they crafted. A mash of old style samurai themes and new technology, the show offers a lot to keep me intersted, and I honestly hope that a Season 2 comes around soon.",7,AmericanSomnium

                This anime is what i called a overated and underrated anime, it is overated by the one who love it and underated by the one who hate it
So i will dissected it to see what made it tick and not. This review doesn’t contain SPOILERS.
The story to me is ok it is better than your avarage anime but not as great as to be call a masterpiece
The character is what make it tick and not because why most character are outstandingly like able, unique and as a whole, great but it is because of that it is often annoying when people talk about it.
The animation
                  and sound, what do you think, this is the same studio that gave us fate/zero, it can’t be under 9/10
Though a really great show, it is overrated it is not the best ever and not everyone who doesn’t watch it have bad taste. And this is also why this show is hated, because of the communities, some people because of the the communities just give it a 1 and say it is awful",7,SamTHK

                I'd heard about this show being nicely animated but being weak in story, and due to popularity I decided to check it out. It does have nice animation, but the action is surprisingly mediocre. The unimpressive action coupled with it not really having much in the way of emotional stakes (thanks to the characters and pacing) made it disappointing at times. In regards to pacing, the fundamental magic system of the world (ie, breathing) was pretty much glossed over and appeared out of nowhere after the MC (Tanjiro) used it. Only after some others used their own unique breathing I realized it was a fundamental
                  thing for demon slayers, like Nen in HxH. The lack of explanation for breathing and its styles was... certainly a choice, though a poor one. I actually think the world and the story are okay, even though it is a bit of a stretch for me to believe wider society doesn't know about demons. What I consider to be a big failure are the show's characters. Tanjiro is a stock shonen MC and is serviceable, so there's nothing inherently wrong with him; Nezuko, his sister, puts a more unique edge to both the story and the MC though she is sidelined for the majority of the show; as for the others, they're hit or miss. And there are a lot of misses. I'll address the worst of them in a separate paragraph, though to name a few there's the boar mask dude whose entire character is simply being competitive, there's the crow who screams, there's a demon whose only personality is that he likes another demon, and there's the majority of the Hashira. The Hashira aren't that bad since they're all shown in one or two episodes, though they're mostly a cliche group of eccentric characters (eg, there's a forgetful one, there's a perpetually crying one, and there's one who finds just about anything attractive). Shinobu is an exception, and at least has a reason for being/appearing perpetually chipper. Overall, the show is below average.
Zenitsu is the worst character I've ever seen in any anime. I don't know why he exists, I wish he didn't exist, he is just inexcusable. The pacing is already a bit slow, but he was a huge distraction and almost made me drop the show. I think the thing about the show in general is that it sucks at comedy. Just about everything that's likely meant to be silly or humorous is a distraction or annoying. And that's all Zenitsu's character is. He's awful.",4,TangyAbleOrange

                For the story, i have no complain to this. I very like the story and the concept behind it. The plot is not to fast and to slow too. Every episode have a progress to the end of the story.
For the art and animation, this is look very good. The fighting scenes look epic and awesome. The background scene is look nice too. It has a unique artstyle with bold outline in the character that make it unique.
For the sound, the sound effect in battle or fighting scene make the anime feels alive. The song, either the opening song, ending song, or backsound song is
                  build up the feeling correctly in this anime.
Sometimes I feel bored, but I always found something again that I need to complete this anime. Overall 8,5 for me.",9,AphroditeZ

                Ah yes,Demon Slayer.Biggest hit anime of the decade.It isn't as good as people say it is.It isn't terrible,but certainly not a masterpiece.
Story (7)
How did Tanjiro ignore the existence of demons all the way up till his family was massacred.Like bruh?
I personally feel the story is a little slow,I don't feel like wanting to watch more than 6 episodes at a time,kinda tiring,I guess?
But it's nice how they give the slained demons a sad story,like even fucking spider boy murderer made me cry.
I can't find any massive pros nor cons,give it a 7.Art (8)
I really like the art style.One of the best I have seen.Character designs are great.
Only problem I have is the 'comedic' and exaggerated faces,same problem as Full Metal Alchemist,inserting humour into the worst of places.One second they are serious next second they look retarded.I would've much preferred a more subtle approach.
Sound (9)
The opening song sounds very good.
There are also high quality earrapes of it on youtube,very nice.
Character (6)
Not counting the demons cause they pop up for 1 or 2 episodes then get killed by Tanijiro and the gang.
Tanjiro
-He is hardworking,kind,and...Uh...Hey siri what else?
Tanjiro really isn't that interesting,just your stereotypical good boy protagonist with some plot armour.
Nezuko
-Run around in tiny form,immediate waifu of the year.
Zenitsu
-Pussy that claps ass with lightning
Inosuke
-Peppa and George's long lost brother.
Not interesting.No development.

                Demon Slayer is an extraordinarily basic yet fairly enjoyable anime that has been all over everywhere for the past 3 years now. Renowned for its spectacular animation, it deliveres a story that, while fairly enjoyable, does leave something to be desired in some ways.
The characters of Demon Slayer are all quite simple, but some of them are enjoyable to watch. Tanjiro is a vanilla and simple kindhearted protagonist that, while shallow, does have enjoyable interactions with most of the cast and is difficult to hate.
Nezuko is eh, she serves mostly as a tired cuteness pinata, and has a personality that could easily be replaced by
                  that of a dog. I will admit that she is indeed cute though, and thus mildly entertaining to watch
Inosuke is very simple but very entertaining to watch, the hot-headed moron archetype works fine on simpler characters and I found Inosuke to be about the best character in the series so far. 
Zenitsu is an insufferable cowardly pervert with no redeeming qualities and easily the worst part of the show for me. I understand it is likely that they will be further develoiped in the future, but he comes across as far too unlikeable in the early parts of the series to the point where I'm not rooting for him to improve.
Demon Slayer's art does live up to the hype, however. Ufotable utilizes CGI effectivley, not coming off as clunky like it does in other anime and allowing for more detailed enviroments. Movement is animated very dynamically, allowing for exciting fight scenes that make up for what I personally believe to be a subpar power system.
Overall, Demon Slayer is a decent anime that is entertaining as long as you don't think about it too hard and just watch the pretty fights.",7,Gengar_94

                !! Has spoilers
Unsatisfying cons
- Some annoying characters who love to scream for whatever reason
- Expanding on the previous point, their demeanour is unpleasant for the amount of screen time devoted to their fuckery, and it reflects on the enjoyment in a bad way
- Many interesting characters lack depth in favour of the ""sibling bond"" narrative (which I feel like it could be toned down a notch, at least in the anime version)
I also wish the demons' past didn't only appear as death flashbacks to justify their misgivings as humans, but had more significance to it. The watcher is not given reason give a shit or
                  find those flashbacks interesting at all, but regardless they are still a recurring theme throughout the series.
Aside from very remarkable points, Kimetsu no Yaiba gorgeous to watch and engaging to follow. As I always say, any deviation from the usual shonen MC immature crybaby is welcome; Tanjiro's level-headedness and sensibility truly makes you want to root for his success as a hard-worker.",8,resolritter

                A show that took the anime community and changed it completely, with fans taking sides; either lovers or haters of this new shounen. I will try to keep this as critical and unbiased as possible, which is quite hard.
Story: Extremely stereotypical with few redeeming factors. The setting, protagonist's motivation, fights... Nothing is new here. And worst of all, there are some severe asspulls in certain episodes which feel very underwhelming for the viewer. I must say, though, the manga gets better.
Art: Kimetsu no Yaiba has received most of its praise from the quality of animation, but I must disagree. While the backgrounds and camera movements
                  are worked flawlessly, the characters don't fit at all with it. They almost feel like a cardboard cutout in front of a real landscape. Visuals aren't just about quality, also consistency. And this show doesn't have that. The visual effects in fights are satisfying to watch, though. Considering this, I'll give it a 7, but I'm a bit unsure.
Sound: The soundtrack is overall good, although it still gets caught with most other stereotypical soundtracks. Some of them are way overhyped by fans, which just contributes to disappointment. It's not bad at all, in fact, I gave it an 8 because some songs were quite enjoyable.
Characters: Again, coming to the stereotypes. It's what this show suffers the most about. The main character may be kind, but this is a whole another level. It even feels frustrating at times. And other characters get nearly no attention in the anime.
Overall enjoyment: After all the hype, this show was very underwhelming. Most of it was another stereotypical adventure, but still enjoyable regardless. The main character is extremely annoying and unrelatable, at least to me, and some major fights are won through unjustified asspulls, which are probably the worst thing a writer can do. In short, overrated but still good.",7,MateoK

                What can I say the first season is amazing because of its way of introducing the series as a whole rather than be the opening hyping up the Tanjiro and Nezuko story journey or the other characters. The swinging sounds of the characters using their weapons is quite and satisfying to the ears same can go for things like breaking sounds and etc. Another thing worth pointing out was the animation was amazing there was little to no model moments because the artist keeps it very constant and fluid. If there were to be a complaint, I would give it is that the personalities seem
                  to feel shoehorned sometimes to describe it more it's like they have a certain trait than the show just used that trait over and over. Even this however may not seem like a problem to others so take it with a grain of salt. The main characters Personity is not as cliché as I expected it to be Tanjiro is a kind person and is willing to help but when it comes to demons (expectation Nezuko) he is willing to kill them. Making us the audience does not have to see a will he, won't he? conflict all of the time at least in this season. The story is simple yet enjoyable if there's another anime, I could compare it to it would be the Full metal alchemist series both having siblings trying to survive in a dark world while also trying to turn one back to normal. Back on topic the series doesn't try to make anything to out of the box again sister and brother thing however it accepts and instead adds good side elements the are intriguing to the story as well the viewers. Overall Demon slayer season 1 is great in terms of a first step let alone in total because of its amazing art,sound,chracters,enjoyment,and it's not new be enjoyable story.",9,C4sky

                [Warning, this review may contain minor spoilers]
Kimetsu's start at Yaiba was very weak and predictable. I believe it was a bad start for such a spectacular anime! They wanted to impress viewers as soon as the story started. But I didn't really feel bad for Tanjiro's family, because I didn't have enough time to empathize with her. It was really a very quick, instantaneous thing. So I misjudged Kimetsu: ""a sensationalist anime with tragic cliché scenes"". And my friends, I regret very much for thinking so.
Anyway, I decided to leave that aside and continue the story. The sibling relationship between Nezuko and Tanjiro is a
                  beautiful and genuine one, both characters being very admirable. And the author did not force incest between them, it filled me with happiness! As I got to know the soundtrack, I couldn't think of anything other than that it is FANTASTIC (I specifically love the melody that appeared in episode 19). The art is very peculiar, it shows us characters with really authentic appearances and the animation is superb, that is undeniable. One of the things that really irritated me, however, was the constant gender discussion that I had to put up with (when Sabito came out, he started a speech justifying that whoever was born a man cannot cry and blablabla, like that like the Rui, who said that the father has a role, and the mother another. My loved ones, stop talking shit. Truly annoying).
But that is really an irrelevant part of the anime, because everything else pays off. I must praise how Tanjiro's training happened. He trained for a LOT of time, and even after so long, he was still weak. I found this extremely realistic. And man, he's an enlightened, merciful being, a character who immediately became one of my top 10 anime characters. In addition, he was also very authentic and confident in front of the other four in the selection test; he is a boy who is not afraid to express himself. And you see, Oni are extremely hateful, disgusting, cruel (at least, most of them). And yet the damn author managed to make me cry horribly because of them. I also have to mention the comedy scenes. Inosuke, like Tanjiro, became one of my favorite characters hahah. By the way, in my opinion, the story only improved when the three stooges got together (those who watched know what I'm talking about hahah). 
The characters in general have a VERY creative power, and the control of breathing immediately sparked my interest (this is because I do meditation). Tanjiro, as said before, shows mercy to the villains. And I identify with him! Because of that, I always felt out of place among my friends; they are very pleased to see the villain die, but I no... I have a tight in my heart. I feel sad, very hurt ... I wanted to give these corrupted beings at least a second chance to live. Just to finish: I didn't expect Kimetsu no Yaiba to have such violent scenes, it excited me a lot. But I confess that I'm even more excited for the movie!

                I hate shonens.
Yet i loved this show.
Go into this without any expectations and just enjoy it for what it is.
While this universe has some lore to it, you only follow the main character on his quest and receive lore bits as they come. Its not overly convoluted, and its not too simple. Some people like to reduce this show down to ""its all about the animation"" but no, its much more than that.
No spoiler review:
Here we are given a story about a person bent on fixing something that is wrong. Its framed almost like revenge, but its more altruistic than that. Its very classic in
                  its samurai film tone, and really plays up the tropes of an Akira Kurosawa film. There are many shots of lone swordsman surrounded by nature that evoke the same imagery. Swords swing and water effects gather around the blade like Hokusai paintings (the famous tsunami wave). When people engage in a fight, everything slows down right at the moment it starts; the frame is filled with movement and detail, and then in a flash its over but becomes bittersweet. We are often treated to backstory that humanizes the villains and you see how tragic they are. Its sad when they die, and this show really knows how to make you feel empathy for them. 
This show takes place during the Meiji period; an exciting time rarely seen. The country sides are still very undeveloped and traditional, but the cities are getting basic electricity and trains which is new, confusing, and exciting to the main cast. Between the historical elements, the Kurosawa and Hokusai inspired imagery and tone, and other traditional elements, this show is refreshingly inspired by classic Japanese culture.
Also, there are stakes. Great stakes. Main characters could lose a limb or die in seemingly random moments without warning. There doesn't seem to be plot armor protecting the protagonists often. During the action, anyone could get very hurt, die, and every attack is rather unique so you are at the edge of your seat. The villains have JoJo-stand type abilities which is fun too. 
Definitely give this a try; even if you dislike shonens.",10,kenkubus

I gave this show a 6/10 but it is not ""Fair"" it is the definition of mediocre.  However mediocre on MAL is not 5 but 6 so I gave it a 6. Now Why is it mediocre? Pretty simple: 
KIMETSU NO YAIBA is not an organic show. It feels like a committee job. Like, think about 5 average people who read biggest shonen hits of the 2000s and decided to copy paste parts of it. It feels so fucking unnatural. Story beats are unnatural, dialogue is unnatural, fights (all the powers/techniques/enemy designs etc.) feels unnatural, humor feels unnatural. What do
                  I mean? It feels like the product of a brainstorming session, it feels like the product of a machine learning algorithm. It is like they decided that the MC should meet the villain early because that is a trope, have a companion who is a whiny bitch all the time because that is a trope, MC needs to save a girl by smiling at her because that is a trope. Even the character designs are all products of tropes. Humor placement seems like an AI program decided to put humor bits in the story because it does not look like a sane person did. It feels like those ""fellow kids"" memes you see from corporate twitters. It is like ""Pokemon Go To The Polls""",6,sk8erbyern

                Vampire Slayer is rather by-the-books, but does it very well. It's an anime about our protagonists joining a demon hunting organization and, well, hunting demons. As such, there's plenty of training and fighting. If you're looking for an anime with good fights, look no further. To help, the animation in (and out) of them is stellar, so every fight really leaves an impact. Literally, as injuries are taken into account to boot.
I don't think there was a demon fight that wasn't unique and cool thanks to their designs and abilities. As a result, the fights are captivating, and I found they went on for just
                  as long as they needed to. A lot of demons are also given backstories as to why they became what they did, which I'm a sucker for. 
However, there's one demon that's the Big Bad, which I find diminishes how interesting demons could've been. Instead of demons having their own motives, most we see just work under him. He's the only one with the special ability to turn humans into demons instead of it being a thing all demons have, which would've made them cooler. Plus, as far as villains go, he's not unique and more ""quiet cool guy who sends lackeys to do his work"". I would've preferred the plot's attention to focus solely on finding out how to cure Nezuko, but instead taking down the leader demon takes the center stage as the motive and suffers from it a bit.
Furthermore, a plot element requires demon parts to be studied to help find a cure for Nezuko...then ends up barely showing up and only being for ""high level"" demons. It would've been neat if the protagonists had to balance killing the demons and making sure to get parts in all fights, but they end up just killing them instead. This whole thing is then completely forgotten about by the time they do fight a high level demon, which made me sad.
While Nezuko, the demon girl the plot revolves around, has her moments in battle, she gets a disappointing amount of screentime. The bond between her and her brother is talked about and showcased at times, but I often found myself forgetting she existed. If you're looking at this anime hoping that this demon and her brother will be doing a lot of tag-team fighting, you'll be left wanting (especially when battles with her are so cool). Likewise, not a lot goes into how Nezuko's curious condition works, which I was also disappointed by since she's such an anomaly.
As for the other characters, the main protagonist Tanjiro is saved from being your humdrum motivated/smart fighter by being a very Good Boy. For some reason he has a very good sense of smell, which can be dumb at times (like ""I can smell trust on her"") but also works well. He's left with his sister for around half the anime until the blonde-haired Zinitsu joins. I really don't like Zenitsu. His great design is ruined by being a loud complainer ALL THE TIME and always harassing women (just bordering being a perv character but not quite). He's a part of The Main Three, so he very often ruins scenes. Thankfully, the boar-headed Inosuke's temper and competitiveness make him very funny (and my favorite). The supporting characters are very good as well. Demon Slayer doesn't take itself seriously all the time, leading to a lot of fun and quirky character moments.
I haven't read the manga, but there points in the anime where I really felt like something was cut. A character will refer to something that wasn't shown as if it was, leaving me to imply ""Oh, that was probably done/fleshed out in the manga."" The most egregious is Tanjiro suddenly using ""water art"" techniques as his main fighting style despite his training never involving them. It's not like you'll get lost, but it does leave me wondering if the manga is the way to go. 
...But the beautiful fight animation and soundtrack make me not so sure.
Hands down my favorite thing about Demon Slayer is its use of 3D CG for distant characters. I despise how distant characters in anime look like they're suddenly made of melted clay with minimal features, so this method of dealing with it made me really happy. Of course, it's not perfect in all the ways 3D CG isn't, but I hope it becomes a standard thing.
The end of Demon Slayer doesn't even attempt to wrap anything up since there's so much more story, so the question is ""How hyped are you for the next season?"" I think my answer is ""Moderately."" My time with it definitely was enjoyable thanks to good characters (except Zenitsu) and cool fights. However, the overall execution of the plot and story beats aren't unique enough for it to stand out in my mind...which makes the commitment that's going to be required seem tiring. If you're interested and like good fights, I'd definitely watch it. If you want to watch it solely because it's popular, I don't think you're missing as much as it seems.",7,Chrismas95

                Good finale to a great show. Demon slayer proves that you don't need to writer a revolutionary plot deconstructing every trope and cliche. People are fine with the same cookie cutter style as long as it's executed well. Ufotable takes it to the next level with their spectacular animation, OST, and directing.
There was never an episode that i felt bored, forcing my way through it. That doesn't mean demon slayer doesn't have it's flaws. They're painfully obvious if you're used to your everyday shounen. The MC (Tanjiro) is actually what i dislike the most; his overly-chivalrous personality puts me off. The rest of cast suffers
                  from one note trope personalities as well.
However looking past the cliche issues, everything else in demon slayer is amazing.
I highly recommend it to any anime fan, especially shounen fans. 8/10",8,TheRantMan321

                NOTE: this review is for my own personal use only. i've noticed after a while, i forget why i rated a show highly or poorly, so i'm going to write reviews after completing each series so i can reference them in the future.
~~~
i'm pretty conflicted for my rating on this show. while i do enjoy shounen shows, i find that they're all pretty cookie cutter. the main characters in more recent shows always start as a ""normal"" person who isn't all that powerful but acquires their power through dedication and constant training. the MC always cries. they'll face certain hardships or experience some trauma that
                  makes them cry and it's remembering this event that will give them strength later on. the main conflict is always good vs. evil and there's usually no gray area. people are either portrayed as pure good or pure evil. antagonists are usually evil for the sake of being evil and nothing more.
i applaud kimetsu no yaiba for breaking some of these tropes and giving me a more interesting story, but it disappoints me to see them succumb to more tired cliches.
~~~
i'll start with what i like about kimetsu no yaiba. and when i say like, i really mean love. because there is a lot to love here.
the thing i loved the most were the antagonists. most of the enemies that tanjiro defeats gets a backstory. you learn a little about who they are and you start to think that these demons aren't so bad. the show makes them seem like they're pure evil and i immediately thought this was going to be like every other shonen where they're evil just to because the story needs it. but i found myself sympathizing with the demons a lot. even though they've lost their humanity, deep down, these demons were once people too who had families, hopes, and dreams. there was one scene in particular where a demon sees tanjiro coming in for the killing blow, and at first, she tries thinking of a way out of it, but eventually decides to let him kill her to free herself of pain and suffering. demons aren't just mindless creatures who serve only to kill, they have feelings too and i can't help but relate to them sometimes. this was such a refreshing aspect to see in a shounen show and i can't commend kimetsu no yaiba enough for it. it reminded me of parasyte, which i absolutely loved.
i also adored kimetsu no yaiba's art. the scenes with tanjiro using his water style swordsmanship are absolutely beautiful. the way the water stands out so much to the rest of the art (i think it's CG?) just makes it pop and really draws your eye. the fidelity of the art differs from scene to scene would normally be jarring and annoying, but kimetsu no yaiba uses that to their advantage. when tanjiro goes in for a killing move and you see a close up of his face and it's more detailed than normal, it really emphasizes this big climax and it makes me so hyped. the other part that REALLY stood out to me was muzan's base thing. this big mansion house thing that looks like it's straight out of an MC escher painting was absolutely beautiful. that whole sequence was just unbelievable and i couldn't get enough of it. if i were to really nitpick on this show though, the parts where the characters are CG instead of hand-drawn(?) are a bit jarring. it's something i could spot instantly, but it's not something to knock down kimetsu no yaiba for. they use it wisely, only using it in ""boring"" scenes when the characters are just walking, so it didn't really bother me much.
one thing i found myself doing a lot was getting HYPED. this show knew how to get me to pop off. that first scene with zenitsu was crazy and i had to rewatch that a couple times. or that one scene when tanjiro mixes in his father's fire-breathing technique was POGGERS. this isn't really something i can describe in words well, but if a show can make me that excited, it's really worth mentioning.

now let me talk about what i dislike about kimetsu no yaiba. and when i say dislike, i really mean hate. because the things i dislike about this show really irks me.
firstly, kimetsu no yaiba can't seem to follow it's own rules. or at the very least, kimetsu no yaiba is constanly amending previously established rules like a little kid who changes the rules of a game they made up while they're playing it. in the first episode, giyu, an EXPERIENCED demon slayer, tells tanjiro that his sister, nezuko, had ""her wounds exposed to demon blood [so] she turned into a demon"" (i quote this because that's what he says). so it's implied that you become a demon when exposed to any demon's blood. and it's coming from a reputable source too. but later it's revealed that only muzan, the original demon, can turn people into demons, so i guess giyu was too ambiguous OR the writer just changes the rules on us :thinking:. and even later we learn that tamayo (the demon doctor) was able to turn yushiro into a demon?? the show just can't decide how people become demons and it's pretty frustrating to follow. we're also told that a demon can only die by having their head chopped off by a special sword or by sunlight. but shinobu the butterfly girl also kills them with poison. so i guess they can die to that too?? while not explicitly stated, it's heavily implied that when a demon dies, everything connected to them disappears. for instance, the drum that the drum demon lost (and is being used by a child) disappears when killed by tanjiro. but the mom in the demon spider family's spiders don't disappear when she's killed and they actively effected the fight against the spider dad. and the spider brother's venom doesn't stop, nor do his spider abominations. why don't they??
other than changing it's own rules, kimetsu no yaiba seems to just forget things too. the show also establishes that a demon slayer's sword changes color depending on who's wielding it and that tanjiro's black sword is extremely rare to see. but when all those other low-level demon slayers are on the spider mountain, they all have black swords. it's like kimetsu no yaiba just forgot that swords are supposed to have different colors, so they just made them black by default. and the butterfly lady very clearly had a black sword too, so it's not as rare as it's made out to seem. tanjiro also gets a fox mask from his master urokodaki that has a protection spell on it, but it just straight up disappears at some point, never to be seen again. rewatching episode 5, we see the mask at the very beginning where the demon in final selection says he can tell that tanjiro is urokodaki's student because of the mask. and LITERALLY IN THE NEXT SCENE it disappears from tanjiro's head and never comes back. it also didn't protect him against shit. 
also, kimetsu no yaiba's characters just don't use common sense sometimes. like the mother in the demon spider family's ability is to use webs from her spiders to control people like a marionette. but wouldn't it be WAY more effective to just use those threads to kill people instead of having to take control of someone's body and slash other people? for the majority of those low-level demon slayers, she could've just snapped their necks (which is something she's able to do). and even for those clever enough to figure out what her ability is, you don't need the whole body to attack, you just need the sword. so just control the swords, not the bodies, there's no point to controlling the bodies. or when the pillars are deciding what to do with tanjiro and nezuko, urokodaki sends a letter to the master telling him that nezuko's harmless. but he REALLY should've at least mentioned that he put a spell on her so that she won't hurt them. that might've helped convincing them. i feel like there are a few more instances of this, but i can't really think of more.
kimetsu no yaiba also follows a strict shounen formula. they present the big bad guy, but in order to get to him, you gotta face these 12 other big bad guys first. it's not that big a deal, but it irked me a little to see this trope which i've seen over and over again. don't give me such a structured plot, give me something that feels more organic. it also has very clear ""power up"" sequences where tanjiro goes out and trains for a while and then now he's stronger. it feels kind of cheap when you just throw in a montage of him training and then declare him a lot stronger.
and the most annoying of them all, kimetsu no yaiba frequently uses flash backs and plot conveniences. ""i'm under water. what am i going to do now? the enemy has the advantage! oh wait. i know this one move that's super powerful under water. i totally forgot about that."" or ""i've been injured this whole time, but haven't mentioned it once in the past three episodes so i'm only going to reveal this now during a flashback because the plot calls for a tougher fight"" or ""this guy's totally beating me. how am i going to be able to beat him?!? oh wait. i remembered my training in a flashback that has nothing to do with the fight so i guess i'm going to be able to beat him now"" or ""i need to beat this spider guy and save my sister, but i'm super fatigued. let me just have a flashback of my father who has never shown up in the show before this and reveal that he had a breathing technique that let him ignore fatigue and even though i didn't learn it myself, this flashback is enough to matrix-style teach me how"" which is followed by ""i once saw my dad do this weird fire dance that was never once mentioned before this episode and even though i never learned it, i somehow know how to combine that with my water style swordsmanship to make a fire blade"". this all feels extremely cheap and annoying. it's like tanjiro only remembers things when the plot wants him to. they don't take the time to set up anything up beforehand. everything is shown to the audience moments before it becomes important.
~~~
i know it sounded like i hated on the show a lot, and that's partly true, but the unique art-style, refreshing view on antagonists, and it's hype moments were enough for me to ignore some the hate. i think without some of those better elements, this show would've been closer to a 6.",8,Rexosorous

                Non spoiler review
The plot is good but the story progression is very slow.The anime is still going on .Not much has happened in the story.
The fights are not flashy.They use only swords with different types of breathing techniques.The mc has not shown any special flashy winnings.He is just a rookie right now,he is not a tough fighter right now.But his hard work and determination will definitely make him one of the toughest slayers eventually.Fights are not very impressive,when mc is going to lose in fights,he is helped by his sister or some other third person.This makes the fights uninteresting sometimes.The fights are a more puzzle
                  type.The demon slayer has to think  of the most probable technique that has the highest chance to slay a demon's head.
This is the only drawback(not very interesting fights.) in this anime .Slow story progression is not a big deal.Otherwise,the plot is very good.There is no character development throughout the series.
Mc is able to see and interact with the two spirits,there was no explanation why he could see them.Mc has strong sense of smell,he can smell demons and predict their location,he has a very strong head,he can smash his head  and win.All this have no explanation .
The beginning of the series felt dull (mc went to different places to slay demons and there was no story progression)until  the new characters showed up,it became fun to watch  the comedy scenes.
The ending was very very interesting.It is a cliff hanger but very satisfying.The best part was to see the main villain and his subordinates.The main villain is very scary.Not much has been revealed about him yet.I am very curious to know everything about him and demons.This is the only point that keeps me hooked to the series",7,NoanimeNolife12

                Story: I gave it a 4. It's a pretty typical shonen anime start up with not much to be interested in as far as lore or world building goes. The main story has some intrigue if you can fall for and care about the protagonist and his family but other than that I didn't really find myself drawn to the main conflicts.
Art: Everyone praises this anime for the flashy and intense art style, which I can appreciate and agree with to a very fine extent. I'll say the fighting scenes really show how shonen can be amazing, and they pull off some interesting shots and
                  choreography. Outside of the fights though, the clunky character outlines and big eyed, bobble head character designs kind of throw me off. Of course, this is subject to opinion, I;ve always preferred cleaner and more crisp art styles like FMA, Naruto, Bleach, etc. compared to those, the  overall art style falls very short imo.
Sound: The intro song was instantly a classic. Can't say I remember much of the other OST though, I'm sure if I went back and intentionally listed I'd finsd some bops, but nothing other than the intro really stood out. The sword clanging is always satisfying
Character: Tanjiro was a very basic try hard mary sue. Did not care about his character or his story very much at all. It was hard for me to relate to him and it seemed like they tried very hard to make him likeable. The other characters seemed very 2 dimensional as well, with Nezuko never speaking and the other characters having shallow motivations. I didn't find myself even having a favorite character to be honest. Zenitsu hair is the worst character design ive ever seen in anime.
Enjoyment: Some of the fights were really entertaining, alot of them felt weirdly paced or went on too long. The parts of the show that were really cool felt very short lived or they didn't feel very impactful to the story itself. I also find it interesting that they put so much artistic focus into the sword abilities only to have them be visual effects only. Considering the art carries most of the cool moments in this show, it felt very lackluster.
Overall: I appreciate everything this anime tries to bring to the table but I feel like it just falls short, especially in comparison to both 2000's big 3 as well as upcoming new gen (MHA, Black Clover). They try to make the world seem dangerous but none of the mc's face true danger it seems like. They try to make a very liekable protag but they just ob=ver do it with the tragic story and the sympathetic warrior. I dropped it twoards the end because I just lost interest. Seeing shots of the movie just confirmed that this anime is the equivalent of an inudstry plant, with not much to offer outside of fllashy overhyped fight scenes to rope in casuals and make a quick buck",6,gekkeikan

                The frustrations and subsequent complaints I have for this show are too specific to describe without incurring into lots of spoilers, so I'll settle for the next best thing, which is a simple overview of the major pros and cons:
Kimetsu no Yaiba's strengths lie in the quality of its fight scenes, which feature dazzling explosions of colors and sound and some clever uses of CG. For a few dramatic seconds, it creates an amazing experience for viewers, and you can forget your surroundings and focus exclusively on the complicated magical swordsmanship happening onscreen. There are also a few moments of calm introspection that help us
                  gain a better understanding of some characters and their motivations, which I wholeheartedly appreciate.
However! Those positive moments often feel like small pockets of quality content sprinkled amidst problematic elements. The faults of the show mostly come from questionable humor choices, character interactions and plot contrivances, being a real turn off for me. Much of the social conflict in the story is fueled by miscommunication and/or random onset selective muteness in characters, creating artificial strife only to be hand-waved in the next episode. For all of the joy I experienced with the battles, my appreciation for the show soured due to all the bizarre ""conversations"" in which the quirks of the speakers overrode common sense and reason for the sake of padding the runtime. Since you eventually learn that most of those conflicts will amount to nothing, it's that much harder to feel emotionally invested.
Thus, it gets a 7/10. It's closer to an 8 than a 6, but it's a 7. I recommend it to friends just because some of the fights are really THAT good, but, personally, now that I'm re-watching the first season in preparation for the movie, the beautiful animations that had me wide-eyed and enraptured aren't managing to wash away the sour taste I get in my mouth from the dialogue and from some of character interactions.",7,Johnny_Louis

                The Japanese cast were great 
The art was great especially with episode 19 that everyone kept raving about on social media!
The characters were great although Zenitzu was such an annoying p*rick at times but at least he was the only one who wasn't likeable.
However I just felt the anime couldve done better with just 50 episodes than 26 episodes because I felt in the last episode that it was way too rushed to complete the story on a positive note. All we got was a cliffhanger even though we are getting a sequel movie. Still, it just made me disappointed that they didn't keep giving
                  Demon Slayer more episodes and yes I know there's a manga for me to check out I get that but just my personal opinion...
Anyways regardless of my complaint there, I really enjoyed watching this shounen anime and highly recommend people to give this anime a bingewatch!",8,Curiouswanderer

                       Demon Slayer is one of the best anime of 2019. While it shines in areas like art design, sound design and fight scenes, it lacks in important areas like plot and storytelling ( especially the way it unravels) and character development. Characters are bland, the training scenes are repetitive, and the ""train till you die"" cliche is just too much after some time, happening twice in only 26 episodes. 
      Considering the fact that the anime only has 26 episodes, it's off to a good start, and things can change for the better
                  in terms of storytelling, but the fact that even at this fast pace characters don't show any meaningful development might be a problem that will persist in the future.",8,DaniB810

                I'm not going to be delving too deeply into story here, simply because I don't like to comment overly on those aspects when we haven't really seen a complete story. We'll leave that a few years. For now, I just want to talk about how this season of television comes together, and it's... a little more mixed than I was expecting, given how much praise the show's gotten since it came out.
On the positive notes, the animation from ufotable is pretty exceptional. I did take some time to settle with it; ufotable have always had a fairly consistent art style, at least with the shows
                  I've seen, so seeing something quite drastically different did catch me out a little. But, that isn't actually a flaw in the animation, and for the most part it was exactly the quality I expect from ufotable, especially in the fight scenes. There's a scene in episode 19 that is probably one of the coolest looking bits of animation I've seen this year. I also love Tanjiro as a protagonist; he's optimistic, and kind, and empathetic, and just a great window to look into the world through, and his relationship with Nezuko is a fantastic emotional grounding for the series as a whole. And there's a lot in the supporting cast to like too; a fantastic big bad in Kibutsuji, the fascinating concept of Tamayo and Yushiro, and one of my favourite shounen anime mentors in Urokodaki being particular standouts.
However, the supporting cast is where things also start to get a bit shaky. I hate basically every scene where I'm forced to put up with Zenitsu, who I find incredibly grating and who I really, really hope starts to get over his 'scared of everything' schtick, because it actively damaged my enjoyment of the show. Inosuke was also similarly grating for his first few episodes, although his character did manage to settle a bit and became at least tolerable. I also felt the pacing was quite odd? The show moves very fast in the first half, then slows down significantly in the second half, which made the whole thing feel a little oddly paced, and dragged a lot at times. The last arc is a particularly good example of this; it did in five episodes what really need three at the most.
Overall, this show definitely didn't blow me away in the way its critical reception suggested, and there were significant portions I really struggled to click with. But, nonetheless, I had a good time with the show, and at least found myself invested enough to come back for the movie and future seasons. Not the best shounen ever (in comparing to the other breakout shounen in the last couple of years, I much prefered Jujutsu Kaisen), but a lot of fun, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.",7,AdamIsTalking

Disclaimer: Review written after watching episode 16
Honestly I believe that Demon Slayer is significantly overrated, don't get me wrong, he art is outstanding, but is still bested by shows such as Violet Evergarden or Your Name. The story is repetitive and predictable and fights can be long and dull. The show isn't a bad anime at all, it is just not great and in my opinion and it doesn't live up to its hype at all. Overall the show is underwhelming and I would highly recommended anyone to not watch it while there are many other great shows you could be watching.
Instead of watching
                  this I would recommended watching something like Attack On Titan, The Promised Neverland or even Black Clover.",7,Tavisto

                I, a new anime fan decided to follow the hype train of demon slayer. I was disappointed. The story and characters are the most boring thing. They are just tired cliches without a shadow of depth. The characters have the same amount of depth and personality of three basic words. The only thing which saves this anime is the production. Studio Ufotable is cracked, meaning the art and compositing are absolutely incredible. If this was an average anime adaptation, Demon slayer would not even be known. Also, the coloring looks like edo Japanese art which supports the theme. However, there are so many plot holes
                  and dumb decisions the mangaka made. For instance, why can't people use multiple breathing styles? Also, when characters die, I don't feel sad. They didn't feel like real people, just a personality type.",5,CommunistCowGod

                I haven't read the manga so it could get better, but as of right now this seems like a pretty run of the mill shounen boosted by good art and a very well executed anime adaptation. The character design is distinct and memorable, and the overall visual aesthetic is pleasing. Pretty much everything about the show is great except the story and characters, which can be dissapointingly cliche. I love ~quirky~ characters as much as the next guy, but without a concrete straight-man Tanjiro, Zenitsu, and Inosuke are all just funny men gone wild (this also applys to the big 9 swordsmen/swordswomen who's rank name
                  thing I forget rn). I get that this is a fantasy show but without any semi realistic characters I start to lose my suspension of disbelief. Still worth watching tho",7,WorthlessCar

                Oh. My. God.
This anime is painful. 
Not in the good way, of course, or I'll never write this review. The writing is so mediocre, it's frustrating. Why I can finish this anime is a miracle on itself.
I swear to myself, if I get notification from any Youtuber that I subscribed about covering Gurenge once more or making something related to Kimetsu no Yaiba, I'll try watch it. Even if the premise uninteresting as hell. It smells like another shounen anime genre that get overhyped.
And my fears are confirmed. It just another shounen genre anime that get too much attention.
Because of ufotable, of course. Duh.
And Lisa (but she's surprisingly mediocre in 'Gurenge' and bad in 'from the edge'. Lisa just cannot carry FictionJunction's haunting music. Her voice just cannot blend into the song, it is so jarring to listen them).
I just can't blame anyone who want to watch this anime because of ufotable. The action sequence is just breathtaking. I always waiting the moment Tanjirou using his Water Breathing Technique. There's no awkward or horribly animated scene if you paused it at anytime. Everything is just so crisp and beautiful, I really enjoy the animation aspect of this anime. I can write an essay, simping over ufotable animation. While it is amazing, there's a bit that disturb me. More on that later. 
We also can't forget the sound effect aspect of this anime. It just so beautifully done, it's one of my favorite now. They really carry the atmospheric nuance in this anime. Eerie, haunting, beautiful. Yuki Kajiura and Go Shiina really did a very amazing job.
Together with the sound effect and music, this anime is a feast for ears and eyes. 
But, that's it.
There's nothing more than beautiful-looking anime with amazing sound effect. Even the OP and ED is mediocre at best.
The writing is mediocre. I imagine that ufotable hire the most talented animator, but had to hiring the most subpar scriptwriter to manage the budget. There's nothing about the character that drawn me in, that can sympathize with them.
I really don't ask this anime to be as complex as Shingeki no Kyojin or as nihilist as Tokyo Ghoul (for this is a simple shounen anime), but there's no realness in it. I thought there will be more moral dilemma or moral conflict that the anime can highlight with character like Nezuko. A character that turned into a demon unwillingly. Like Kaneki. But every arc just super smooth. For a creature that have to sustain themselves with human flesh, Nezuko showed little to no interest in human as food. While other demon -other than Tamayo- written as mindless beast that cannot help but gorge themselves with human flesh. There's no dilemma in Tanjirou that someday maybe he really have to kill Nezuko. I don't read the manga, so I don't know if it as flippant with this theme or not. It really doesn't help that there's little to no Nezuko's POV in the entire 26 episode. I just cannot connect with her. And her little conflict with Hashira just cannot make up the entire season with the lack of her characterization.
Another issue with Nezuko, she shown to be quite tough, resilient character as the eldest daughter in the flashback, but the moment she became demon, she almost like become infant-like. Like there's no agency to her character. She just became another damsel in distress -one with demonic strength. Like the agency and resilience she had when she was human, vanish them moment she become a demon. 
Tanjirou is no better. For a 26 episode, he does not have any character development. I get it that he's resilient, kind, and everything. But there's no moment where his resolution came in question. And for a character that have tragic background, the fact there's little remorse and despair and sadness that shown in the anime, makes me feels disconnected to him. I found myself questioning his bond with his family with this lack of emotional depth on his part. I just cannot believe his kindness more than any other people. It just all tell, no show. The fact he's slaying all the 'bad' demon easily while not questioning the humanity Nezuko had is really hypocrite, not kindness. As a brother that has a demon sister, why he's not questioning more about the order from organization?
Let's talk about Kamado Family. For anime that using family as their central theme, surprisingly, there's little to no presence of Kamado family in it. I know their name, but that's it. There's no nostalgia or discussion about them between Nezuko and Tanjirou. And the family only got shown in the most convenient time, like when Nezuko or Tanjirou seriously got hurt and almost die, or when Tanjirou unlocking Hinokami Kagura. But other than that, nope. The lack of presence of Kamado family in it makes the dynamic between Nezuko and Tanjirou sometimes a bit weird. 
Other character are no better. They're there for the sake of story. For Tanjirou's convenience. 
Now, let's talk about the demon and the 'magic system'.
This anime has the weakest, most pathetic attempt of humanizing a demon, a villain. There's no demon that I can sympathize. And it's such a wasted opportunity. Especially, Rui. His story and situation can be a perfect way to juxtapose everything Tanjirou valued. To make a catalyst for his character growth. But noooo, his life is just another flashback. Few flashback before they die doesn't makes them suddenly more human. It just lame. I can't help rolling my eyes a few times.
'Magic system', or in their world, Breathing Technique. There's little to no explanation about it. It's fucking frustrating! While I hate Naruto with it's many filler and many flaws, they have decent explanation about their jutsu. I understand clearly, from the start of the series, how, when, why the jutsu works. But in Kimetsu no Yaiba, there's nothing. Yes, there's explanation about how breathing makes muscle stronger or whatever. But there's no visual or in-depth explanation about it. And we have to suspense our disbelief. Are you kidding me?
It feels half-hearted at best. The lack of explanation about the magic system makes Hashira's appearance became insignificant. How we supposed to believe they're the best, if there's no explanation about how the world works?
Another thing that disturbs me, the stylization choice. 
Between Tanjirou and Giyuu, there's nothing that pointed Giyuu is older than Tanjirou. The round, childish face of almost entire cast makes me go 'urgh!'. The most adult, beautiful face I've seen in the series are Oyakata-sama and Kibutsuji Muzan. Like, why? I get it you want the good guy to look as beautiful as possible. But that shouldn't make it harder to distinguish who's the older one. The scene where Tanjirou and Shinobu talks thrown me off for a few seconds, because Shinobu there looks more like Tanjirou's peer rather than his superior.
This anime is really wasted potential. It just tiring to fill all the gaps the important part are missing.
Hope ufotable change the scriptwriter in season 2. (And please, give us better OP and ED).",2,Myouki_Kuroki

                Wonderful atmosphere enveloped in everything that I wish more anime would offer.
With an anime culture teeming with giant robots, giant humans, and secret ninja spells its nice to have something that requires hard work, patience, and traditional value of personal strength
Demon Slayer is a brilliant example of what hard work and perseverance can accomplish.
It takes main protagonist, Tanjiro, literal years to even come close to being able to achieve his goals.
The art styling, and the depth of character is something truly wonderful.
If you are looking for a fast paced, ""Beat 'em up"" Anime, this isnt it.
This is an anime that will take elements of your favorites and show them in a beautifully rendered lights.
Compassion for the evil, who only became that way as a product of their environment, or necessity. 
Fierce ruthlessness, brought when reason is overlooked and cast aside.
True strength and conviction, to see that you have failed, yet narrowly get another chance to prove yourself.
All of these are aspects of Tanjiro that resonate loudly with the cast and the viewer.

                Overall, I would recommend Demon Slayer Kimetsu no Yaiba to most anime fans!
It is very light on power systems in comparison to other shounen such as Hunter x Hunter or Jujutsu Kaisen – which makes it really easy to understand. There are some details around sword techniques and rankings – but nothing too hard to grasp. The characters are all very visually interesting and have a diverse range of personalities which I think will appeal to a wide audience.
As for the story, it doesn’t linger too long on one arc which helps to keep you engaged, but I do wonder if this might feel rushed?
                  If you typically enjoy shows that are more complex and technical, I think there could be an angle where Demon Slayer might feel simple or cliché due to its use of typical shounen tropes. Then again, I think that made it good for binge-watching – so it really depends on the mood you’re in!
Overall, it was a good watch, had good characters with diverse skills, and had many interesting enemies. I recommend Demon Slayer if you enjoy combat, big effects, and friendship building. It isn’t the best shounen I have seen, but it holds its own with cool visuals and character uniqueness!",8,theanimetourist

                As is always the curse with shounen shows and we would find similar issues within teenage books as well. The story writing and character portrayal are pretty bland and poorly done. 
But that is more the rule for these things rather than a sad inconvenience. 
What Kimetsu no Yaiba makes up for instead is probably the best tv show animation since Violet Evergarden. 
Amazing music score and great combat choreography that has been beautifully incorporated with the art style to make it feel powerful, magical and delicious to observe. 
And a sense of pacing that actually does all this justice while trying to hide what
                  passes for writing quality in these genres. 
I give the show a 6 due to the writing. 
But if you want to go into this leaving the brain outside and just enjoy the visual experience this show is. I would easily place this on a score of 9 pedestal and proudly present it to you.",6,Silvir
38000,"
                Going to try something new and review by explaining the scores I gave.  I tried not to spoil so let's hope so spoils made it in 
Story: 7.  It's the typical something happens to the protagonist and they have to go on a journey and get strong.  It's not new and it's something we've seen before.  However it's still done in a way that's adds its own flair and style so I liked it
Art/Sound: both 9.  The art looked gorgeous, as if out of a comic book.  The colors were gorgeous and it looked so beautiful.  The sound
                  worked as well; it's really fitting and helped tug the heartstrings during the sad moments.  So overall loved both
Character: 3.  This might be a harsh number but I blame Inosuke and Zenitsu.  They had their moments where I liked them, they weren't all bad. . .but then they got annoying and over the top I didn't like.  Inosuke was all fight fight fight to the point where it got aggravating; there's ways to do it that still brings the charm but Inosuke had none of it.  Zenitsu was all fear all crying all the time.  I wish more of those moments where he was asleep and brave would come out.  There's nothing wrong with a character scared of everything but when they're crowning moments are when unconscious that's not good.  However his breathing technique he did in one episode was smart and I did enjoy that side of him.  Nekuzo was good too; mainly a plot device so far but at least once in a while she's utilized.  Also the fact she's a demon who won't attack humans is really a good premise to go anywhere.  Tanjiro was the typical protagonist but he was also good.  His heart I think is a big thing because normally or the thought would be he'd grow dark but no, he remained kind and kept his spirit; good on him
Enjoyment: 6.  I gave this a 6 because it was good.  Some spots were amazing, especially with Tanjiro and Nekuzo, but Zenitsu and Inosuke made me fast forward a bit and one episode (you know the one) made me so. . .not infuriated but made Tanjiro so OP.  I guess that'll be explained in future seasons/movies and even in the manga but they made him that strong and then still need to fight was just. . .unnecessary.  I know the protagonist has to have that OP to be the protagonist but still it gets tiring.
Overall: 6.  I did enjoy it regardless of everythign so I gave it a 6.  It's defintiely good but characters lowered it a bit, it's somethign we've seen before or variations of it and then that episode.  I wanted to give it a 5 but I think the show's fair.  Something I'd watch again after a while but still maybe after another season/movie is out for a while I'd watch it.",6,Bookloner

                In my opinion, this is a shounen show for shounen fans, for young people who enjoy simplistic, over-the-top yet shallow character designs. 
**warning: might contain some spoilers, at least on the first half of the show**
Let's start with the plot: Tanjiro's family is killed by some demons and he becomes a demon hunter. Ok fine. Here's where we will encounter our first example of shallow writing. This family is living in the forest, for who knows how many years. In all this time, there has been no mention of demons apparently, and nobody has thought of warning them about living in the middle of a
                  mountain without any weapons or training to defend themselves. Whatever is in their past, the anime does not care about. They're just there to be killed and give the main character a motivation, a reason to become a demon hunter. Shallow, disposable characters. 
Then, we have the issue of his little demon sister. Somehow, she is the first demon ever that decides that she won't eat humans, because...well, basically because her brother tells her not to. That's all. ""Don't eat people!"" ""Ah okay! Gotcha"". If that's all it took, why didn't anyone do it before? Well, because it doesn't really matter. It's just a way to explain why she doesn't eat people. She was told not to, okay? Just quit asking questions. 
Then, some of the characters are just one-dimensional goofs. The most annoying of them all was Zenitsu, who does nothing other than cry all the time and be absolutely useless. UNTIL HE PASSES OUT AND THEN HIS INNER POWER WAKES UP AND HE CUTS DOWN ALL THIS ENEMIES WITH HIS SWORD. That's literally all he does. It's supposed to be cool that he has this inner power, but at least during the first season of this anime, that was absolutely never developed. I was extremely annoyed every time his character was on screen. 
Another example of ridiculous character design is the scene where Tanjiro meets the Pillars. Supposed to be this group of excellent fighters and powerful do-gooders, their first suggestion is ""Let's kill this guy who is carrying a demon around"". Even the stereotypical monk-like guy with the praying beads (which should be the nicest one of them, you'd think) is like ""yeah, let's kill this dude. No need to ask any further questions."" Then, two scenes later, after they are convinced that Nezuko will not eat people, they go ""oh yeah, I felt tremendous potential in Tanjiro. He will be a great warrior one day"".
THEN WHY THE HECK DID YOU WANT TO KILL HIM SO BADLY WHEN YOU FIRST MET HIM?? Oh yeah, because it is funny that first they want to kill him and then they change their minds. But instead of writing them changing their mind in a more sophisticated way, they  just went ""Nop, first they want to kill him , for no reason, so there's tension and danger, and then we just flip their attitudes because now they are friends with Tanjiro and that's what friends do"". 
In summary: This is not a smart anime. This is a silly anime about swords and vampires. Don't expect much out of it.",4,fagurado

                While I enjoyed this season overall, I was disappointed by it. Episodes 1-10 showed promise for a shounen anime to finally make it to my Greatest of All Time list. The first 3 episodes were incredible with its character and world building. However, the show was severely diluted with the introduction of two characters, Zenitsu and Inosuke.
Zenitsu and Inosuke are given considerable screen time, yet they truly do not add value to the story. In fact, they bring a jarring tonal shift when they are introduced in episode 11 & 12, respectively. By episode 16, I remembered wishing that the show focused on Tanjiro and
                  Nezuko traveling the world, sometimes coming into contact with other demon slayers. I remembered thinking that several impactful moments from episodes 15-17 were diminished by Zenitsu and/or Inosuke’s previous banter.
Note: my character section will be a massive wall of text, so I am moving it to the end of this review.
- Story. Despite having a cliche premise, what made the show stand out to me was its pretty good foreshadowing and emphasis on showing over telling. It actually answered my continuity questions raised at the end of one episode into the next episode on multiple occasions. I thought we were going to get a filler-free and naturally flowing story until Zenitsu and Inosuke show up. Their arcs ultimately went nowhere, so I started feeling a dragged out, Narutoesque fatigue with their appearance.
- Art. I like the anime's stylized lineart better than the manga. The actual art style for its characters looks like a fusion of shounen and shoujo to me. I dig the tumblresque two-toned hair; the different eye shapes, pupils, and iris shapes (Tanjiro’s eyes are also slightly octagonal); and the hypebeast feudal clothing (haven’t seen anything similar to this vibe since Samurai Champloo). Coupled with saturated colors, the show offered many visually striking scenes. I was also a fan of the ukio painting representation of the water technique.
- Animation. They used a combination of 2D and 3D animation techniques, but kept the fluid fight scenes in 2D which was impressive. They also chose to animate small details that seemed special to me. I remember seeing Nezuko's hair moving up and down as she was breathing, even though she was in the shadows and it was not necessary to depict this.
- Music. Great soundtrack/background music.
- Sound design. I almost didn’t give any more points here, but two memorable moments pushed it over the edge for me. First, the Tanjiro meme face was complemented with complete silence. The scene was so effective that I uncontrollably let out a sharp cackle. Second, there was a quick scene in episode 24 where Tanjiro yelled ""Yes"" and his earrings rattled as his head moved. I was impressed by this subtle decision to emphasize his enthusiastic personality.
- Writing. The actual dialogue uttered by characters aren't super cringy for a shounen, although stereotypical at times. Most of the things that Tanjiro says came off as natural. Zenitsu’s constant, yappy, unfunny, minutes-long edited scenes drags this category down. The show demonstrates that it doesn’t have to be outlandish to be funny, and the outlandish moments would be fine if they didn’t hammer home the same shtick over and over again like beating a dead horse. Tanjiro's chibified scenes are tolerable because at least something of value -- an idea, characterization, etc. --  is being transmitted in them. 
- Emotional impact. Full marks when it comes to the better written characters (Tanjiro, Nezuko, Urokodaki, Tamayo, Tomioka, Shinobu, Kanao). Zenitsu and Inosuke, being main characters of this season, miss the mark. By the time they had their character growth episodes, I didn’t really care. Sure I felt bad for them as they were getting beat up, but I was eager for their moment to wrap up.
- Characters. 
1. Tanjiro is best boy. It is very refreshing to see a male protagonist who cries and holds peoples’ hands; i.e. someone who doesn’t have an issue with showing their affection and articulating their emotions. It was also impressive for the series to show him encouraging himself (no one else is around to do it) and figuring things out mid-battle. His mid-battle creativity reminded me of Disney's animated Mulan. Being a gentle person isn’t his only defining trait. The show builds up his disposition as a natural leader that people want to cooperate with. In addition to being energetic and positive,Tanjiro has moments of self doubt, mostly during battles. He simply can't afford to die though. He recognizes that it isn't working, gets creative, or hangs on long enough to come up with an adaptive strategy. This is how you write characters who overcome ""fight or die"" situations. He rarely pulls new tricks out of thin air. Of the few times he does, I felt that there was sufficient foreshadowing to justify it. 
2. Individual  demon backstories were a nice touch, although I didn't think every single defeated demon needed one. Some of them actually gave me depressing Mushishi/Natsume Yuujinchou vibes with how distinctly human their vignettes felt.
3. Nezuko’s post-demon characterization is pretty good for a character that never talks. We only get glimpses of her human personality through Tanjiro’s rose colored memories, but she is so precious. Her post-demon personality is mostly demonstrated through silent scuttling and grunts. One of my favorite scenes shows her view of Tanjiro putting on his uniform through her eyes; her blanket frames the top of the screen. Since she can’t talk, I was okay with the sparing use of side characters' exposition explaining Nezuko's growth. 
4. Zenitsu's scenes are so bad, and I'll tell you why. After realizing his useless chibi monologues will be a recurring act starting episode 11, I began fast forwarding all of his scenes, only stopping to absorb actual character development. When did I stop having to do this? Never. It continued through episode 26. For me to be forced to click through all his scenes for 15 episodes is unforgivable. There are better ways to develop a timid and shy person who’s been betrayed in the past, wallows in self-pity, and comes to realize their inner strength. Which, by the way, was told and not shown - it was briefly mentioned in his thoughts. His character can be reduced down to 2 or 3 distinct quirks, which I won't spoil here.
Zenitsu is not unlikeable because he’s unrelatable; he’s unlikeable because he’s written poorly. Stop having him shout and cry at the top of his lungs every scene, because that’s not how mentally stable people generally talk. It’s as bad as Asta from Black Clover. It’s unnecessary filler designed to stretch out the TV program to meet the length quota. Removing a majority of these over-the-top scenes does not change the story at all. You know how I know that? Because I discussed this with a friend in real life, and they quizzed me on Zenitsu's character development to see if I really understood it. I passed.
It would have been okay for Zenitsu to lack depth if his screen time was spent developing his friendship with Tanjiro. By the end of the season, I didn’t think their bond was strong enough to explain their bromance outside of Tanjiro’s caring nature and the fact that they happened to survive life-threatening situations together. There was also a missed opportunity to explore depression or anxiety with Zenitsu's character. Some of his normally voiced lines may indicate mild depression.
To make matters worse, Zenitsu is the thick headed skirt chaser. Him physically chasing a visibly distressed Nezuko for over 5 minutes wasn’t funny; it was gross. Fast forward to episode 24, and he is still yelling and screaming the same tired joke about pretty girls.
5. Inosuke also has as much dimension as a piece of A4 paper. When he was first introduced, I thought he was going to be an intriguing antagonist who could challenge Tanjiro physically and mentally. I was interested in seeing how the show would turn an unlikeable character into a likeable one, or at least one I can understand even if I don’t agree with them. This moment never comes.
Inosuke's looks are a source of irony, as is his actual character. For someone who grew up in dog-eat-dog world circumstances, his actions are extremely unconvincing. He lacks any powers of observation and fights so destructively that he doesn't care about taking damage on his body. Lacking social skills and learning teamwork with Tanjiro is a more believable character arc. But he actually doesn’t learn. He basically says “screw it I’m doing it my way” and almost gets himself killed. And then still doesn’t learn anything after that!
Something happens to him that would later be an opportunity for overcoming self doubt and depression. His later actions negated the whole “self-identifying areas for improvement and learning to do things differently in order to grow” thing. Instead of trying to be motivated intrinsically, his motivation for improvement was merely to avoid being outshined by Tanjiro. 
6. The Hashira cast look and act like JoJo Bizarre Adventure characters. Their introduction was plagued with caricature tropes, annoying personalities, and generally irrational behavior.",7,pickyviewer

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is ultimate color by number shounen. There are no surprises, no twists, and nothing that breaks from the typical ""kid fights demons"" formula. The show is pretty, and is some of the best animation you can find. The animation makes the fights very enjoyable to look at. However, this is the series' one and only strength. 
The story is utterly generic. Big bad kills hero's family. Hero wants revenge. That's the long and short of it. Apart from 1 demon late in the series, the villains are very shallow. One demon had a backstory that was supposed to be ""tragic"" but it
                  was so shoddily written it ended up being half hilarious, half nonsensical, both with the worst implications. 
The heroes are equally bland. The protagonist is your typical spirited young boy with a heart of gold who is morally superior to everyone and everything. The supporting cast are more caricatures than characters. You've got crazy beast man, wacky womanizer, emotionless mentor, etc. Each one is just a different flavor of one-dimensional. 
The worldbuilding is piss-poor. There is so much wasted potential in the Demon-Hunter organization. Their tactics and operational procedures are profoundly stupid, and it's a wonder that it carries on as an organization at all. And, rather than introducing the protagonist to the machinations of this organization and the people who allow it to function, they rattle off a bunch of meaningless ranks. 
I could go on more, but suffice to say, this is a show meant to be watched for the pretty colors, but not to really be paid attention to.",7,RuroniHS

                When you watch this show, you can tell that it has great and I mean GREAT potential but the story line is pretty rushed which is why I think so many people hate on it. I enjoyed the show because its entertaining and captivating but I disliked the show because of its pacing, for example, why do we already know BEFORE the end of the season what the main villain looks like, I personally thought that if Tanjiro was led to believe otherwise, then at the last minute found out who Muzan actually was would make a lot of watchers anticipate the next season, but

                Demon Slayer is a stunningly beautiful anime with all the facets of a nice, highly enjoyable Isekai- though I believe it follows the formula therein rather closely. Beginning with the story, it has everything you need for a good old Hero's Journey; You have an idealistic and honorable protagonist, tragedy that begins an adventure, a period of intense and frustrating training with a mysterious old master culminating in an almost impossible test, and even some friends who join the hero, learn from him, and end up having their own parallel journeys through him. Ufotable plays with this formula very little, making sure that the protagonist,
                  his friends, his enemies, and even his motivations are just unique enough without breaking any molds. As a result they have a tried and true method of storytelling that is refined through the work of centuries, and is guaranteed to serve as a good vessel for their tale. However, while it is very firmly good, the fact that it is almost filling in an outline prevents it from being truly great, hence my rating. Where it truly shines, however, is in the visual department. This anime is  one of the top three I have ever seen in terms of just how damn pretty it is. Watching it on a nice TV or high-end monitor is an awe-inspiring experience. The outfits of the human characters are compelling down to the very minutia and the concepts and designs of the various demons are simply inspired. The fighting styles and their resultant aesthetics are vibrant in their color and painstaking in their detail. The art of this anime is electric and crackling with energy when it wants to be, funny when it pleases, and stoically contemplative without missing a beat. Hell, even the 3D looks good! In short, I cannot express enough just how good this anime looks. Moving on, the Sound design is very good, with the music providing motifs at the right moments and the ambient sounds lending the world a sense of realism and believability. The characters are a wonderful cast of hero's journey essentials, and I believe they really hit the mark in crafting the perfect set of characters to fulfill their roles in this respect. Overall, a very enjoyable anime that goes from good to great when you factor in the art direction. Do recommend.",8,SgtSalamander

                Demon Slayer or Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of the animes i was the most hyped to watch and also got recommended the most by my friends, i got to episode 7 and decided to drop it because of the horrible and lazy writting. I hate Demon Slayer, don't get me wrong, the art even though I don't like it, is really good, the animation is fantastic and the sound effects and music are good, but that doesn't make it good overall. The story is extremely basic and boring, it sometimes relies on pure shock factor, the characters are horribly written, Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Inozuke
                  are all annoying stereotypes and the few female characters are all really bad, they have no depth whatsoever and aren't shown as equals to the male ones, I know the show is set in the 1920's but goddamn you don't need to be sexist just because of the time period, its a fictional story, THE AUTHOR ISN'T A MAN THEY SHOULD UNDERSTAND THIS. Oh and the representation of color in the anime is non existent, everyone is either extremely white or a bit less white but still white. I know i've only seen 7 episodes of the series but i have done my research, i have read, i have seen other episodes but i dont know which ones and honestly they all were as boring and horribly written as the other ones, I even watched the fight with Gyutaro and I hated how badly their sister is written like dude she is a demon too you know?

                Just to get done with the obvious part: the art-style fits the show amazingly and I've yet to see an action scene in anime with such a good styling and soundtrack as the one which happens in the latter half of this.
The story isn't anything special, it's a recipe as old as story telling. Underdog gets beaten down, endures because he has to protect someone special, gets power-up and wins. I feel this will become more problematic on latter seasons/movies, but for now it worked since the show was mostly sustained on the great production and only needed the plot not to fuck up too

Story was basically like every other shonen. Something bad happens to the MC and he wants revenge and to help his family and friends.
There was no character development but the characters were still cool and funny.
Humor was cute and it wasn't just fan service like ""haha boobs so funny"" (like in most animes).
Most enemies had different powers but the mc was like ""water sword attack goes brrr"".

                Ufotable have done a brilliant job adapting Demon Slayer into an anime. It is one of the most gorgeous anime that I've seen. The elemental attacks that we see are supposed to be a visual representation of what is actualy happening and the show made it like a work of art. 
This show has also handled CGI amazingly and there are so many scenes where the show uses it to make the scenes something that would never be possible in manga form. You will watch these scenes and afterwards, if you go look at them in the manga, you will say ""wow, this manga really
                  doesn't do the anime justice"".
The characters are also pretty interesting and the main cast is great and they compliment eachother really well.
I would say that I didn't really start enjoying the show until halfway when Inosuke gets introduced and the main gang is completed. There are so many great interractions and banter between eachother and you can tell these are really friends.

Blade of Demon Destruction is an anime I randomly came upon whilst browsing for new anime, and, frankly, it has been very enjoyable so far. This review may contain some spoilers, so be warned!
Story: 7
The story itself is somewhat haphazard towards the beginning and attempts to go for a 'shock' approach in order to entice new viewers. This is because of the utter massacre of our MC's (Tanjiro) family at the start of episode 1, which was honestly quite boring and empty aside from the well-executed gory artwork. I suppose this was done to give Tanjiro an excuse to swear vengeance upon demons and begin
                  hunting them down. To my surprise, our MC's sister Nezuko survives the demon attack and becomes a demon herself, which is a mildly interesting plot twist that adds a new female protagonist to the show. Her rescue was quite dramatic, but it allows for us to be empathetic with our MC. Thus begins our protagonist's journey. His journey is full of hardships and follows the standard 'shounen' storyline that we have all seen before. Because of this, the story itself receives an average score so far.
Artwork: 7
The artwork is just above average. I had just stumbled upon this anime after finishing Mushishi (which has stunning artwork), and the difference in art styles was quite astounding given that they are over 10 years apart. That said, the art is acceptable with a decent colour palette and engaging animation typical of shounen anime. It can easily be improved by adding subtle ambient animation e.g. blowing trees and grass etc. 
Personally, I hate that stupid black/green coat Tanjiro wears but it's not really important so...
Sound: 8
Proper soundtrack, nothing overly special. Op 1 by LiSA is a tad cliché, but sounds great so I can tell why people like it. The combat soundtrack especially is very good at setting the action scenes.
Character: 7
As mentioned before, character development is initially slow and feels empty and forced. Over time, we see that Tanjiro actually cares about his sister and wishes to avenge his family- but this is nothing too sensational. On a side note, I think it is very interesting that he forgives demons and sympathises with their struggles in life. However, character development is slightly dodgy, especially with the old man who trains our MC. He isn't too relevant to the story, but it is easy to tell that the studio cut some corners during Tanjiro's training period when he was around. This ended up causing some awkwardness when the anime tried to make us feel sorry for the old man once we discover his previous students died to the ogre demon. Overall, characters are decent and portray believable emotions and can sometimes be a little funny when comedy is attempted. Once again, nothing incredibly praiseworthy.
Enjoyment: 10
Wow. The only true reason I enjoy this anime is the strangely exciting fight scenes and strength progression of our MC. I personally love anime with OP MCs who can overcome anything if they really try. So far, I think Tanjiro is very good at overcoming situations and becoming more potent. I really want to see his Demon Hunter rank rise and for him to become famous. I've waited a long time for this ever since anime like One Outs, Mob Psycho and Hunter x Hunter (incidentally, all published by Studio Madhouse).
Overall: 8
Despite loving the story, the other aspects of the anime fall a little short and stop me from giving a 9 or 10. I hope to see this anime do well

                The most hyped Anime at the moment. KnY is called a Masterpiece and best Anime of the Year, but is this Anime really that good? But at first I want to say this review is just my opinion.
Story, the Story is very interresting, a world full of demons who kill people to eat them and a group of people who kill this demons. It's nothing really special but quite interresting. But there is a little problem for me. The first season has imo too less impact. The main anthargonist got just few minutes screentime and some episodes feels aometimes like they got streched. But overall
                  its a very good story and I personally hope that this story will getting more deepness and complexity.
Character, Tanjiro is one of the best Shounen protagnists I have ever seen, but overall the Characters in KnY are the biggest weakness of this Anime. Shinobu is pretty interesting and Nezuko is cute and thats okay, but especially Zenitsu and Inoske are just there to be funny. Zenitsu cry the hole time and inoske scream the hole time and I ask me who find this funny and is older than 12? Sorry but imo Zenitsu and Inoske are just annoying and useless at the moment and I hope they will getting more serious in the movie or in the next season. Overall the Characters are okay but nothing more. There are some very good and some very bad characters.
Art, the Art is beautiful, but I must actually say Episode 19 wasn't that good, it was great but imo there are many much better fights out there. My problem with this Animation is, that so many people think the Animation is making a Masterpiece and that's totally wrong imo. The Animations are Important for the feeling and the enjoyment but if the story are boring or else the animation can't fix that. Overall the Animation are great, but guys, pls calm down, this isn't the first Anime with great Animations.
Sound, the Soundtrack of this Anime has some nice tracks but overall just one theme stuck in my head. The OST fits good in this Anime but it's nothing really special
Enjoyment, this anime was really fun and i enjoyed it really, but especially the last 3-4 episodes feels like filler episodes and episode 19 wasn't the best episode imo.
Overall, KnY is a very good Shounen Anime with great Animation, very good story and with much fun, but this Anime isn't nearly that good like some people want to see it. It is worth a recommandation who ever want to see a nice shounen Anime but this Anime isn't more than a Shounen, but I will wait for other seasons and we will see :D",8,_weyhxx

                As one of those animes which many people took a liking to from the beginning which shocked its fanbase and gave Tanjiro new purpose it really outdid itself with very well done character development which lead to connecting with the characters even deeper, it also has decent pace to it for 26 episodes and great art to go with great sword fighting in it. The amount of detail the world has including demons and demon slayers is very good. 
This is classed as a mainline anime so if you haven't watched it then it's definitely one to watch if you like action mixed with comedy.

                A lot of people say that ""Kimetsu no Yaiba"" is overrated, but tbh, I think its about right. I hear a lot of things like, ""its so popular only because of the art and the graphics"", but c'mon, isn't one of the most important things in an anime, the art? The story in general depends on the watcher because its the type of story that some people like but I don't think its so bad to the point that it needs to be rated a 4. Plus, the music matches the fights, scene's, and the story in general (op, endings, theme's). Haha I don't really
                  think that a lot of people will agree to me but I think that ""best anime of 2019"" was well deserved.

                I know what you're thinking. I honestly do.
 it's either:
""It's just going through a stage of popularity, it'll die eventually.""  
or:
""Dude y'all this is going to be the next MASTERPIECE. ""
I half-heartedly agree with that statement. I admit at this point in time, I do agree on that factor a lot. Maybe some people are being exposed to UFOTABLE's animation potential for the first time. But have you ever seen this popularity? It's totally on another level. Why though?
I do not think it's going to be the next ""masterpiece."" For starters, we're only at season 1. We have no idea what's going to go
                  down in the next seasons. It might totally go downhill from here. I do see the potential, but at this point in time, I strongly believe that we should sit out this masterpiece talk. 
*THE FOLLOWING DOES INCLUDE SPOILERS FOR THE ANIME*
Let's start with the plot. The plot is pretty basic, it's been done a lot in other anime. So what makes it unique? There's a lot of key points in it that make the plot work. First of all, I think we should recognize that despite having Tanjiro's entire family murdered, he wasn't fighting demons for revenge. I think that's a point that we forget a lot, and we should pay attention to it. Tanjiro hasn't moved on from his family's death, but he doesn't show demons' hatred for it either. When he slays demons, he feels sympathy for them. He shows respect, whether it's because Nezuko is also a demon, or whether it's that he knew they were also human before and suffered. I also think something that made KNY special was the power structure. Everything revolves around your breathing technique, and I think that's also a key concept that makes KNY distinct. But be honest here, after finishing KNY breathing was a meme. 
Now moving on to the art. If we all can agree on something, KNY's animation was, put in words, spectacular. Take any scene. ANY. If we took the scenes from the later episodes when the squad went to the attack spider family, UFOTABLE really stepped it up there. The mother spider decapitation was breathtaking. The smooth sword cut with the beautiful lighting. Tanjiro VS. Rui, there was so much building up to the moment you probably cried. The smooth transition between the water blue color to the orange fire color was SMOOTH. It is PLEASING. to the EYES. Straight up some free eye candy. More regarding the color schemes, take the Hashira character designs for example. They are COLORFUL. It looks. NICE. Words do not describe it your EYES tell you you like it. The camera shots were also something distinctive. The camera moves around following the character, which isn't something you see often due to the difficulty of animating that. The animators used CG, which is harshly judged due to misuse. Ufotable used the CG in such a way I didn't even know was possible. 
The sound. The word itself doesn't sound exciting. But it's pretty important. We have our generic footsteps and tree shuffling, and then we also have incredible water flow movement sounds. More on the sound, the OST track Kamado Tanjiro no Uta was put in perfectly. It hyped the scene up way more than if you put just a sword slash effect. 
Every character was likable in some sense. You liked Zenitsu because of his comedic personality, you liked Inouske because he was loud, or you like Nezuko because you're a normal person. If you did not like Nezuko then the human race does not accept you anymore and you are now classified as a 0 IQ potato. The side characters were especially special, so they really stole the attention of the main character. And we all can agree that the adorable faces they made were the cure for cancer. So the characters were not incredibly special, but they also were not sakura rated trash. 
Watching the show, I was really hesitant and judgy. Everyone was saying this was a masterpiece show, so I should really pay attention to everything to see if it really is that good. I did end up enjoying the show, and it got really hype at points. So I did enjoy the watching process. However, what really ruined the show for me was the constant fandom pestering about its amazingness. 
In summary, I probably would not have written a review if not for the overwhelming popularity. I understand it is a good show with quality points, but so do a lot of other shows. I do think this level of popularity is somewhat unnecessary and unreasonable.",8,yubread

                Story progression is rather slow for 26 episodes. I noticed this from the first 5 episodes, like two episodes can be compressed to one which makes this first season possible to be packed in 13 episodes. Art and videography is outstanding, that's for you from the same studio who made the Fate series, the characters have beautiful designs and style and the actions, superb. Voice acting and actual portrayal of characters is realistic, this is what bought me to watching this (and also LiSA as the singer of the OST hehe) I would love to see the 2nd season but heck, give each episode justice,

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is a fantasy/dark fantasy anime set in the late Edo period in Japan. In this review I will be going somewhat into spoiler territory.
Story & Characters: The story is a typical shounen-anime story, dressed up in darker more edgy clothes, spottet with some bright spots of ""fun"". It follows Tanjirou Kamada on his journey to find a cure for his sister Nezuko, who was turned demon by the original demon, which slaughtered their family while Tanjirou was away. He trains and becomes a demon slayer in order to try and force the demons into telling him how to make Nezuko human again.
                  On his journey Tanjirou meet a lot of unique characters (maybe a it too many). One thing that bugged me about the show was how EVERY character has to have some tragic and sad backstory to ""explain"" their actions, no matter how evil they get. Another thing is something that can be attributed to many shounen anime, the inconsistency when it comes to the characters ""power level"", which changes back and forth on the fly.
Art & Sound: The art for Kimetsu no Yaiba is crisp and stylish, and the animations are well made and flow nicely (unlike a lot of recently made anime).  The sound design is nice as well.
Overall: Kimetsu no Yaiba is good show that has dark themes. It is flawed, but it doesn't subtract to much from the enjoyment, and the dynamic between Tanjirou and Nezuko is nice to watch. As for whom this show might suit, I would recommend it to those who likes action and fantasy, but warn that, if you don't like blood and gore in the show, then it might not be for you (there plenty of gushing blood, severed limbs and the like).

                Kimetsu no Yaiba is an enjoyable anime but not much more than that. The animation is excellent but besides that it is filled with shallow characters and a shallow story. 
Story:3
The story is about Tanjiro searching for the demon that killed his family. It's simple but too basic and lacks emotion. The series begins with a weak first episode. We barely know Tanjiro or his family so there is no connection between the viewer and Tanjiro's family. If there were a few episodes with Tanjiro spending time with his family there would be more of a connection between the viewer and the characters. The story
                  is also just Tanjiro and his friends meeting a demon, killing the demon, resting and repeat. There isn't any depth and it just feels empty. 
Art, animation and sound 9:
The animation is the part of the series that makes it interesting but the animation is really the only reason to watch Demon Slayer. The animation is excellent and beautiful to look at and the sound feels realistic. The art is a bit basic but it works for the anime. 
Character: 3
The characters are shallow and 1 dimensional. All of the main characters have no development besides their fighting abilities. The best characters are definitely Zenitsu and Inosuke because they are always entertaining to see. The worst character is Nezuko because she doesn't even talk. Nezuko serves no purpose and is a boring character. All Nezuko does is help Tanjiro slay demons and nothing else.
Enjoyment:9
Even though I may have sounded harsh in my review I still enjoyed watching Demon Slayer. The animation and sound is the main reason I enjoyed it so much. Even though Demon Slayer is flawed it is definitely entertaining. 
Overall:5 
Demon Slayer is mediocre but fun to watch I don't think it's a very good anime but I think it's an anime you should watch if you like good animation and sound.",5,Gio_14

Finally, 2 cours, 26 episodes of KnY finished.
Like dozens of people. I couldn't say this enough. for anime studio. Ufotable always maintained stellar job/reputation in anime adaptation.
totally love their golden trademark on how the incorporated CGI and 2D amazingly. and not to mention, superb dynamic camera movement as we could see in this scene at last episode. amazing af.
love the concept of tesseract area/room like Interstellar's film.
accompanied by amazing dynamic camera furthermore~
if we're talking about praise, I pretty much ran out of it. hahaha

tbh, like most review said. its a simple shounen anime/manga with a simple premise. but the execution? my oh my. damn majestic. Ufotable took Shounen genre and created their new benchmark in anime production.
Fortunately, we go sequel for this series in movie form. and it's canon.

The anime is really good, I recommend it for those who don't have any anime to watch on the weekend, it has a very simple and creative story, its premise is also very interesting, the quality of the animation is sensational, and what sets it apart Shōnen of the others is the characters, all are very captivating and charismatic, even the secondary ones, the anime also manages to make the main character's goal unique, instead of having several goals like other Shōnen, the direction is well done, the anime doesn't focus on being a Character Drive, but it does almost the role of one, and
                  the movie that will come out just makes me more anxious. That was my assessment, thanks for watching :)",8,TubaraoOtaku

                *Little to no spoilers
Demon Slayer is an epic anime for people who have started watching anime and it sure does set the benchmark pretty high for other shounen but on a serious note, why the out of place jokes?
Lets recap the story a bit, Tanjiro, who live wit his mother and four brothers and sisters went to town to sell coal but when he returned the next day, he found all of them brutally murdered and his younger sister, Nezuko, turned to a demon. He now embarks on a journey to find how to return his sister to human. No with a dark plot like
                  this and frequent deaths, trivial jokes do seem a bit out of place doesnt it?
You will get annoyed at frequent and repetitive jokes. Even though sometimes they are important to change the mood of the viewers but most of the time, it lacks creativity.
The protagonist develops thoroughly throughout the series but you will notice little to no progress in the personality of the side characters. For starters, Zenitsu was done dirty by the creators. He shows so much potential and thunder breathing sounds cool and overpowered to have as a side character whose role was to cry the whole time but surprise surprise, He can use only one move duh! and how can we forget, why is Nezuko more famous than poor bastard Tanjiro smh...
Ending on a good note, the sounds are amazing and the art looks aesthetically cool

                Demon Slayer (Kimetsu no Yaiba) is an anime I had been hearing a lot of hype about for the past two years. I finally got around to watching it, and I was pleasantly surprised. I don’t usually enjoy shounen animes, but Demon Slayer appears to be the exception.
[Story] - 8
The plot of Demon Slayer isn’t exactly the most original thing I’ve ever seen, though it still manages to be memorable in the way it’s written. While there are certainly some annoying parts which drag of for far too long, or parts which are rushed through, for the most part, I think the story is pretty
                  solid.
[Art] - 9
The art is undoubtedly one of my favourite parts of this anime, really standing out to me. The fight scenes were beautifully animated, and I especially loved the way the more simplistic style of Tanjiro’s water effects stood out against the darker and more detailed backgrounds. Honestly, aside from very minor nitpicks, I don’t really have any complaints about the animation.
[Sound] - 7
Now, I don’t usually pay much attention to anime soundtracks aside from the openings and endings, so I’m probably not the best person to ask about it. Though, I can confirm that the song used for the opening is definitely one of my favourites from the shows I’ve watched this year.
The voice acting was pretty good, though for some reason, I found the dialogue in episode 1 to be awkward and forced. This is only an issue for the first episode though, the rest were all really well done.
[Character] - 7
Now, this is the section I had the hardest time rating, as the characters in this show differ so much in terms of likability. On one hand, we have the more serious characters such as Tanjiro and Nezuko. On the other hand, we have characters like Inosuke, who’s sheer amount of pride and stubbornness is almost as unbelievable as the fact he’s able to see out of that boar head, and Zenitsu, who can’t seem to go a single day without screaming and complaining about- well- everything. Their absurd personalities can seem amusing at first, but it’s one of those jokes that gets old very quickly.
As for the villains, I actually really liked the fact they gave a lot of the demons backstories. I think it’s an under-appreciated detail that they didn’t have to put in, but chose to anyway to separate them from your typical “evil for the sake of being evil” monsters.
Honestly, if you can ignore the annoying parts of these two and focus on the more serious characters, you’ll have pretty good cast.
[Enjoyment] - 8
As I mentioned in the beginning, I don’t typically watch this genre of anime, however, Demon Slayer was able to hold my attention throughout all 26 episodes, each ending leaving me excited to watch the next episode when I got the chance.
[Overall] - 8
Demon Slayer is a very good anime in my opinion, but it’s certainly no masterpiece. From the animation to the story, it’s a series that has some wonderful elements. However, it’s also a series that has its flaws and weaknesses, particularly with some of the characters. Overall, Demon Slayer scores a solid 8/10 from me, and I look forward to watching the movie next. I would definitely recommend watching this series if you weren’t planning to already.
Finally, have a good day/night, and thank you for reading!",8,Atsunome

                Hello there, are you tired of shonens with cliched plots and characters ?
Here for you is a shonen with cliched plots and characters :) But a good one it seems.
Let's first dig in what is done right :
Drawings are wonderful, story is not especially original but fair enough to be good, animations are nice, sound is pretty cool, characters are a bit cliched but overall nice. 
Overall a cool anime. In first eps, I rated it 10+.
But, as I'm reaching ep 17 soon (well, when it will have aired), some things begins to annoy me. And here I already see you coming and saying ""Eeeee
                  you said everything was cool to wonderful, how can it be annoying?"". Well, the anime becomes a bit inconsistent. At first it was an heavy and dark mood, with some funny cuts inside. Kind of a serious shonen. And it was wonderful. Know as for eps 14 15 16, there are both wonderful, deep and serious moments as well as nice humour, but more and more filling is appearing. Characters crying for too long, jokes kept alive for no reason etc... And it's a bit frustrating, and breaking anime rhythm. 
So, should you watch it ? YES, at least 10 first eps, and then decide by yourself. The story is still fair to watch as of ep 16, and drawings/animations are time to time wondeful. 
Let's see how the anime goes on !",8,Felix_Bertoni

                NO SPOILERS REVIEW
Kimetsu No Yaiba, one of the best shounen anime ever made in my opinion. Let me just get straight to the point.
Story (10/10):
The story itself is novel and unique. I personally never saw any other animes which have similar plotlines like KnY. On top of that, KnY, unlike other shounen animes, serves a darker plot and thrilling vibes. What makes it even special is this series doesn't cast aside their comedy side, remembering that this is a shounen anime. The worldbuilding is incredible, the MC starts from zero, after years of training, the results certainly are not disappointing, still, it doesn't make the
                  MC indomitable (or OP). If you ever heard that the MC keeps getting plot armor, it's an irrefutable fact, however, just as I mentioned earlier, the MC and friends always struggle when they face the villain.
Art (10/10):
Art? Come on, this is ufotable's product. You surely can expect some eye-catching animations. The fight scenes are jaw-dropping and exquisite, with fluid animations which make the fight scenes not look stiff. That became the sole reason why I was infatuated with this series. I'd dare to say that the animations do a great job in carrying the whole series.  
Sound (10/10):
The OST really fits the fight scene. After all, Yuki Kajiura is the one who composed the song. Therefore, she will undoubtedly present some of the greatest OSTs out there. Not to mention, the opening song, Gurenge, which was made by a renowned singer, LiSA, is now in my favorite playlist. I don't really like the ending song though. Still, it doesn't mean I will reduce the score.
Character (10/10): 
There are numerous debates whether KnY has good characters or not. Well, there is no right answer as this question is purely subjective. Some people are irritated by Zenitsu, who they thought is an annoying character, however, others, like me for example, adore Zenitsu a lot. The MC, as well, leaves controversy whether or not he receives excessive plot armor. Personally speaking, I strongly disagree (you can see my reason above in the story section). The gang (Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke) has decent character development. I don't see any problems with the rest of the characters, so let's move on. 
Enjoyment (10/10):
I was on the edge of my seat whenever I watched KnY. Hence, needless to say, I enjoy every second of this anime, no doubt. This holds a special place in my heart. 
Overall:
10/10. That's all. No other words could describe KnY except mind-blowing. Y'all should try to binge this extraordinary anime.",10,guruguru1
38000,"
                If you want to binge watch enjoyable shounen anime, this is your pick.
Let's start with the basics: The animation is so amazing it makes you scream. so good, god. something i don't see many people talk about, is that the sound and voice acting are also outstanding. And, at last, the story isn't innovative or incredible, but it sure is enjoyable. 
My complain is that for a 26 epsiode anime, the two other characters (zenitsu and inosuke) should've been introduced earlier, since they add SO much more. many people think zenitsu is the best part of the show, personally i kinda agree but also think
                  there's many other things and characters that deserve credit. 
The character design and personality picks are great. since there isn't that much female participation other than nezuko's (who can't speak), we don't have the bad anime female problem. Nezuko is the cutest demon you could imagine.  
Kimetsu no yaiba isn't for people that enjoy complex and innovatibe stuff, but rather for people that need a reminder of what good shounen is. it's great for binging, it lifts your mood, makes you happy. the slight bits of comedy and the amount of earrape are really wholesome. the character design and every single movement is so pretty, even the demons have interesting looks. right now, it's not something that has you at the edge of your seat because of the danger, but i think it will be after the 2nd season. 
if you're an artist, then it's out of question no matter what your anime taste is, this  watch is completely worth it just for the beautiful eyegasm you'll have with literally the slightest things, the characters and plot are just an addition. 
i really recommend it.",8,emabaral
38000,"
                I enjoyed Kimetsu no Yaiba for it visual flair, effective spooks, and nicely portrayed Taisho period setting, but I feel its let down by some of its writing, and especially towards the end of the series starts to feel like it's falling far short of its potential. The characters are great (aside from Zenitsu, who I find pretty grating), and in particular I love that many of the short-lived villains we see throughout the series get effective, enticing backstories with interesting little details.
I can see why this series ended up being so popular. It looks great, it has a lot of compelling details in its
                  worldbuilding and character studies, and it's adept at creating an eerie atmosphere, but it's just a shame the writing is less consistent and more disjointed for much of the series.",7,mothcub
38000,"
                Okay, since this website requires a long review. (Contains spoilers)
Now, the start of the anime had a good start. Tanjiro's family dies, the hashira lets his sister live (She should've died woulda made the story better), and yeah that's episode one for me.
I wish the story had a harder training arc at the beginning, also the story seemed like every other shounen I've watched the same stuff like always, The animation is phenomenal honestly made the story better and the opening music is very good really nice. 
It's an 8/10 because of the art and sound. I enjoyed it as my first ever anime and
                  of course, it holds a special place in my kokoro. After watching other anime's and now that i look back at it it seemed very casual. I plan on watching the movie of course, i have to finish what i started.",8,_AnPAn_07
38000,"
                Kimetsu no Yaiba is a conundrum. I was going to give it a 7, but something in me was just pushing for that 8. 
When you break it down piece by piece, it doesn’t really do anything that another anime hasn’t done before. But somehow when put all together, it rises above its individual parts and creates a gripping fast-paced heartwarming adventure. 
I think three factors are key here. First is its potential. Given the initial worldbuilding and the introduction of the primary characters, the audience is able to recognize that, despite an already solid start, this anime still has further untapped potential. There’s still
                  so much it can build on and develop into that the possibilities create an air of mystery and anticipation. Second is its emotional core. The relationship between Tanjirou and Nezuko is central to this anime. It provides a convincing and compelling main motivation and is the source of various points of tension and conflict. In other words, it’s storytelling gold and the most important factor, I think. Last is the animation, the bow that ties it all together. Aesthetically speaking, this is a beautiful anime, which makes the viewing experience definitely easier. 
For me, it’s the simplicity and strength of these factors that make Kimetsu no Yaiba work. It may not be as deep or as revolutionary as some of the other anime out there, but it tells an effective story that manages to be both emotional and action-packed.
Do I hope to see more developed characters and a more intensive and extensive world? Yes. But for now, I'm satisfied with the foundation it's built.",8,posuki
38000,"
                Being completely open, I care more for story than I care for art style.
Demon Slayer was one of those animes that I was really excited for without knowing the hype because it is typically the sort of thing I love to watch.
My main issue is that it hides behind the poor character writing and story using its amazing visuals. Visually it is one of the best animes, if not the best anime out there visually, but combined with the poor characters and fairly boring and lazily written story are big issues to try to look past.
Out of all the shounen anime I have seen (which
                  is most of them) if I had to pick one that I would rate the lowest it would be Demon Slayer. This may seem harsh, but I have seen this anime 3 times completely and it got slightly better on the second watch.
Overall, I would say Demon Slayer is an okay anime but for an anime from Ufotable it is high and quality and poor in story and character. So if you care for good art and can stand a terrible story then this is something to watch.",3,ohso_
38000,"
                *Minor spoilers*
Overall a fun, entertaining anime, but don't expect much depth. For all they go on about the sibling bond between the main character and his sister, we don't actually know much about her as a person, she doesn't speak, and spends most of her time in a box or/and asleep.
What are her feelings about being a demon? Does she have survivors guilt? Is she desperate to be human again? Does she feel lonely? Does she have reluctances about becoming human again, because being a demon gives her the power to protect people (something she failed to do as a human)? Heck, what's her personality?
                  Honestly who knows. Nezuko is more of a narrative tool than a person.
And as for some of the other demon slayers, Zenitsu's comic relief falls flat, nothing's more annoying than him constantly sobbing or shrieking. The little glimpse into his backstory was nice, exploring some of his feelings of inadequacy and abandonment, made him feel a bit more like a person, but not long after it's back to the same old routine.
Tanjiro makes a nice protagonist, I like how he still has compassion even for his enemies, but he's nothing extraordinary.
The plot's pretty mediocre too. And sometimes it seems to forget what it's doing? Like how they set up that he needs to collect blood from the 12 kizuki for research into a way to restore his sister to a human... then, when he actually fights and kills one of them he doesn't collect their blood? And there's no little moment later when he's like 'oh I was too injured I'm so sorry for failing you Nezuko' or 'woops I forgot', they just never mention it at all?
This probably sounds like I'm being too harsh... the animation was good, the fights were fun, I was entertained and it was a pretty easy watch. Can't agree with people calling it 'one of the best anime' though, it's solid but not extraordinary despite some flashy scenes. Will probably watch the next season.",7,friendlycoffee

                *Minor spoilers from the Manga and season 1 of the anime*
Now, when first watching this show I didnt quite understand the hype behind it. Yeah sure the animation was good and the fights were some what cool but the story and characters were lacking quite a bit. And to be honest I still dont get the hype and claims of how its the ""best anime of the season"". 
story: 
The story is fine, but is somewhat basic and generic. Its a typical tragic event drives our main character to achieve their goals and make things right, or get revenge and thats exactly what kimetsu no
                  yaiba does. Its story is fine, but isnt anything unique and wasnt something I found myself extremely invested into. (Rating 6/10)
Art:
Now this adaptation of the manga is absolutely stunning. The different breathing styles and techniques help make the colors and art in this show amazing. The different elements flashing across the stream out of the demon slayers swords is just so beautiful and wonderous. Compared to the manga, which fights were bland and colorless, this adaptation helps give them beauty and life and the art is definitely
a highlight to the show. (Rating 9/10) 
Sound:
The different sound effects compliment the art and fights like butter on bread. They are a great addition and sound very well done, and satisfying. Not much else I can say about that. (Rating 8/10)
Character: Now I personally dont have much of a problem with most of the characters, except for the fact that they lacked variety in personality and depth. Every single character has one character trait, and one only. Tanjiro is a kind soul who will do the right thing (at all times), Zenitsu is a whiner who cant get over nezuko, and Inosuke is always trying to pick fights with others.  Those are just a few examples of the bland traits some of the mcs have. I did find myself enjoying  some characters  but I still find them to be bland and lacking in terms of personality and depth. (Rating 6/10) 
Enjoyment:
I found myself enjoying the show despite some problems I had with the story and characters and thought it was  a great time in the end. If you are a big shounen fan then you should definitely check it out, as its a fun and entertaining time!( Rating 8/10)

                Demon Slayer is well.......... your run of the mill Shonen anime , its definitely one of the most overhated anime in recent times due to the toxic anime community who want dEpTh and GoOd WrItIng but dont even know the G of good writing.
that aside Demon Slayer is by no means a great anime at all but it's very good in what it does while it portrays the different bonds of the character in very good fashion and also the story comes out as heartwarming and is actually very emotional the characters are one dimensional but they seem rich in personality which is honestly a
                  good way to cover up your their flaws.  but besides that there still are quite some flaws in Demon Slayer, it does follow your classic anime cliche with it's characters which is no good especially for a new gen Shounen animanga, it also does very annoying things like elongate Tanjiro's training arc making it an extreme bore to watch but then it gives us no context in Tanjiro training the 10 water breathing techniques which is a clear miss out on a potentially good training arc and like I mentioned earlier the characters are one-dimensional for the most part often only showing one side of themselves as the only one side, Zenitsu is your run of the mill scaredy cat, Inosuke is your run of the mill crazy dumb guy, Giyu is the antisocial dude who doesn't react to anything  , Nezuko is well she is pretty difficult to describe lol but like I said they are filled with personality even tho they are one-dimensional , The characters and the plot may not be that good but it's not the worst of all time like a lot of people will tell you it's good in it's own way it's also very memorable due to the interactions between the characters
the Animation of Demon Slayer is chef's kiss and 10/10 no debates about it, the animating by Ufotable is done by very experienced artists so obviously it's gonna be exquisite, the artstyle is also pretty appreciable but for the more part it's the quality of the animation which is most impressive I would even argue that the Animation is this series' most redeeming quality 
it also has very good background music the spookiness gives me chills honestly and the intro and outro are just spot on as well.
The fight scenes were incredibly animated and choreographed as well and the quality is simply peak, Tanjiro and Nezuko vs Rui has to be one of the best fights in all of anime in the past 10 years, Studio Ufotable truly did incredible stuff with this and I have to give them major props for that, for pretty much making this anime which lacks a good story into something very Enjoyable, Demon Slayer despite not having multi-dimensional characters and a good story is still very memorable and hopefully they do the upcoming seasons just like they did with this one
STORY ( 4/10): Obviously Demon Slayer lacks a good story, the pacing is all over the place and OVERALL plot is just meh but I will give it a few points just because atleast there is a purpose in the story.
CHARACTERS (6/10): The characters are alright, they aren't multi dimensonal or well written by any means but they do have colorful and compelling personalities
ART(10/10): do I even have to explain?
SOUND (8/10): THE OPENING WAS FIRE, the endings? not so much
ENJOYMENT (7/10): Yeah overall I did enjoy DS and would recommend this as a starter anime",7,Yasindanish

                mkay okay first of all idk why i dont like this that much as much as the others it was a great anime ngl but for me it think it was too hyped up for whatever reason, the characters and art style are really good tho ngl but it was not enjoyable for me that much i got bored like halfway through the anime to the point when i wanna drop it but i continued anyway since i dont have anything better to do in my life. and i dont mean to offend the people that loves this anime more than i do but if
                  someone point a gun to my head and made me recite the name of the characters i would probably die i did not pay attention to the characters name that much since idc bout them i just want to see smol nezuko thats all and i dont ship tanjiro and that side pony tail butterfly girl whatever her name is since i just dont ship it idk maybe its just me, Giyuu deserves better tbh",8,Kyuwuu

Demon Slayer is one of the most hyped anime out there.  And I'm guessing it's mostly because of it's visual style and artwork.  But underneath all of that, there isn't anything that special.
The first couple of arcs were boring.  I actually stopped watching the anime for a couple of months halfway through because I lost all interest.  I forced myself to finish it later.
Here are some things that I liked:
+The sister sometimes does funny things.
+The insect master is waifu material;
+The arc in the forest, where he fights that family is pretty good actually, but almost near the end of the show.
Other than what I stated above, the show isn't anything very spectacular.  It goes through its motions and bored me nearly to death.",6,CautiousShadow

                The oh so well-known demon slayer anime was taunting me for a while before I actually started watching it. I had only heard the opening theme (which, by the way, is one of the best ones I've ever heard.) and seen a few of the characters, so my expectations weren't too high. Well, I can't say I was blown away, but I also can't say I was disappointed. Demon slayer hit the right spot and simply gave me a great time while watching it. I have to mention a few stand-out things that might make you want to watch this series more, starting with the
                  animation. I'm not sure what it is, but this anime looked so much smoother than most animes I've watched. The intense fight scenes combined with the brightly colored elemental powers of demon slayers made for one of the best looking shounen anime I've seen. Then, there is also the very unique theme of the anime centered around the bonds of siblings fighting to stay together despite the world they are in. Seeing Nezuko fight alongside Tanjiro was amazing, especially considering her situation. Over all, This was a very enjoyable anime, and I can see pretty much anyone enjoying watching it at least a little bit.",7,Yrense

Evidentemente las expectativas estaban altas, todo el mundo hablaba del famoso capitulo del anime y las rrss estabas locas, asó que al final cedí y lo vi en enero de 2020.
No le tengo especial hate y recuerdo que me entretuvo pero han pasado ya dos años y para mi este anime tal y como entro en mi vida, se fue. No recuerdo nada memorable, los personajeses eran tan vacios que no te podría escribir ni dos lineas explicando la de
                  cada uno porque no da para ello.
En fin, una MUY buena animación con una historia del montón ¿Eso esta mal? no, pero ni de lejos es una obra maestra porque es lo que hemos visto ya decenas de veces, de ese mismo año 2019 me parecieron mucho mejores Dr Stone y Vinland Saga por ejemplo.

                This series is pretty good, it won't drop your jaw or reinvent the wheel but it is something very easy to jump into even if your new to anime.
One thing that really stood out to me and hurts the rating I'm providing is the use of CGI which really destroyed some of the scenes where consistent animation would have had a much bigger impact and been far more impressive. That said it is still a beautiful series with vivid colors and great environments.
To follow up on things that stood out I very much enjoyed the sound and characters. The world felt alive and the people
                  felt real which is very important to me and the voice actors did a wonderful job bringing their roles to life.",8,Jun___

                Spoiler Warning!
There’s something gravitating about Demon Slayer. It’s not perfect, and in concept, not particularly exceptional either. It’s a straightforward sword-fighting romp as the main character, Tanjiro, completes one mission after another with his buddies, Zenitsu and Inosuke. But despite the limitations it’s given, it manages to execute with the utmost spirit, energy, style, and enthusiasm. It grants a lot of attention to backstory and motivation, but not enough to draw away from the action. It’s not exactly a show propelled singularly by plot or by character, but regardless, one thing’s for sure: Demon Slayer is overflowing with heart.
My initial observation about the show is
                  its sense of style. It’s dazzling. The vivid colors of the breathing techniques, and the absolute drip on display fashion-wise on just about everyone (except shirtless Inosuke). All of this is accented by clean and accented linework. The animation is outstanding as well, alternating with 3D animation to keep the entire show as fluid and consistent as possible. Visually and stylistically, this show is vibrant— and occasionally jaw-dropping.
Anyone who has watched the show remembers that one fight at the climax that is just spectacularly executed. But it’s not the only sequence that’s engaging; all the fights feel weighty and intense, and that’s because of tense buildups and fresh demon abilities. There’s always some establishment of stakes. We often see the capabilities of the demons unleashed in brutal ways: from brutalizing low-level demon slayers to knocking the limbs off of other characters. Never did I feel like Tanjiro was an invincible protagonist. The show also chooses quality over the sheer quantity of enemies. Over the course of the show, there are a wide variety of demon types, often requiring some problem-solving to overcome. In particular, a memorable pair of enemies lies in Susamaru and Yahaba, the former of whom throws balls and the latter throws arrows. It sounds dumb on paper, but it really works. A few episodes later, we encounter the Bop-It demon, Kyogai, whose drums have the ability to rotate the gravity and orientation of the house. Tanjiro has plenty of time to scratch his head and struggle, lending to great payoffs when he figures out how to beat them.
But there’s a lot more to Demon Slayer than it’s coolness; in fact, that’s not even its primary strength. It doesn’t require longer than one episode to realize where this show really shines: its gushing sentimentality— for both the protagonists and the antagonists alike. Oftentimes, focus is given to the main characters, and occasionally to the primary antagonist(s) of the story. But Demon Slayer does something more; it humanizes each and every foe, even if their screen time doesn’t extend past 2 episodes. Instead of throwing grunts or big baddies with no motive at us, the show puts in the effort to bring an emotional dimension to them, even if only a little. In the first leg of the show, there is a beautiful scene where the souls of the victims of the slain Hand Demon return to the afterlife. Then there’s another moment, where mid-fight, we see Kyogai’s past when he used to be a human, and the insecurities he faced. There are countless moments like these, which provide avenues for Tanjiro to be an empathetic hero rather than a standard demon slayer.
Tanjiro’s character just screams protagonist. His most defining trait is his optimism and empathy, and these traits are brought to the extremes. His emotional range is very expressive and thankfully multidimensional, which makes his presence easily watchable. We’re quickly briefed on his tragic “my family died” backstory, which is enough to serve the story. The supporting cast is decent too, albeit inconsequential: Nezuko, his younger sister, can be considered the main supporting character, though her lack of autonomy restricts her role in the story. It’s hard for her to be compelling when she’s asleep 90% of the time. As a result, she mostly exists as a heatpat receiver. The comedic duo of the quivering Zenitsu and the macho Inosuke could be considered funny to some, but I found their inclusion mostly annoying and useless. Nevertheless, all of these characters are likeable enough to carry the story forward, but they all suffer from the same problem, and it involves a storytelling strategy that Demon Slayer employs in abundance:
Flashbacks. Flashback to this, flashback to that. Flashbacks that remind us of previous events, and flashbacks that introduce new things. While I generally don’t prefer them, they can be effective if used strategically. But use them too much, and the problem arises where everything is developed in retrospect, leaving characters underdeveloped in the meantime. While we know the tragic events that befall Tanjiro in the beginning of the show, what precedes it is mostly implied. He appears to have lived quite an idyllic life with (unusually) affectionate siblings, and that’s about it. So several episodes later, there’s an emotionally powerful moment where he relates to and consoles someone that lost a loved one. How much more powerful would it be if we had been given more about Tanjiro’s experiences of grief? Instead, we see a version of him which had already accepted his past with glee. It is only when Tanjiro is literally facing a near-death experience does the show decide to give us a flashback in which we are introduced to his father *for the first time.* The climax of the show is not the time for introductions!
To be fair, “Let’s humanize the villains right before/after their death” is a strategy that has its moments. The spider demon mother’s death, in which she is beheaded in perhaps the most angelic way possible, is perfect. There’s also a scene where Zenitsu, mid-fight, reveals the insecurities and fears that cripple him. It’s beautiful sometimes, but it gets old when used so repetitively.
Demon Slayer enters its ending chapter a bit unceremoniously as the crew is directed towards their concluding mission, a family of spider demons. Since there isn’t a clear story progression beyond the Kasugai Crows sending them to the monster-of-the-day, the villain of this season isn’t really the main villain, but just a rather strong Twelve Kizuki. How does the show make up for its fairly inconsequential finale? It decides to go all-in on character development. Tanjiro, now, is not mainly fighting against physical evils, but against the story’s newfound fixation on “fake familial bonds,” and at this point the show deflates. The premise is that the villain, Rui, has “forged” a sort of adopted family for himself, which is stuck together not by genuine bonds, but by abuse and fear. Tanjiro, having a genuine relationship with Nezuko, is repulsed by this within two minutes of seeing Rui for the first time. He breaks down in a moralizing tirade, and fighting ensues. I can see what they’re going for in terms of the message here, but a severe lack of development led to a payoff that didn’t exist. Repeatedly telling us that the spider family is fake or abusive isn’t going to cut it; it takes more time to develop that than short, one-note scenes of them being mistreated. The best option here is to concentrate on the stories of one or two characters, say, the spider daughter and mother. Those two have some ripe potential in their backstories. In the instance of the daughter, she briefly mentions the time when she had a genuine friendship with someone who Rui ended up killing. Instead, we try to establish the relationship between so many different family members at once that we end up establishing nothing at all. We only see Rui’s perspective when it’s too late, viz., when he’s already dead. But hey, we got a really cool fight at the end.
Even seeing Demon Slayer’s flaws, I am still really impressed— this show is passionate. Everything it does, it executes with style and weight. And even during points where the show hits some bumps, it’s never boring. Tanjiro is a compelling protagonist, and his good nature shows other humans— but especially demons— some dignity. These moments may not be all big and profound, but I suppose they don’t necessarily have to.",7,ZeroNorth

                Yeah, that was pretty great. It lived up to my expectations, but didn't really surpass them in any way. In the end its a pretty standard action Shounen with a couple aspects that make it stand out from the rest of the genre. The characters were pretty by the books, with not much really setting them apart from characters in similar shows. That doesn't mean the show doesn't make you care for the characters, which it does, doing an especially good job with Tanjiro's origin, but in the end, you can't really differentiate his archetype from most of the other action Shounen protagonists. Inosuke and
                  Zenitsu were pretty uninteresting characters on the whole, bouncing between being annoying and slightly entertained throughout the time they were on screen.
That said, there were a lot of areas where this show succeeded with flying colors. First, I have to hand it to the production team for ending almost every episode on a pretty intense cliffhanger. It kept the pacing fast and engaging, keeping the audience hooked for pretty much the entire season. I also really enjoyed the OST. I'm really disappointed I can't find it anywhere on Spotify.
Now, of course I have to mention the animation. Throughout the show, even before episode 19, I was continually impressed by the colors, composition, and tasteful use of CG. The backgrounds were legitimately gorgeous, creating a vibrant setting for the story. It probably has some of the best animated landscape shots I've seen in any show up to this point. The animation for the special attacks of each demon slayer were also really cool. What really caught my eye though was the integration of the CG backgrounds and the 2D animation. I first really caught on to this aspect during the scenes when Tanjiro was fighting the demon that could flip rooms around. The way the animation of Tanjiro leaping from wall to wall was combined with the spinning room was so satisfying to me for some reason. The scene in the final episode with Muzan and the lower ranks of the Kizuki in that complicated 3D maze was gorgeous as well. And man, episode 19 really was something else. The animators really goated with that action scene. I literally had to pick up my jaw off the floor after that episode. I had heard bits and pieces about how the climactic fight was amazing, but I really wasn't expecting the spectacle we got. It may not be for long, but it really blows you away. Also, the use of CG in other cuts, like simple walk cycles was incorporated really well, never jarring me with a difference in the way the animation felt.
Overall, this was an above average Shounen, differentiating itself in a few key areas, but not really doing enough to make it special. I'm super excited to watch the movie now.",8,Hudsonwt

                Demon Slayer is a battle Shonen set in Taisho-era Japan. After his sister Nezuko gets turned into a demon, Tanjirou becomes a Demon Slayer in hopes of finding a way of reverting her back to a human.
The first thing you'll notice about this show is how pretty it is. Between the beautiful backgrounds, complex fight choreography, and clever use of 3D animation, this is one of the prettiest TV anime I've ever seen. The important characters have designs that really stand out, and even the background characters in crowded scenes are well-drawn.
This is the first time I have seen this particular setting. Seeing rural Japan
                  just as modern technology is starting to come to the country is very interesting. 
The premise isn't particularly innovative, but it is executed upon well. Nezuko's ability to hold back her demonic instincts and the circumstances behind her transformation had me interested from the start, and the mystery is continuously unfolding as the series progresses.
I particularly like the power system. There are various schools of combat, each focusing on a different breathing technique. The breathing itself doesn't grant the user power, but instead it is used as a way of focusing oneself in order to perform a certain attack. It highlights the difference between humans and demons: while demons are driven primarily by instinct, humans can take a logical approach to a situation.
In general, more powerful demons are able to control their thoughts and converse, but they still typically have a single-minded goal they pursue. Even Muzan is driven by this, where he seems to be self-conscious about his appearance and is paranoid about his underlings rising up against him. The most notable exception to this is Tamayo, who has developed a method of removing a demon's instincts to consume humans but is still a demon herself.
I really like Tanjirou and his friends. They all have unique strengths and weaknesses. Tanjirou himself is kind to a fault, meaning he can gain support of the people around him but sometimes struggles to kill a demon he can empathise with. Zenitsu is so self-conscious that he struggles to even try to improve himself and can't fight unless his life truly depends on it, but the one move he can use is incredibly powerful. Inosuke is physically strong and has sharp instincts, but his impulsiveness puts him in dangerous situations.
However, there were some things I didn't like. I don't like it when a character explains what is literally happening on screen. For instance, there was a scene where a demon grew 4 additional arms, after which it cut to a 3-second reaction shot where Tanijrou said: ""She grew more arms!"" This kind of thing comes up all the time in anime, and it sucks every time.
Additionally, I really didn't care to hear the backstories of many of the demons. The worst one was probably the one with drums in his body. He became a demon because he was a shut-in NEET who couldn't take criticism. Regardless of how good or bad the guy's writing was, becoming a demon is literally the worst way to handle the situation, and I can't feel bad for the guy no matter how much the show wants me to.
But the good parts of Demon Slayer heavily outweigh the bad, so I highly recommend you watch this one.",8,DeathlyPi9

                This anime, especially in today's anime, really teaches you about kindness and empathizing with the characters. The thing that I favor in this anime is how it seems to show a story with each character, and the development each character has, as well as the interaction.
If you enjoy a show with a kind hearted MC, though not weakminded, but instead has courage to defend those who are considered weaker than him, and is not afraid to look at other people's perspectives, as well as wanting to see a diverse cast of different personalities, I would suggest this. 
Not only is this show good at showing
                  a storyline and characters, but the graphics is simply amazing and different.
The only con I can say about it is that the pacing and story is a bit fast, however it's better than it just being messy.",8,mistressmadi

                demon slayer não é um anime inovador. na verdade, demon slayer se desenvolve e trabalha com muitos clichês do gênero 'shounen'; e dizer isso em algum canto da internet sempre atrai um grande número de otakus nervosos, especialmente aqueles que acreditam que esse é o melhor de seu gênero e irá seguir o caminho de sucesso de outros shounens que já tiveram seus dias de ouro, como naruto ou bleach. reações como essa também são comuns pra outros títulos como my hero academia e attack on titan.
a questão aqui é que demon slayer, por bem ou por mal, não tenta ser um anime inovador. não
                  se propõe a inventar a roda. trabalha sim dentro de uma narrativa que as vezes pode ser um tico previsível, mas não deixa de ser extremamente divertido. e não deixa de ser extremamente fiel com seu próprio universo. 
o ponto negativo é justamente sua trama bastante vertical. os arcos não se expandem pra muito além do perímetro do protagonista, o que não é de todo mal já que kamado tanjirou é extremamente magnético. mas o desenrolar da história se equipara com a de um jogo de videogame: o tutorial da fase de treinamento, partir pra jornada, encontrar amigos, fortalecer superando inimigos, se dirigir pro boss daquela fase. repetir. se lembrarmos de animes como attack on titan que, em determinado momento, põe no centro de sua narrativa o ""lado oposto"", fica mais evidente como outras tramas expandem seus horizontes e demon slayer segue uma linha bastante estreita. mas, sendo justo, attack on titan também me passou uma impressão parecida com essa em sua primeira temporada. e aqui, estou apenas falando sobre a primeira de demon slayer também.
mas se, nesse primeiro momento, demon slayer não oferece nada de muito novo em termos narrativos e não consegue fugir dos clichês de gênero, como então não falha em conquistar um público grande (incluindo euzinho)? 
de novo, demon slayer não é inovador, mas mesmo em seus clichês mais óbvios, consegue emocionar e prender o espectador com personagens absolutamente carismáticos, pontos cômicos bastante efetivos e entregar uma senhora de uma animação. se levarmos em conta que a trama é de responsabilidade do mangá, o anime em si faz um trabalho impecável em adaptar essa história pra tela: a trilha sonora mescla muito bem músicas tradicionais do período em que a narrativa está inserida com o usual eletrônico/rock que dita a movimentação das cenas de ação, e isso só favorece traços de animação que também abraçam esse lado ""tradicional"" e inclui nos movimentos e ataques dos personagens ilustrações reminiscentes do ukiyo-e.
mas mesmo que essa primeira temporada ainda tenha desenvolvido o plot de uma forma bastante usual e pouco corajosa, acho interessante como a obra no geral se esforça bastante pra abolir um maniqueísmo. mesmo o título sendo sobre caçadores de demônios - e, obviamente, trazendo demônios como forças malignas -, há momentos de reflexão reservados entre os combates que olham pra esses inimigos sob um outro escopo. não é bem aquele lugar comum do ""sofreu muito e portanto virou vilão"", mas sim uma visão geral sobre a construção dos personagens que acrescenta algo pra história principal. ainda mais levando em consideração que o objetivo principal do protagonista é salvar sua irmã, que foi transformada em demônio e não se entregou ao ""lado sombrio"" da força. 
a expectativa é alta pras próximas temporadas. algo dentro de mim quer acreditar que essa história tão vertical pode ser justificada pelo fato de ser apenas um momento de introdução dos personagens e do universo em que estão inseridos. que as coisas vão tomar suas devidas expansões nas próximas fases. mas, sendo sincero, mesmo que isso não aconteça, mesmo que a trama siga optando pelas saídas mais fáceis e previsíveis, ainda assim vou acompanhar: os personagens me cativaram. eu quero conhecer esse grupinho de vilões que aparecem escondidos nas sombras durante poucos segundos da abertura. e também quero conhecer as habilidades de todos os integrantes desse time de espadachins de elite que são apresentados nos últimos episódios. e eu quero simplesmente abraçar todos os personagens principais. a culpa não é minha se eles são tão fofos. sim, eu sou gay, como descobriu?",7,icefefo

I cannot for the life of me, understand how this manga has been outselling One Piece for years running. Granted I'm watching the anime, but this anime was so mid. I gave it a very generous 7/10. The animation and sound design are the only things carrying this anime. The story is so basic that the direction of the plot is being dictated by a f***ing bird.
The plot development does get better towards the end, sort of, which made me give this a 7/10
                  over a 6/10... but dear god people never shut up about this anime. I was expecting something grand. Talk about an over hyped, underwhelming anime. I can't believe people are so shallow that they'd actually give this an 8.55 overall out of 10.
If this show didn't have such crisp and well done animation, this show would honestly go down by two points, it would be a 6.5/10 like it rightfully should be. Listen, not trying to shit on the show everyone loves, but I honestly don't get why people hype this up to the point that it outsold ONE PIECE! SERIOUSLY? WHY GOD WHY IS THIS MEDIOCRE SHOUNEN WITH A BARELY PASSABLE STORY OUTSELLING ONE PIECE! 
I call it mid. That doesn't mean I hate it. There were enjoyable moments. If I were to say if I hate it or like it, I'd say I like it. But I cannot comprehend the massive brain damage that lead to this anime being ranked so high and outselling ONE PIECE! Echiro Oda's story and world building is so good he makes Tolkein's work look like shit, and I LOVE Lord Of The Rings.
Keep in mind, not talking about the One Piece anime. It's pacing is god awful and I have not watched it since Dressrosa. I am a full on manga simp. One day I'll read the Demon Slayer manga just to attempt to comprehend why this is so popular. Sorry for being a dick, but I just don't get this one. I don't get why it's so beloved. It's not bad, but it's just not as good as people are hyping it up to be.
Personally I think this is adored by a legion of Teenagers who need to find another anime to watch... and please don't watch MHA... it's on the same level of over hyped. Watch something good, like Gintama maybe? Or Death Parade? or Saiki K? or Samurai Champloo? or Attack On Titan? or Vinland Saga?",7,AGiantWeeb

You can only have three ways of seeing this anime.
Either you love it, hate it, or just casually enjoy it. Me personally, I find this to be an enjoyable anime. It combines a fresh story, beautiful art, sound design, and memorable characters that can make for a great experience.
The story is your standard shounen anime, a kid known as Tanjiro training to become the strongest in his world so he can revert his sister back to being a human. To me, it's pretty standard for a shounen but regardless does not mean that it is bad, it's great. The narrative is set in the
                  Taisho era of Japan and the combat system easily enticed me into this story. 
The animation is without a doubt amazing, the art style, animation, and environments feel alive to me. The art style is implemented from the manga perfectly and in a way improves on the art style. The animation feels so smooth and makes each combat scene feel more alive and realistic to me. The environment truly captures early 20th century Japan to me.
The voice and soundtrack bring the anime to life, the opening is good but can get old quickly. The voice acting brings all the characters to life and makes each of them feel unique in their own ways. Tanjiros voice actor captures Tanjiros forgiving character, Zenitsu appears as a coward but also terrifying and Inosuke is purely hilarious. the soundtrack is also perfect, fitting into each scene, the world, and the ideas that revolve around the Demon Slayer anime.
Each character is unique, each of their backstories and the main trio making the most hilarious and fun to watch characters. Combining a kind Tanjiro, cowardly Zenitsu, and hot-headed Inosuke is a perfect trio. While the presence of the Hashira and other top demon slayers. I will say, however, that Rui was slept on and could've been more amazing if his backstory wasn't fully revealed moments before he died.
A mix of enjoyable story, beautiful art, amazing sound design, and memorable characters create an enjoyable experience that can't be really found anywhere else

                  it anyway bcs i wanna know why there's so many hype about this anime. it has a good story tho. i cant get any emotion by watching it. and talk about over powered characters (all the characters are overpowered), it seems like a story for kids. in the anime, although tanjirou always said he had a tough training, i cant feel that. i can only see they having fun by passing all the training steps. i dont wanna say its not recommended. its a good anime anyway. im sorry if your opinion doesnt match mine",6,snowballwho

                there's a refreshing simplicity with how straightforward Demon Slayer tells its story. 
characters verbally announce how they feel, there aren't any attempts at convoluted world-building or expectation subversion, everyone firmly inhabits their trophy character archetypes with just enough depth and charm to let us connect. with Demon Slayer, what you see is what you get.
it's that straight-story style that makes this show so memorable and so damn accessible to everyone. despite its very anti-Western sensibilities (i guarantee most of the show's fans don't know anything at all about the Taisho Period), the emotions and the character struggles are painted in such broad strokes that it's
                  impossible not to get engaged.
it's fitting then that the show's climactic battles are complementary in their larger-than-life explosions of colorful, explosive, and in-your-face bonkers insanity. 
everything may be shallower than preferable to those with a more seasoned taste but it's not trying to be anything more, and for what it is Demon Slayer delivers its thrills and visual splendor with a soul-filled panache that's rarely ever seen in a shonen.
it's straight to the point without any fat, and sometimes that's more than enough.",8,brandotendie

                Quick review, minor spoilers.
What ufotable did to turn an average manga into a masterpiece is nothing short of amazing.
Story 7/10: it's a generic shounen that's VERY predicate, with the only twist being nezuko. Otherwise it's just 'bad guys have feelings too' kinda vibe. That said, I do think the mysteries behind certain characters are really well written and captures the readers attention,  making them crave more.
Art 10/10: wow, amazing. Ufotable smashed it out of the park. They somehow made every fight scene look like an epic. Nothing else to say really
Sound 10/10: ties in with the art, it's so beautiful done. So many tracks
                  that hit you at the right time and make you feel what you're supposed to feel x10 more.
Character 8/10: characters are really unique, it's nice to see it. Especially the hashira.  That said, it does feel like certain characters are just their as fodder and comedic gags, and haven't really contributed anything to the story, similar to a lot of other shounen anime to be fair.
Enjoyment 9/10: it's a solid anime, reminds me a lot like jujutsu kaisen and fate/stay. Its definitely worth the watch. Kudos to the studio for making a masterpiece out of a standard story.",9,owidx_123

                (minor spoilers) for me final is quite ruined.
It was quite nice and okay when we go through different opponents and their stories.
But then they show us ""rainbow"" of good guys.
Look how colorful and different they are.
In 23-24 introduced like 10 new characters and you know it was hell boring. it feels no connection to ""new characters"".
The good example of character introduction was Akatsuki from Naruto.
You can already see that they are a party, uniited.
maybe if these characters were at least introduced before instead of throwing to me a rainbow of guys it was less stressful. in last episode you get introduced like 5 characters but
                  it is only one.
i just literally watched show for 2 days nonstop. 
I wonder if 18 episodes format exist it would fit exactly here..
cause introduction of new characters and other things its about next season right?
lets wait for second season and hope that the teaser with these guys would be nice",8,ArchNiki

                • Art/animation : 9, no doubt. ufotable really hit it.
• Sound : 8, theme song is great, sfx...decent?
• Characters : 7, idk why many people hate Zenitsu but...I really love him :)) this will give you mild spoiler but, the impression that I got after reading the manga and watching the anime, Rengoku really has a big ""influence"" on the development of the three protagonists (Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke) as well as the Hashiras but unfortunately I think Rengoku part (story, background, etc.) really appears too little and this is kinda disappointing for me.
• Story : 6.5/7 I guess. Average storyline of shounen genre. In the
                  manga, some part get rushed and thanks to the anime adaptation makes it better (I'm actually a manga reader and I can say that the story is very...mainstream for shounen manga. No offense lol)
• Enjoyment : 8. The art is really beautiful, eyegasm, the music is eargasm and the voice acting is good. Thanks to ufotable and the production team, I really enjoying this.",8,eienimo

                S.
I quite like this anime but there is one sore tumb in it ... what is going on with all the female characters? Honestly, if main wouldnt be so nice and would go Berserk revenge or something I would drop it on moment's notice even as I love it otherwise.
1. His family, mostly women and children, is slaughtered and is his story fuel for his progression (he keeps recalling them, so, it is).
2. His sister is turned into a monster (demon is many times called monster) which I dont mind so much but for her it means that due to next points she is more
                  or less still just slaughter-fuel for brother's character (his mission is to turn her into human)
3. Main female role doesnt have a voice. I mean, ok, but ... why? It seriously hurts her ability to communicate her thoughts and all other parts of her are unchanged, even nails are a givaway that she is a demon and no one sees her in her box anyway so why did the writer wrote her that way?
4. Main female is constantly asleep. Like, better than dead but while her brother trains and his strength is earned, she SLEEPS FOR STRENGTH. Her strength was given to her, not earned and the only way to ""upgrade"" is to sleep or eat humans? PLEASE, JUST A BITE! I want to see her grow!
5. Main female is under hypnosis by old an guy. To love everyone as family. Like, seriously? There was a chance that she could try to be nice on her own even as a monster because she already didnt eat her brother, but now you even took away her agency for being good trough coercion from her? What is wrong with you? Entirely unnecessary! So he gets to be nice while she is tricked to be nice? Fuck off!
6. As story is structured, end game is ... her brother is the strongest demon-hunter while she gets back to being weak human or demon-feed as we call them.
Then you spice it up with 1. you are not a man (until you cant kill in a fight and jump over the house, you know, like most male population, I am sure many young boys will understand such goals are unrealistic or even harmful for their self-image as they are totally able to do that if they try) 2. His dead sister was quite agile but was too emotional so she died? 3. most demons till now were males because most people are men? 4. his first mission was to hunt down a demon pervert, which is nice from his but again, it is men fighting for women all over again (which could be solved by IDK, giving his sister a personality, like voice, ability to fight on her own, grow trough battles and such? Are demons tasty? It is a story, make her interesting! She will be there for ... ah yes, dont bother, she will stay asleep in her box most of the time, wont she?)
So, I kind of see a pattern here ...
That said, I still quite like it but it has SERIOUS ISSUE with his female ... well ... anything really. I cant say it is bad in this issue, it is just so obnoxiously lacking.
Also, that old man is a shitty teacher, for real, how many people try to kill you constantly in order to teach you something (and he didnt even want to train him for Finals anyway, so ... why train him anyway if you are going to take a shit on his effort)? Main's survival is entirely due to his OP characteristics from before he started training which wasnt explained yet. Do you get born OP? Why bother becoming a demon (it has serious limitations, like sunlight and the need for slaughter) if you can be a demon hunter on your own?
EDIT: Finished it. As expected, problems persist, but I did quite like some of mentioned interactions. I would like to share one side scene on how it could be made better, even if I quite liked it :)
So, protagonist tries to help a slave-girl regain herself. For that reason he takes her decision coin and flips it. Story implies that girl might be saved by love (which I dont think should be necessary for better messaging because now it almost looks like they are playing harem trope, just bake them good friends, someone to admire, but whatever). So, he takes her coin and flips it and it flips on the right side, she is to free herself. At first I didnt like the scene because he is clearly telling her what to do. She didnt come to terms with herself, he just used her mechanism of decision making against her. But I quite liked how he returns the coin and advises her to just keep flipping it if she doesnt like the result. That was a nice message.
Now for how to make it better, he flips the coin and it fails. Wouldnt that be a shock? But she was clearly invested in the result. So now he returns her coin and politely apologises, then notices how stressed she is and comments on it. She is upset, but it is clearly because part of her that shouldnt exist wanted to be free, so she actually outgrown the coin that has now became her fence instead of her safe space. Protagonist could point at that without any intend to change her, then casually as he goes away advice that she can flip the coin again if she wants to. Why? Because she was never before invested into results, to flip again means you have a preference that you endevour to bring forward. So as he goes away, we see and hear a coin flipping trough the air. We doesnt need to see the result. She can do it on her own.
See, wouldnt that be an AMAZING scene :D! I know I would love it, I feel nice just thinking about it :)",7,aljaz

                Kimetsu no Yaiba isn't innovative by any means, but there's no need to reinvent the wheel if you already know what works. Ufotable elevated a simple story into an amazing spectacle of art design, animation, sound design, and voice acting. Kimetsu no Yaiba knows what works in the shonen formula and runs with it. The story is simple but charming in an almost nostalgic way. This anime is popular for a good reason.
One thing about Kimetsu no Yaiba is that though it's formula is familiar, it's setting brings a bit of flair that anime of the season didn't bring. The anime is set in Taisho
                  era Japan, refreshing from the urban shonen settings. Tanjiro Kamado has simple goals, only wanting to turn his demon sister back into a human. He's doesn't have the obnoxious, savior complex that many shonen protagonists have. He is more subdued and it's a nice sight to see.",8,IdolxIdle

                If this show didn't have the huge animation budget it obviously has, half the people here wouldn't even be bothering.  That being said, I'm withholding most of my judgements because this is just season one, and the show has room to either improve or collapse on itself.
The Good
Tanjiro's empathy for the demons he slays is heartfelt and a driving force of the narrative.
Tanjiro's loss and subsequent connection to his sister is equally heartfelt.
The first major training arc has such great story building that I completely forget that the show's primary power up premise boils down to suck in more air to take down your
                  enemies.
Vampire Michael Jackson is a compelling villain, although I'm not really sure why he's here.
The Bad
Boars Head and Scaredy Cat have the same troupe almost every episode(You know who I'm talking about).  Their backstories need to be fleshed out sooner rather than later, and they need to develop out of their current habits because I cannot watch another season with them pulling these same antics over again.
No really, their troupes were overused from the episode they were introduced.  They are wasting our time at this point.
Some of these episodes are filler tier, and don't contribute anything to the overall narrative.
I will say I like where this show is going overall, and it certainly is eye candy.  I worry this show may devolve into appearance without substance.  Season 2 will be a major turning point.",8,DJAXX
38000,"
                This series is not great, but quite fine.
Many of the main characters are very one sided. Yushiro admires Tamayo, Zenitsu is a coward, Inosuke is overconfident and the love hashira loves everybody. I could go on. This is their one defining character trait, and we are sure to be reminded of that every time they come on screen. Inosuke is the exception to this because he actually realises he is not the greatest person of all time when Tomioka shows him what’s up. This was interesting, too bad it hasn’t happened for any other characters (yet?).
Tanjirou is literally Jesus. He has incomparable resolve, always wants
                  to do the utmost good and never compromises. He is not naive unlike so many other main shounen characters. He simply doesn’t have any flaws. He is not the strongest character (of course) because he is a child, so this can hardly be considered a flaw. For this reason he is also a rather uninteresting character. 
The enemies aren’t much better. So far they have been demons which simply find it fun to kill people or want more power for the sake of it. Some of them have had backstories but those don't matter since they are generic and they die in a few episodes anyway. At least they all had unique and sometimes interesting abilities. The only somewhat interesting villain was Rui, but he was so obviously evil even though he had sufficient motivation. We also still don’t know anything about Kibutsuji, he might become more interesting, but so far he is simply the main evil guy. 
We also have the usual overly expository and unnatural dialogue whose sole purpose is to inform the viewer. It ruins the immersion for me when a person says something that should be obvious to everyone listening (but not to the viewer of course!) which makes it feel like that person is saying that specifically for the viewer. This happened more than a few times throughout the series. They also say things that just happened, as if we just didn't see it ourselves. The enemies think aloud what they are going to do, even if it would have been understood just as well if the enemy just, you know, did it.
The hashira basically looked like clowns, in my opinion, when they were introduced. Everyone with their specific style, clothes, colour and one sided personalities. I also felt that they were very one sided when discussing what to do with Nezuko. They are the leading demon slayers, they should have more nuanced opinions than “All demons must die!”. 
The world also felt quite small. It’s not until the very last episode we learn what relationship the demon slayers have to the general society. And the only conflict is basically between the demon slayers and Kibutsuji, nothing else (that we know of) is going on in the world. If demons are such a big threat to humans, one would think that the demon slayers should be more famous or appreciated, but I digress. Maybe I missed some expository dialogue and we actually do know this.
Apart from all that, the series was okay. It wasn’t boring to follow, unlike so many other series I’ve seen. The animation is stunning, but I hardly need to say that. Not one of the greatest in my opinion, but very watchable and on the whole enjoyable.",6,Lofen

                I've been in a mood for some shonen lately, and as jujutsu kaisen is on a short break I figured I'd give this bad boy a whirl since so many people have heaped praise on it. TL;DR this anime doesn't live up to the hype, yet its stellar blending on art and CG make it an above average enjoyable ride.
Story and character wise, well, it's got fairly typical characters. Really nothing special, pretty much standard shonen stuff. Story is also pretty bog standard, verging on painfully cliche at times but it's shonen so I can't be too harsh. 
Really the meat and potatoes of this
                  anime is the animation and art. This is some of the best modern CG in anime I've come across, they meld stunningly beautiful background art with CG. This is coming from someone that absolutely loathes modern CG in anime, as an example I think Land of the Lustrous is overrated uncanny valley CG trash, that is how much I hate CG. So for me to say the CG is used well in Demon Slayer, I mean it. That being said it still needs work, you get hints of uncanny valley here and there, always at the typical CG stumbling points like walking in regard to the background. You get that weird 3d feel in a 2d world, really pulls me out of the anime, however it's not too bad in Kimetsu no Yaiba.
As for the art itself, hot damn, that's all that really needs to be said.
Sound is okay, some of the voices are a bit grating (those wicked witch female cackles in anime absolutely slay me, and my ears for that matter). Music is pretty good, it has a kind of feudal fantasy Inuyasha vibe going for it that works well, nothing absolutely banging but solid nonetheless. Music is very subjective so, YMMV.
Not a whole lot of fanservice bait either, mainly pops up in regard to the MC and his need to ""protect"" a female character that could whip his ass six ways to sunday, but I guess it's to be expected, the whole white knight fantasy in anime is going to be a hard one to kick. At least it keeps it to a tolerable minimum, so it gains a solid point for that.
If you like shonens and you've been sleeping on Kimetsu no Yaiba give it a whirl, I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you have stayed away because you loathe modern CG in anime definitely give this one a try, it gives me hope that CG will someday actually look good in anime.",8,gakinotsukai

                My first 'real' shonen action anime so I may be biased and clueless to what my expectations are and how much i liked it but I really loved Demon Slayer. I think there were so much aspects that I fell in love with and with that, I'll dive to each point.
I absolutely adore the art style, I think even if art style is more of a bonus and not the most important part of an anime: this was so worth noting! the colors are so beautiful, the detail that went to each characters' patterns, colors and clothes were just wonderful. there was so much attention
                  put into the little things and I appreciated it.
Music was nice, they were either very japanese classical instruments or big ensembles and I loveddd how they turned out. It really gave an authentic ambiance to the time period and the setting so i think it was very well incorporated. 
The MC !! I love tanjiro. like I love him... I think that his character was so sincerely made and I love following him around, it's great that he's a strong main character. as for the other characters, I feel like they lacked any form of development overall which was a big downside, there were so many and we got to see a lot of pasts and stuff but development wise is pretty miniscule.
Pacing was also very off at times, like we have fights stretched out to 2-3 episodes and for what?? i guess it's okay because I binged it together but overall it makes for a very choppy and inconsistent watching experience and definitely bothered me sometimes.
I think the comedy aspects were also very off-balanced. about 12 episodes or so were very serious and solemn but zenitsu and inosuke came and everything turned to a comedic, buddy-cop out of nowhere which was very off-putting at times. I know I'm not the only one who gets annoyed easily at zenitsu so i'm not even gonna go there but yeah,, i think it was weird to be very funny towards the very end.
But then,, there were the fight scenes. and wow. I am in love. they were animated to such perfection and especially the biggest showdown in episode 20 was just excellent. I think there were a lot of really cool moments like that which really brought the show to a different level and I enjoyed it thoroughly.",8,amandont

                Short Review (minor spoilers regarding characters)
7/10 for Season 1. Beautiful art, some interesting characters, and most importantly, the show is basically Inuyasha on a lot of drugs. 
This anime is the current new king of shonen, and I was told that Tanjiro is one of the best male anime characters ever. Let's try to find out about the actual quality of it.
Pros:
+Art. Mostly very solid animation, more seamless blending of 2D and 3D elements than most other shows. Effects of slayers' special moves are particularly memorable and stylistic. Tamayo's flowery special moves are my favorite. 
+Some strong characters. Tanjiro is certainly one of the most
                  compassionate anime heroes. His sister is an ideal waifu in many ways too. But my favorite character on the show so far is Tamayo the demon doctor. She's as graceful and selfless as they come. Some character designs are also special, as the feminine beauty of them are very pronounced without much objectification/erotic depictions. 
+Solid combat/fight scenes. 
Cons:
- Story. The further the story goes, the more it resembles Inuyasha. I am not even talking about superficial similarities like special moves/upgrades/traditional Japanese elements. I am talking about the whole quest, core conflict between the heroes and the main villain, down to characters and sympathetic enemies/demons with tears. I wouldn't be surprised if the series finale went down as a shot-for-shot adaptation of Inuyasha's finale. It's not inherently a bad thing though. But to be fair, this storyline and related themes have been quite fully explored by Inuyasha. That said, whether Demon Slayer can do something drastically new or impressive in later arcs remains to be seen.
- Too many over-the-top stubborn or hysterical characters. Though both Zenitsu and Inosuke are charming in their own regards, having them acting hysterically 70% of the time is tiring. 
- Tonal issues. The show tries to create levity in the bleak scenarios by having the heroes play out their immature shenanigans in the most hysterical and exaggerated ways, which for me, went too far past what's considered good humor. And these scenes go on forever. I remember 1-2 episodes mostly consisted of Zenitsu yelling the roof off. Is that really necessary? Wish the show can manage its overall R-rated tone and mature/layered characters in a more balanced way. 
- Too many characters sharing the same face. During one scene where a dozen slayers are present, I thought I was watching clones. Many female characters, as beautiful as they come, are also practically indistinguishable, down to their yandere eyes/subtle expressions. 
Conclusion: Not a bad Shonen. In many ways I am beginning to understand why it attracted so many female fans and became virtually the definitive Japanese national show. Hope it differentiates itself enough from Inuyasha, in a good way.",7,JoexySun

                Demon Slayer is currently a media juggernaut in japan, the manga has broken tons of records, the newly released movie is shattering the box office, and the hype for season 2 is immense. Make no mistake, this is one of the biggest shonen anime of all time, and all I can say is that it's undeserving. It's a good show, no doubt, the action is on point, the animation and designs are spectacular, but everything else is pretty mediocre. the writing of the series, or at least the anime, is at best, predictable, and at worst, straight up bad. plots and new story elements are
                  thrown in at a whim, the writing often feels like the author wrote themselves into a corner and now has to throw in some arbitrary new thing to get out, and things are just not thought out well at all. the writing of demon slayer is sub par, but the shows saving grace is the animation, voice acting, and action. You don't watch this anime if you want a well constructed plot or deep characters, you watch it to see cool guys cut bad monsters heads off, and that's really all you should watch it for. speaking of the characters, they're pretty flat. Tanjiro, the main protagonist, feels like every good guy shonen character, just with less charm and overall personality. His 2 main allies aren't great either, Inosuke is a fairly standard dumb brain who screams a lot, and Zenitsu is a coward who is only cool when he falls asleep. they all fall into standard ""funny coward"" or ""stoic good guy"" or ""dumb dumb poo poo brain"" archetypes that never really evolve past those. I liked the show, but not for the reasons one would want to like an anime. if it was smaller, maybe, but its such a titan both in japan and here that it just kinda irks me that people worship such an ""eh"" quality series.",7,HeyItsSamir

                There are no words that describe how much I love this anime series. From the gorgeous graphics to the unbelievably good storyline, this anime is everything. 
The show itself is about a young boy called Tanjiro Kamado, who's sister turned into a demon. He joins the Demon Slayer Corps in hopes of turning her back into a human.
There is no doubt that this is an action-packed show filled with twists and turns. It has moments that will make you want to cry, moments that will launch you over the moon in joy and much, much more. It has the perfect balance of everything.
It takes you
                  on a journey. It shows the struggles Tanjiro encounters while on the path to find a cure. 
This anime is absolutely phenomenal. It takes you on an adventure in just twenty-six episodes. It is a true masterpiece.

                I was going to give this a 5 out of 10, but then it grew on me. 
When I first watched the first 7 episodes, I dropped it and forgot about it. The main plot felt like a story I had seen many times over before. And none of the characters intrigued me, which made my viewing experience harder, which is a shame. Tanjiro had no special charm to him and was just an overall boring protagonist, to me at least. He's not bad but I just couldn't get myself to care for him. It felt like a typical Shounen anime that didn't intend to
                  do anything special. While that's not a bad thing, I just couldn't get invested enough to continue watching. However, I came back to it because I thought ""Eh, I'll finish it, why not."" So I took my time in watching it, still not being too invested in the plot and boring characters, and Zinetsu is one of the most annoying characters I've ever had to watch. The only good one's I really liked were Nezuko and Inosuke because they were interesting and a sort of comic relief characters.
Then I kid you not, once I hit episode 19, I binged the rest of season 1 in one sitting. Definitely an amazing episode and standout. No wonder it was talked about so much! But that also has to do with Shinobu's introduction because I just knew she would be my favourite, and she indeed was!
Demon Slayer is slow-paced and creates a set-up for what's bound to come, and it's pretty good and intriguing now that I have finished the first season. While I don't mind things that are slow-paced, it was just a little too slow and simple for my taste. It is predictable but seeing how the characters achieve their goals in a somewhat cool and unique way is good enough to justify its predictability. And comedy is very good, it's more humorous than I anticipated it to be.
This isn't bad, but it's not something groundbreaking. The animation is obviously next level for what 2D animation is capable of with its unique art style and it is so breathtaking to watch! And the fight scenes are absolutely amazing along with the great choreography! Just watching it for the animation and fight scenes alone is worth it. It's mainly the writing and pacing that didn't do it for me. It felt pretty mediocre and I was kind of let down from what I had anticipated it to be. 
I like it and I'll continue to watch it, but it's not amazing. Pretty overrated in my opinion.",6,ellbelzmckelz

Because it is a comfy watch. 
I don't think that it makes much sense to write down what KnY is about, what drags its down and what lifts it up. Everybody knows that the art, direction and sound is mindblowing and that the story and characters are mediocre. If you're looking for deep insights into the human psyche or other revelations about the grand scheme of things then KnY won't be your cup of tea. But if you're looking for things like this you would be a fool to look for them in an Anime like that.

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME MINOR SPOILERS. PLEASE WATCH AT LEAST THE FIRST FEW EPISODES BEFORE READING. 
Ok, so this anime was very hyped up. I heard lots of good things about it, and only got to watching it just recently. After hearing all this praise about it, I'm just kind of confused why people like this SO much. But, there are some good parts. Let's go over what I liked, and didn't like in Demon Slayer, or Kitmetsu No Yaiba.
Story 6/10:
Wow. I do not like the story in this anime. The beginning was probably its peak in writing. A boy comes home and sees his
                  family all killed by demons and his sister is a demon. That's good writing, it builds suspense! I love the backstories of the demons, although they did stop the action, but I didn't mind too much. Also, the arc with Rui and the mountain was so good! This show also has good cliffhangers in its episodes. But, other than that. The writing falls short. I don't get why we have to watch a movie to find out what happens next! Just cut out the part with Tanjiro and his friends training and we can see the final fight! Also, there is way too many random conveniences for the characters! ""Oh you're hurt? Here, have this medicine this woman gave to me yesterday that we NEVER SAW."" So, the story is mediocre. 
Art 9/10:
This anime has some of the best art I've ever seen. Especially in the fight with Rui. Although, what's keeping this from being a 10/10 is that other than the action scenes, it kind of drops in quality. Sure its sure great and better than most anime I've seen, but when compared to the great almost 3D like animation in the action scenes, it doesn't look too good. Other than that, the art is great!
Sound 8/10:
I love the music and voice acting. The theme song is good, but the Ending song is 100 percent the best song in the show. I don't have much to say about this, but it has some good songs and music.
Character 9/10:
The characters in this are really well written! I like Tanjiro as a main character, because he's not some copy and paste shounen protaganist. The side characters are alright. Although, I'm sorry but I dislike Zenitsu a lot. I don't hate him, partly due to seeing his backstory, but other than that, he's an annoying coward. I get that that's how his character was written to be the sort of comic relief, but the relief I feel is when he's not on the screen. The funniest thing about this character happened during Final Selection where everyone had massive crows and he had this little bird. But yeah, the characters are good too.
Overall: 7/10
This was definitely one of the most overrated animes I've ever heard of. But, I can see how people can really like this show. But, for me, the story and some bad characters bring my score down to a 7/10.",7,PretzelDawg

Everyone says this series ""lacks plot in spite of the amazing art"". That may be true in some senses, but not all of them. 
Yes, it is true that the plot is insanely cliché: a boy sees his family being brutally murdered and watches as his sister turns into a monster. Because of that, the guy now seeks revenge. It is also true that the show is completely full of filler episodes, especially in the end, but they're building up tension to the second season - I think we all can excuse that.
Character-wise, the plot starts to flourish. Yeah, the mains
                  are the (also) cliché troupe of ""the good guy"", ""the angry guy"" and the ""brutally stupid guy"", but I also think that at least Tanjiro has a good inner perspective going on. It's rare to see a protagonist that doesn't really care about getting his revenge. Tanjiro's a good soul, who wasn't corrupted by hatred. Kanao is also a good character and I really wish the show would put her on the center of attention - I really think that she has the potential to become one of the favourite characters in the show. Also, I'm really sorry, but I just cannot like Zenitsu (at least they toned his god awful screams down near the end, it was getting in my nerves). 
The art was outstanding, and I do think we all agree on that. I mean, every single pannel is creative and innovative, and I simply loved the atmosphere they created combining a certain type of old japanese art to the show. The fight scenes are perfectly made, as well as the katana movement (yes, I am a sucker for swords. sorry!). Also, can we talk a little bit about the character design in this show, especially with the Hashiras? Every single one of them has so many potential! I really want to see more of them, know a little bit more of their life and their backstories. Especially Rengoku, Kanroji, Uzui and Himejima. They all appeared in only one episode and already marked the series so much.
Overall, I think this anime is pretty good. Not perfect - actually, far from that, plotwise - but entertaining. And, at the end of the day, everyone's seeking for something to have fun with. I consider myself to be pretty excited for the next season - I hope they'll show more fights and deepen the plot a little bit too.",8,acidycat

                The story is pretty good actually , (a kid becomes a skilled swardmaster to find a cure to his little sister whos turning into a demon ) -however the way that the story is represented is the problem . poor dialog and forced monologs are every ware .
downs:
-characters seems to have no motives -one moment they do something and the other they do something completely deferent- seem like they do things just because the author wants it to be done no need for logical reasons.
-talking about characters most of them has like 2 attributes (one character even said the same word like 7 times in
                  one conversation )
-bad basing in the first 10 episodes
-the way the main character Overcome obstacles is unreasonable !
(one time he just gain a new power with no logical explanation ,but he remembered it from his childhood . I know its common in anime that the hero just gain a new power but this is stupid and u have to change ur poor taste guys)

                A pretty good anime although nothing groundbreaking. I was pretty hooked and was watching 8=9 episodes a day so I cleared through it pretty quick. The title says it all what you are in for. A kid becomes a demon slayer his sister became a demon which is an interesting part and hes trying to cure her. Which gives purpose to the main character.
Sadly though he isn't really all that interesting Hes a one-dimensional character. Its a Simple Anime so thats not always bad but as a character he can be a bit boring as hes the cliche im gonna do my best overly positive
                  goody good hero who never faulters from that stance. Pretty much all the characters in this are. He runs into two more companions later on and im not good with remembering names but there another demon slayer he meets thats all brawn no brains , always wants to fight, who wears a bores head. The other is a total Spaz and freaks out about everything and is constantly screaming in fear. about everything but when his back is against the wall he changes into a calm warrior. They aren't bad characters but they arent anything all that special either. 
His sister Nessico never says a word as shes gagged the entire time. Other characters show up now and then as well, but the focus is on the first 4 I mentioned. The main villain is a bit interesting as hes a demon thats married to a human woman and his a human kid. so im interested as to what this guy all about. 
The animation and art are very well done. This anime is some very nice production values 
The voice acting is fine. Spaz's screaming about every thing did get on my nerves a bit.
Im hoping this doesnt end up being 100+ long anime I have two more sags to watch of this. This doesnt feel like an anime that really needs to beyond 50-55 episodes.
Over all its enjoyable so far. The action is pretty good and i want to keep going with it.",8,ArkonBlade

                This my first review on MAL, but not my first completed anime season. I decided to start with this short review because I have a hard time understanding all of the overhyping AND all of the shit takes on the series so far. For me being an “anime only” viewer, this story is only just getting started.
Let me get my negatives out of the way since they are very small. Personally, I am not a big fan of big time jumps. I feel like there is a lot of story missing in the beginning that could’ve served well for character development. We could have a
                  little story to what the family was doing the night of he attack while Tanjiro was still gone..we could have some time with Master Urokodaki speaking with a sleeping Nezuko about protecting humans..we could definitely use a bit more time in the Final Assessment part of the story.. I felt that some of the filler content later in the season could be used to tell these stories with less flashback time..
Overall the story and animation is good, I still feel like there is more to be told here before it becomes a discussion about “masterpiece”, so it’s a TBD situation for me..
The animation is great, the music is solid, I think most of the characters make sense.. I’m not a big fan of comedy mixed in with horror, but Zenitzu and Inosuke provide a little bit of the way in balance to keep it from becoming “depressing”. Their silliness is a little overdone at times, but not enough to turn me off the show. 
I am very interested in seeing the story progress from this point.",7,JBuford300

The plot is not from this world...dude lost his family and turned one of his sisters into a demon by some bigbad demon, so he's going to kill him in the end. I'm going to be surprised if that doesn't happen but we all know it will. And of course all the power comes trough breathing, obviously. I mean sure, whatever, we have it all in Anime, there's nothing new to do so I guess it's OK
The use of CGI is good sometimes, other I just don't like it. I'm not a fan of CGI in
                  animation, it's not my taste. When there's no fight going around the animation is normal to bad. IDK man there's no life in those eyes, there's no movement.
Sound: IDK, nothing stands out, haven thought about the sound so I guess a 5.
The characters are quite generic. There's no 1 that stands out. I don't remember the names and I won't look them up, but the 2 friends are quite annoying, especially yellow hair dude.

                Demon Slayer is one of those anime that is both incredibly overrated but still over-hated. It's really not that bad, it's still only the first season so you can't judge the story too much. At first I wasn't too interested, but the last few episodes got better. 
I really don't understand how anyone can give this anime anything over a 7/10. I found SAO's plot more interesting and Tanjiro is only barely better than Kirito as a protagonist. I somehow didn't notice how annoying Asta was when watching Black Clover, but MAN was Zenitsu annoying. I wanted him to die every second he was on
                  screen. 
The good animation, incredible art, and great soundtrack are the reason so many people are obsessed with this anime because realistically, there isn't much else there... However, just because the story and characters aren't amazing doesn't mean the anime is trash. The characters/plot are at worst a 5/10, which combined with the great audio and visual aspects can't make this less than a 6 or 7. 
I think Demon Slayer is a very good adaptation of the manga, but the source material didn't give it much to work with.

                Absolutely gorgeous animation and choreography for the fights. I had doubts about CGI in anime for years and this show has shown me it could be done not only unobstrusively but also amazingly. They make sure to make motions and impacts exciting and since this is almost entirely in CG, a lot of traditional animation cheats aren't as prevalent (Like line backgrounds to fake motion.)
The story is pretty basic. Uninspired but not painfully so. Some of the characters make up for the poor plot.
Surprisingly, or unfortunately, the show is front-loaded with its worst episodes. The blandest and most boring episodes are all in the first

                I don't have any funny or insightful introduction to this review, so let's just jump into it:
Story: 6/10
Although the world, ""magic"" system and story are not very original, it's all different enough from what I've seen before to be enjoyable to follow.
However I also have to impact the score here due to the heavy spam of flashbacks (Bleach-like), both for storytelling purpose and classic ""My friends are counting on me"". There are far better ways to build a story, and many flashbacks are simply pointless, simply wasting time before the story continues/next cool fights happen.
Art: 10/10
I originally went with my guts for a 9, but
                  then couldn't find anything wrong with art, so here's a 10.
Sound: 7/10
One of the rare anime in which I can go through the opening and ending without tearing my ears apart. Otherwise, ambient sound & music are good and fit well in the flow of the anime.
Characters: 2/10
Here is the major issue I have with this anime: While some characters are alright, so many are completely idiotic, either complete archetypes with little extra depth or straight morons.
Hopefully that'll evolve with season 2, but for now, for me, characters are the main deal breaker, that impacted...
... Enjoyment: 5/10
I'm saddened to score this one so low. Overall I appreciate the story, love the fights, but characters completely kill the fun. ""Wow"" moments become ""shut the f... up moron"", ""freaking move/talk..."" or so.
In addition, humor completely falls flat, comedy is forced exclusively through character traits, rather than situation or as part of the story. Despite the very many attempts, Demon Slayer never had me even smile, quite the contrary.
Overall: 7/10
Despite how characters heavily impacted how I enjoyed this first season of Demon Slayer, being as objective as possible, it is still a good anime. If you can get past its defects, you are likely to have a nice time watching Demon Slayer.
Despite the little fun I had, I'll give the next season a try, with hopes that characters improve, and both them and the story get a little bit deeper.",7,S1n1st3rW0lf

                Okay, hear me out. 
I am not the biggest fan of Shonen anime, the story is mediocre, the art is a brush above good, the sound is fine, the characters are boring, 2 dimensional blobs, and it is far from being a masterpiece. 
So, why watch it? 
Well, it's awesome. 
This is an anime that does not pretend to be more than it is, this isn't bleach having 400 plans and villains scheming in the background and politics 
This is not Naruto world building 600 characters into it's plot and fleshing them out even if you don't care with multi flash backs mid action
This is
                  not Ranking of kings which tries to have a plot and sacrifices all the action for a D tier story. 
This, is high paced in your face constant action, with ever growing enemies that get more powerful while the protagonist get's a little more powerful slowly. 
Sure, the protagonist is boring, but the action carries this show in an incredible way, because when the fights do start, the camera work, the cinematography is an emotional rollercoaster that knows when to build up a slow pace to tease you and when to go 80mph in your face
You will not see two buff dudes slapping their swords together and then jumping out an explosion cloud and puffing hurt as if something happened, people get hit for real, and there are actual stakes and motivations behind these fights that aren't just, bad guy vs good guy. 
Is this a great story? No. Is it an animated masterpiece? It's pretty good Is this an instant classic? No. Not at all, but what it is, Is one of the most enjoyable Shonen I have ever seen, that leans into what made people fall in love with this genre",9,DearlyBelobed

                Demon Slayers starts out very clumsy with repetitive dialogue and shonen tropes to the max. However, it really picks up the pace as time goes on with the introduction of Zenitsu and Inouske leading the way. Around episode 14 or so I couldn't stop watching and was addicted to the beautiful animation and harrowing story that began to take shape. The sound design and art style of this show are really what makes it so enjoyable. I rember when I was first watching with some friends how moving and touching the score was throughout those first episodes. Can't wait to see what they have in
                  store when I see the movie and 2nd season!

                i started this thinking i would have to give a ten for the animation itself, but.
the story is pretty basic with the location of japan. 
the art is outstanding, top quality.
sound is great and the op is a banger, tempo fits and all. 
characters are really generic and have nothing special about them. tho, i do actually quite like tanjirou. his looks are cool, stand out enough and hes not a total crybaby (still a kid tho). so through the first episodes (whhere jhe even is more emotional throuighout). at this point i was on about a 9 rating. the problem came later when introduced
                  to his future partners. i can somewhat handle inosuke but zenitsu, oh man. zenitsu alone ruined the entire vibe. i found him more annoying then i did asta at the start of black clover, a show i later came to love. 
this show is almost a masterpiece even with its basic and thin plot. but its main probglem is ""humor"". 
it has no place in this anime and the humor itself is awful, out of place and just cringe. 
overall very happy nad sad wit h this show. if it would run for 200 episodes it can become great and outgrow itself. just like black clover did for me.",8,androhzki

                It’s been a long time since I’ve been as disappointed by a show as I’ve been by Demon Slayer. On paper it’s a show that, by all rights, I should have loved- a fantasy setting, old school Japan, cool sword fights, a really unique and cool art style, etc. Unfortunately, the story is so generic and the characters so flat that I found myself bored out of my mind the second the show stopped distracting me with the amazing spectacle that is Demon Slayer’s animation nearly every time.
I think everyone who’s aware of Demon Slayer has heard someone or another say that the animation is
                  gorgeous, and it’s true! Pair that with some fun and unique villain powers, a cool art style, great character design, and an excellent soundtrack that’s almost always tied perfectly to the choreography, the show is a surface level spectacle to be sure. I genuinely enjoyed these aspects of the show, and because of them I’m glad that I did watch it once.
That being said, the story, pacing, writing, and especially the characters are the exact reason that I will be watching it /only/ the once. The story is generic with generic execution for the most part, and the pacing is frankly terrible. All of the scenes in the series feel oddly disjointed from one another. In particular, the humorous scenes are oddly soulless and feel extremely out of place in disjointed in the way that they are utilized.
And the characters. The CHARACTERS. I’ve never been so unimpressed with the writing for every single character in a show. Zenitsu and maybe a touch of Inosuke are the only ones shown to have any level of depth at all, and even that is very shallow. Nezuko would have to be the greatest offender, as she’s handled so poorly I hesitate to call her a character at all. I understand that it can be difficult to give personality to a character who can’t speak, but they don’t help themselves with the way both the show and its characters treat her like some kind of cute animal without sentience. 
There’s an especially odd part towards the beginning of the show regarding Nezuko where she is hypnotized not to attack humans, but instead of just making it that, they make her see humans as her family? Like, when she looks at humans instead of seeing the actual people her brains forms images of her dead family over them? So she’s weirdly like cuddly and affectionate with all humans? And everyone acts like this is just swell and not like, a gross and cruel violation of someone’s mind and free will? Here again she is treated like she doesn’t have sentience, like she’s not a person with thoughts and feelings. Which is an absolute shame, because her design is adorable
Without the animation and music this show would easily be a 4 or 5 at best. However, they are still positive traits of the show, and as such are enough to bump my official rating up to a reluctant 6. Worth a watch for the spectacle, but don’t expect a very emotional connection",6,HannaSensei

                In fact, the way Kimetsu no Yaiba writting is quite mediocre, but its visual quality, charisma of characters and construction of an interesting mini-world can save the anime.
The season starts off extremely slow, taking too long to hitch and turn what Kimetsu really is. The biggest problem with this relationship is that during the same, she doesn’t even try to develop Tanjiro’s relationship with Nezuko or their father, instead aniem focuses on training and pure training, putting some moments that show the concern Tanjiro with his sister, but nothing big. I believe that if this initial arc developed the relationship between the two and started
                  talking about their father, the anime could have been much better. But I believe that these are Kimetsu's only mistakes, but the fact that they are precisely at the base of the plot, everything is very damaged.
To carry the poorly worked relationship between Tanjiro and Nezuko, we have the incredible relationship between the main trio. Despite being secondary, both Inosuke (in fact, I'm writing this review on his birthday) and Zenitsu, both present extremely charismatic dramas and personalities. Inosuke's way of finding himself the best in the world, but melting for any compliment or attention due to his lack of family love is beautiful; or Zenitsu's lack of confidence and self-esteem, extremely well addressed in its need to be loved. Not to mention that the relationship of the 3 is wonderfully genuine, they fight, curse each other, talk happily and laugh like friends in real life do, scenes like them in the room of the old woman's house or they talking while walking give an air of naturalness and humanization to the anime.
Talking about humanization, we have the best of Kimetsu. The way the enemy is extremely respected, he is not a simple being that exists to be killed as in Fire Force, in Kimetsu they are human, with their own common feelings and desires, but they must be killed for their potential risk. Kimetsu no Yaiba's ability to develop feelings and motivations in each of his secondary villains, making the viewer understand their understanding of the world and their mental positioning, is simply phenomenal.
Not to mention relations with the well-worked hierarchy in Kimetsu, for this we have the Hashiras, who would be the greatest rank of the demon-killing group. I enjoyed the way the weight of their positions is placed in the work, the tension and fear of the presence of each one in each character in the work is extremely well done, making it understandable the fact that they are very strong even without ever we’ve seen them fight. The Shinobu drama, the open doors for Tomioka's development and the curiosity to see the other Hashiras in action, are things that will want to keep me seeing Kimetsu.
Finally, we have the visual quality of the work, simply beautiful, I am not just talking about the famous episode 19, but about all the sequences, such as the fight between Tanjiro X Inosukue, the fight between the house that spins and the fight between the demon of arrows, and episode 17, all just beautiful scenes. The beauty of the work and the ability to put funny facial expressions on his characters are indeed something that has carried Kimetsu's popularity.
Note: I would like to say that I reviewed dubbed, so I don't remember the original voice actors, but I can say that Inosuke and Zenitsu in both Japanese and Portuguese are phenomenal and that I played on Tanjiro speaking supportive words.
In short, Kimetsu no Yaiba is an excellent punching shounen, with captivating characters, humanized enemies and beautiful animation, despite sinning in working on his main topics (Kamaboko Tanjorola's family relationship). And yes, the final arc is the best, the one of the spiders is just interesting, episode 19 is only beautiful in animation because in real plot it is very bad, 17 is much better.

Demon slayer S1 , anime which didn't have much good story but with use of perfect background music, OSTs and emotions of character .It did a good work 
*Story* : First 3 episodes were fully generic shonen actually more generic added to it . Next episodes improved the world building , mostly pacing in some arcs was not that good , plot holes left as they are .
*Animation* : This is where demon slayer wins the match , ufotable made a top notch animation . Fight scenes animated on next level and because of that it covered space somewhat   where story wasn't good
                  
*Action/Fight scenes *: I wouldn't say the best but it was pretty good 
*OST*: Over here again it was like a king , Gurenge by Lisa one of the top openings in my list , background music created the suspense needed in the story , overall it was top notch 
*Characters*:  It has introduced many characters such as inosuke , zenitsu, Hashiras and some more . But still in S1 only some of characters have the development needed . 
This review was totally based on season 1 so no spoilers for S2 mugen train and entertainment district arc , also I have read the manga . So I know many cool things are coming on the way , it will get better in next seasons

                Demon Slayer is a great anime. I agree it is not the best Shounen and has its flaws but it deserves its recognition.
Story 8/10
A very typical Shounen storyline. MC has a dead family and proceeds his journey to find a solution to cure his demon sister. Although this kind of story is recycled, Demon Slayer is somewhat interesting and managed to capture my attention.
Art 10/10
Art is aesthetically pleasing. Animation is very impressive. 
Sound 7/10
Gurenge by LiSa is one of the most iconic anime song. Other than that there isn't anything good worth mentioning. I know many viewers favourite moments are ep19 when Kamado Tanjiro no
                  Uta is played but I seriously have no memory of that song because it didn't leave any impression to me.
Character 5/10
The characters in Demon Slayer are really annoying. Only Nezuko is cute and lovable. Tanjiro is ok I guess but I got annoyed when he gives compassion to all the murderer demons. The other 2 characters are really the most annoying sidekicks I have ever seen, both of them seem to be in the anime for humor purpose but I always cringe when they are doing some kind of lame jokes.
Enjoyment 9/10
One of the few anime that I got hooked easily. It is easily enjoyable for almost anyone. The only downside is I didn't get emotional or sad at all even though many others cried in ep19. It just felt very normal to me.
Overall 8/10
This anime is worth a try for people who never watch anime before. It is easily light and easily digestible for first-timers. There are definitely some flaws in this anime but it is worth watching.",8,Bernardyuankun
