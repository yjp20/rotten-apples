                To be honest, Naruto is the most overhyped show in existence. Everyone goes on and on and on about how great it is; and my expectations for this show was equally high. However, I was really, really let down. Really. This wasn't the best show ever, as I had thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, the show is enjoyable, but it's definitely not among the best shows out there. I hope Shippuden will better than this... much better.
The concept of this show isn't that hard to follow. It's an alternate world in which ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and
                  they have this power flowing inside of them called chakra. Chakra is used to perform powerful attacks which (usually) belongs to either of the five traditional elements of earth, fire, water, air and lightning. Of course, since they are ninjas, they fight with weapons like shuriken and kunai as well as hand-to-hand combat. As expected of this kind of world, there's evil people, having different goals and reasons behind their evil.
The story follows Naruto, one of these ninjas, as he grow as a ninja, from being a stupid little prank-playing brat to becoming a fine ninja. Along the way, he interacts with and makes friends with many fellow ninja, fighting his way towards his dream of becoming Hokage (the leader of his village). 
The story isn't nearly as good as the concept would indicate. Sure, a lot of the characters has some nice background stories, won't complain about that, but they manage to drag out everything so much. It really annoys me. Some fights take several episodes when they could've been done them just as good in one or two. There's also way too much fighting. The story goes like fight, fight, background story, fight, fight, even more fight, half an episode's worth of resting or journeying, fight, fight, and so on. I mean, it's cool to watch fights, but there are just way too many fights, and they drag most of them out to unnecessary lengths. The only really enjoyable fight was the one between Sasuke and Naruto right before the fillers began. Which brings up another thing...
Fillers! Agh, I normally don't mind fillers, but Naruto had some really, really stupid ones. Sure, there was the occasional diamond among the charcoal, but that doesn't excuse the high amount of bad fillers. I mean, just because they are fillers doesn't mean that they have to make them bad. Several shows have actually made decent and at the same time long fillers (especially Bleach, with its 40-episode long Bount arc), but Naruto failed horribly here. 
Also, I feel that Naruto is very silly at times. Silly is usually good, but not when it's immature silly. And guess what+ Naruto is silly in an immature way. It's so dreadfully stupid at times that I had to close my eyes, take a deep breath and wait until it got serious again. Now, it did have some good comical moments, but those were far and wide between.
Another thing I feel like releasing my rage on is the animation. It barely manages to get the description &ldquo;average&rdquo; to me. At its best, it's slightly above average. However, a lot of time it's slipshod galore with the animation. I still have many very bad memories from having to watch lots of errors in the animation, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get rid of those memories. While the amount of errors decreased as the episodes passed by, at least every second episode before the 100s had one or more moments of slipshod animation. Wonder if they ever considered firing the animators.
As a side mention, they should do something about Rock Lee - even though I've slightly gotten used to his horrible looks, I still feel a burn in the back of my eye every time I see him.
The music is pretty good, though. A lot of great tunes (especially the sad ones are great), and the first few OPs and EDs were pretty awesome. It has some really bad music parts too, like the tribal voice-ish song, and sometimes they could've used better themes during the fights. As the series progressed, the quality of the OPs and EDs decrease too.
The characters are fairly okay, I guess. Some of them are really annoying, like Naruto, because he's so stupid. Agh, he annoys me to no end! Some other characters are annoying too, because of things like their looks (Gai and Lee), or because they are failed attempts at comical relief (at least in my eyes, you might find them funny), like the all too perverted Jiraiya.
That's the negative about them. However, they have some really nice background stories, some which are elaborated more upon than others. Many of the characters also get fair amounts of screen time, which for some people can seem too much, whilst others will be content with it, because their favorite character from the show gets an episode for him/herself. 
I also like the fact that most of them have dreams or aspirations, and motives for what they are doing and how they are acting (usually it's tied together with their background stories). The growing relationships between them is also nice, their maturing, and how Naruto is slowly getting accepted by more and more people through hard work. 
Basically, they've portrayed the characters very well, and not too over the top, but some of them act stupid and silly from time to time, which drags the character rating down.
I have some mixed feelings for the show, which kind of drags down on the enjoyability factor of it. Great concept, not as good story, both good and bad music, horrid animation at times, many characters with background stories, some of them great and some not-so-great; it's hard to completely make up my mind, but I believe the ratings I have given shows my feelings towards the different aspects of the show.
Of course, even though there was things I didn't like, I can easily see why this show is so popular as it is; it has humor that the kids may find funny, as well as  lots of fights which appeal to the teenagers and adults. I personally didn't like it that much, though. I'm looking forward to Shippuden, because I&rsquo;ve heard it was much better&hellip; I really hope so!

                I began to browse through the reviews of Naruto, and realized something was horribly wrong. All the experienced anime watchers were giving it crappy reviews, and all the first-timers were giving it rave reviews, with reasons that every anime has to back them up. How could this be? Gee, I wonder. For some strange reason, Naruto has become the most popular and well-known anime series ever, and as such, it is usually the first anime seen by anime watchers alike. Why this is, I don't know. Maybe it appeals to a wide variety of young teenagers...
When I was 13 years old, I remember watching and
                  loving this anime. I had never seen any other anime shows, and I thought the concept was original and amazing. When I found out that others animes literally had all that Naruto had plus a lot more, I was... bored with all the fillers. At the time the anime was great, but it really does get old.
Then again, the anime is not absolutely horrible. It has the essentials, with a somewhat unique story and art style. The characters are cliche, and enjoyment is there but short and sweet.
What I truly love about Naruto is the great soundtrack. It seems that all the OP and ED are just fabulous, and the music just fits within the series. I would have liked a bit of a change over the course of the show, but hey, it almost never happens.
All in all, it was a good show. Just good. So basically: Shame on those people who watch 10 episodes and immediately come here and write a review. Also shame on people who give this show all 1's because everyone else loves it. It's OK, but ive definitely seen better.",7

                Naruto, yes Naruto. One of the series that has defined the cultural shonen’s of the last generation in the history of anime. This is a series that has changed significantly over the past decade.
What I love bout naruto  is the whole “Ninja aspect” of the show. Every technique had substance, quality and all of the training arcs really shown the defining elements of how ninjutsu worked within the naruto universe. These qualities are something I will soon not forget. I know alot of people complain about naruto being a half ass wit that can’t do nothing Or perhaps sakura being useless. But in away
                  I look at the series as being a little different, especially in the developing of characters.
Kishimoto did not intend to create the story with a “bad ass” character right from the start, toppling villains one after the other, no. Naruto was set up in a way that much resembles an ordinary life and the tribulations and tests you must go through. Death is at every corner and naruto is a kid that is trying to fit in with the rest of the shinobi and be ""recognized"" I think that was one of the main defining elements of the original series. Kishi wanted to show here is a character that no one likes because he has a living breathing monster inside of him. You can only wonder what he is thinking, being in his predicament.
Watching him grow up as a monster and trying to be known as a famous shinobi and protect his friends, but realizing that he is in a world fraught with danger at every corner. Watching his friends die before him or getting hurt. The degree of emotion in the series was something I really enjoyed. It was really powerful. I remember hearing people spout nonsense in the discussions boards ""omg to much drama, get on with the fighting already"" But I actually liked how naruto had that drama, it fit in with the entire theme of the series. It kind of brings a whole different realism to the show compared to other shonen series. I won’t state any names.
One of the things that kishi really focused on in the original was friendship, and bonds. Thats one of the major theme's watching this team 7 grow up together, learning from kakashi and becoming great ninja in the process, learning the ways of the ninja world. This show explores themes of revenge, hate, bonds and sorrow to a very astounding degree.
  The characters in this series were in every sense of the word children, growing up in a world full of adults that were much more talented ninja's both skills and combat. That is not to say the show was made for children. Just that kishi wanted to show the younger generation as the main characters of the show and the older generation as the training shinobi. They had to learn the ropes of what being a ninja is like. After their pre training sessions, they were finally put to the test of just how grueling the world is and how they must use every ounce of there being to survive and also protect the people they love.
10 years ago people viewed naruto very different to how people view it today.
Perhaps maybe the reason I love naruto so much and the reason it feels very nostalgic to me, is because I was around when I watched it first aired and I remember the fanbase during that time of the original series. It was one of THEE most popular anime series on the net and not a single person had anything remotely unscrupulous to say about it. Suddenly after the 100 episode filler arc, or the not so appreciated “shipuuden” it lost its reputation and became a show just muddled by idiots that call any one narutards for watching it. I have seen how the fanbase has changed significantly over the past 10 years of watching naruto. It is quite sad really.
I still consider naruto to be one of my favorite quality anime series, regardless of where it’s going. Perhaps maybe its because im very infatuated with ninja's and like the unique way that kishi has created this ninja world. Similar to how i really love pirates in the one piece world. Every arc is something new and fresh so kishi can develop on that and expand upon the show in various different ways.  One piece had some of the greatest character back stories and cast I’ve seen in a series, but it did suffer from story progression a bit thankfully naruto does not. It has a pretty solid pace and some of the most ground breaking plot twists.
I guess it’s all a matter of personal preference and what you like to see in a show. I my self im not a huge fan of typical shonene tropes that are used consistently, but i love how the original series gave us a much more powerful emotional impact to the show. In away it felt more humanized as apposed to the more generic super power elements of shipuuden.",10

                I'm sure most, if not all, the people who end up reading this review have seen Naruto before and those who haven't are probably put off by the pure unadulterated hatred this and the more recent Shippuuden garner. Okay, I guess ""unadulterated"" is a strong word but I digress..
In any case, before starting this review I want to point out that I haven't read the manga so I'm unsure as to what was or wasn't changed during the process of animating this story and I guess it's time to get the show on the road. 
*Also, let it be known that the infamous ""Filler Arc""
                  is not part of this review.
Naruto is the story of a group of rookie ninja from Konoha (Leaf) Village, with particular focus on our title character Naruto Uzumaki and his two friends Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha. The story starts soon after the three of them graduate from there Ninja Academy and are put under the care of Kakashi Hatake who, for the most part, takes on the standard role of the ""mentor"" who teaches them the value of teamwork and all that jazz.
The main characters can apparently be hit or miss, though I liked them for the most part. Naruto himself seems to follow in the footsteps of Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise, though I personally don't consider him anywhere near as dense and also don't consider him an ""idiot"" like most people tend to.
Sakura seems to get the most flack from my experience because, for the most part she plays the ""useless female"" role. The thing is, she herself realizes that and actively tries to change herself which makes for some interesting scenes down the road. 
Sasuke is probably the most intriguing of the main characters, simply because he himself admits that he is only training to ""kill a certain man"" and he and Naruto clash quite a few times over their belief systems, particularly in the oh so excellent final arc.
As far as Kakashi, there isn't a whole lot to say as he reveals very few nuggets of information about himself. He's a cool guy, but he's very much a supporting character during this series.
But, to be honest, the thing that Naruto can be proud of is the excellent cast of supporting characters. From the intelligent, yet lethargic Shikamaru to the Bruce Lee wanna be Rock Lee it's pretty cool to see all these different characters, who usually have a very interesting and unique fighting style, clash with one another. 
It also should be mentioned that a certain villain, Orochimaru, who appears rather frequently is a scene stealer and takes part in some of the more memorable moments of this series. It's also when he appears that the show really takes off and gets interesting, as he is the instigator of some of the biggest plot points. His personality and his willingness to use any and all means to further himself and his power is interesting and very often disturbing.
One thing that is important throughout the series is the running theme of revenge and human relations. Every one, from Gaara to Sasuke to Naruto himself has had some sort of bad experience during their childhood and it seems as though ""friendship overcoming tragedy"" is maybe the predominate theme throughout the show.  
Now this series being a shounen, it's obvious it has pacing flaws here and there. For example, many of the fight scenes are dragged out to an annoying degree. And this is very apparent in the first arc when the characters go through two separate fight scenes that both take at the very least three or four episodes each, which isn't a huge problem if you marathon the series like I did. But, it still deserves  mentioning as it is annoying.
The plus side is that most fight scenes, particularly during the Chuunin Exam arc and beyond, are very well animated and just overall well done. The aforementioned Shikamaru for example has some of the more noteworthy scenes because he uses his head, instead of any physical abilities, and his fight scenes are always damn good fun.
But, this also highlights one of the issues I do have with the fight scenes and, even though this is a problem with shounen action anime in general, it's especially bothersome here. The characters have a habit of explaining everything they do to their enemy which would be time better spent actually defeating your opponent rather than telling them your skills. I know it's just so the mangaka can flex his thought process and the logic behind the attacks to the viewer but..it's still kind of tiresome and could certainly be implemented better.
I think the music bears mentioning as I thought it was either great, such as most of the music used during the dramatic scenes and some battle scenes, or forgettable, which is pretty much the rest of the fight scene music. 
The Japanese voice actors did a great job imo, especially during some of the more serious scenes. But, I especially got to shout out to the multiple voices for Orochimaru. Of which almost all of them are suitably creepy and, even though they sound different, they still manage to pull off the basic speech patterns. 
In Summary:
Story: 7
It takes a while for things to really get going, but once it does you'll notice it. Unfortunately for some, the pacing can sometimes be broken by the short training arcs which are actually pretty entertaining and in many cases are segued in nicely with the story arcs. Also, there is only one short filler arc throughout the first 135 episodes.
Art: 8
First off, it should be apparent from our protagonists conspicuous appearance that, in many ways these guys are ninjas in name only. Still, the appearances of the characters throughout the series are so varied that I, at the very least, didn't care. Animation does take a dip occasionally, however.
Sound: 8
Orochimaru is a plus, no doubt about that. And most of the other cast members have good voice acting, though Rock Lee's can sometimes be grating.. The music is pretty good, though occasionally generic.
Character: 8
Depending on how you take to Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura this could be your favorite part of the series, which is the case for me, or your least favorite, and probably game breaking, aspect of the series as it does depend upon these three for the vast majority of the story . But, I'm sure most people will like the supporting characters as almost all of them are developed to a satisfying degree. Unfortunately, all of them fit the tragic past stereotype so...your mileage may vary. You may want to avoid this series if you aren't a fan of melodrama.
Enjoyment: 9
Hell yeah, I enjoyed this series. I won't lie, I loved this series. But, it certainly isn't for everyone and I can understand quite a few people being frustrated by this shows some times slow, often times fast pacing and some of the more dragged out arcs even frustrated me at times. Also, as I said before, enjoyment largely hinges on whether or not you take to the three main characters or not. 
Overall: 8
 To sum it up, don't go into Naruto expecting to see the tightest script ever written or anything thought provoking. Just go into it for a fun time and, maybe, you'll be surprised by the well developed characters like I was. Make no mistake, Naruto was a great experience for me..especially because I went into the series expecting it to be terrible and, by the time I realized it wasn't, I was enjoying the ride. 
*If you want to make any sort of comment, just drop by my profile. Criticism is welcome as this is my first review in quite a while and I went with a different style than I have in the past. Thanks for reading this review, I hope it helps anyone interested in this series.",8
"
                	I would like to start this review off by saying that I did not grow up with the Naruto series, nor did I have any pre-judgment of the series before I started watching it. Therefore I’d like to assert that my perspective on this series is as unbiased as it’s probably going to get, considering its popularity. When watching the series, the first thing I did was compile a list of filler episodes, and then promptly skipped all of them. This is so my watching experience in terms of the story deviated from the manga source material as little as possible. That being said, here
                  is a breakdown of the score I gave the Naruto anime as well as reasons behind each scoring. As I typically do when reviewing anything, I will start off with the positives and end on the negatives.
Sound: 7/10
The sound in Naruto is definitely above average, and certainly immerses you in the scenes at hand. That being said, while the sound is a step above average, it isn’t top tier quality, so I feel as if a seven out of ten is properly justified. No need to really go into much detail here. 
Art: 6/10
I found the art in this series to be pleasing to the eye; there weren’t any moe blobs, characters that looked like they could sooner pass for aliens rather than human beings, and it lacked a “childish” sort of look to it. That being said, there wasn’t anything here that was spectacular. Considering it was produced from 2002-2007, there were series with much better art than this even before that time.  This is the justification behind me giving it the 6/10 that I think it deserves, which in my mind is just about average. 
Story: 3/10
This is where, for me, the Naruto series started failing. Anything mentioned here will be re-iterated in the very first episode of the series, so I’m assuming that this won’t be considered “spoilers” per say. Naruto is based off an infant child who is infused with the spiritual energy of a nine-tailed demon in order to prevent a disaster from befalling his village. He is now viewed as an outcast and a monster throughout his childhood because of these events, rather than a scapegoat for saving the entirety of his village. Now Naruto’s aim is to change this reputation, and gain the respect of his village by becoming the most powerful person in it. You might be thinking to yourself at this point, “Wow, that story isn’t bad at all, why are you giving this a 3/10?!”… Well, I will now explain my rating of this as concisely as possible. The issue here is that the story doesn’t evolve at all during the span of the 131 episodes that aren’t comprised of filler material. Naruto begins to be accepted by his peers early on, and the whole idea of him being viewed as a “monster” diminishes quickly. When that happens, Naruto wants to become the strongest just for the sake of being the strongest. This sets the stage for the story to carry out like practically every other shounen in existence, and what was once a unique story with a high potential for excellence loses said potency very fast.  I see no reason why to consider this story anything even close to mediocrity, hence the three out of ten rating you see here. 
Characters: 2/10
This is where I’ve seen other people say the series suffers the most, and after watching it, I’d have to agree with them. The phrase “one dimensional characters” gets thrown around a lot, and while I might have a different idea than some about the interpretation of this phrase, I agree with it. The thing with the Naruto anime is that the author only knows how to write one type of character type well, and that is the character that involves some kind of tragic loss in their life. I guess you could simplify what I just wrote and say “the only character the author knows how to write is Naruto” and get away with it just fine. Literally every character in the plot that is riddled with some sort of tragedy happens to have the same tragedy; someone they cared about has died in the past, and it has left them broken, mentally damaged or downright evil as a result. Don’t expect any sort character depth beyond this. The villains? They’re mostly evil just for the sake of being evil, or for the other aforementioned reason. They have that cliché plot convenience of “I’m not the true mastermind behind all the said evil events you have been fighting against, merely a puppet of some greater evil!” sort of deal, and spoiler alert, it doesn’t get old as the show progresses. That’s just the beginning of why I consider this anime to have one of the worst characterizations I have ever seen. 
Moving on to something else; romance. In my opinion, a romance should either be included and done properly, or given the setting, not included at all. With Naruto, I’m leaning more towards “not included at all”. Think of it this way, the characters are roughly the age of your average elementary school student. When you were about 11 years of age, were you concerned about having a girlfriend? I sure as hell wasn’t, I was more concerned about finishing my collection of Zelda games and beating my friends in Super Smash Bros. Yet romance plays a part of the primary characterization of some of the main characters, despite their age, and it really isn’t done well. You won’t see any sort of romantic development throughout the entirety of this anime, and given that a certain character’s (that shall not be named) “character” depends almost entirely on this aspect, it makes for a very poor attempt at convincing the viewer that they have any sort of significance in the plot. For these reasons, I give the characters a 2/10, being one of the worst attempts at characterization I have seen in modern anime. 
Enjoyment: 2/10
As a result of the other scores that you see above, this is what I came up with as a score. Given that I get most of my enjoyment from characterization and story, this score seems fairly natural to hand out.
Overall: 4/10
This is just an average of the scores you see above. This show is scoring consistently above 7/10 in reviews, and I see no merits behind why it should be, given what I have discussed above. I would conclude that with this score Naruto has too many flaws to make it a passable watching experience.",4
"
                I've heard a lot of people call this the most overrated anime of all time.
So is it really?
Well, that depends on who you ask. Me? I'm one of the guys who loves it. This is the anime that got me into anime in the first place. So why should you read my review as opposed to the hundred others? Because I'll try to show you both what everyone gripes about and what they love about the show. Bear with me on this review, as it will be a little long, but since the anime I'm reviewing is pretty long, I have a lot to cover.
Story
                  (10/10) - Ok, a lot of people gripe about the story of Naruto, saying it's cliche, moves too slowly, isn't interesting, or whatever. I have to admit, some of these complaints are well-founded. So why did I give it a 10/10? Because the story is so complex and well-done. A lot of this won't become obvious until Naruto: Shippudden, but this is a review of the original series, so, I digress.
Naruto is set in a fictional universe where Shinobi (Ninja) are basically the entire cast. Most Shinobi aren't mercenaries, but instead, fight to protect their village, and complete missions to earn money for it. The main character is one such Shinobi, name ""Naruto"" (hence, the name of the series). Naruto is a rebellious, disrespectful, punk, yet he still wants to become a great ninja. He even aspires to become ""Hokage"" (the lead ninja of his village). While this may sound pretty cliche, you'll quickly realize that Naruto has a long way to go before he has any hope of becoming Hokage.
This series goes through a lot of twists and turns. The story is too complicated to try to explain in this review, but the further along you go, you'll find that Naruto aspirations aren't easy to live up to. In the very first arc, Naruto and his companions are confronted by a powerful Shinobi who wants to kill the man they have been assigned to protect. The battle that ensued is what got me hooked on this show.
The fights in general are nothing short of brilliant. If you like action, this anime is for you! The battles will have you on the edge of your seat, and you won't be able to stop until you see how the fight is concluded. I also enjoy watching the characters learn new moves and apply them in combat situations. You'll see Naruto change from an annoying little punk, to a ninja who people actually start to respect for his perseverance and strength.
Now, for the things people gripe about in this show. Oftentimes, a fight scene will be interrupted by a flashback or monologue, and this can get dull at times. I didn't mind so much the first time around, but it does hurt the rewatch value a bit. The story can move slowly at times, but most of the slowness is because of how complex the story truly is. The further you go, the deeper you'll see things get.
Another thing people gripe about is the length. While it's true that 220 episodes is quite an undertaking, it's really not necessary to watch more than the first 135 episodes. Yes, you heard me correctly friends. The last 85 episodes of the show are nothing but a desolate wasteland, inhabited by nothing but the pile of vomit known as ""filler"". I only watched the first 40 episodes of filler before I'd had enough, and skipped on to Shippudden. Some of the filler arcs are truly terrible. You'll sit back and wonder how the creators of the show had the audacity to slap the name ""Naruto"" to the garbage you've been viewing (if you're brave enough to bother watching it). Hence, my review only covers the non-filler portions of the show. Do yourself a favor and skip the filler. It really isn't worth your time.
Art (7/10) - Here the show isn't as strong. While the art is never distinctly poor, it's also not great either. I suppose at times it can't be helped when making a series as long as this one. The animation is often stepped up for fights, or more intense parts of the show, which does help considerably. The art is at least passable, and I was never really bothered by it. Definitely not a show you watch for the eye-popping scenery, though.
Sound (7/10) - I must say that I really did enjoy the music at first. While it tended to use synthesizers a bit more than I cared for, it still distinctly fit the mood of the show. Some of the battle music was catchy, and managed to combine electric guitar with more traditional sounding string or wind instruments. However, the creators of the show didn't seem to think it was necessary to update their musical score once in awhile. This wouldn't have been a problem if the show wasn't 220 episodes long. Music that I had once enjoyed, began to grow a bit overused by the end of the series. It never grew to the point of bothering me, but had the show gone on much longer before the filler started, I might have thought differently. The music is good, just used for a few too many episodes.
The voice acting was easily good enough for me as well. Not outstanding, but never distinctly bad either. Just don't watch the dubbed version. Naruto's voice alone will be enough to drive you insane. 
Character (9/10) - Getting to know the cast can be a bit daunting at first. I've never taken the time to count, but there must be at least 30+ characters who get a decent amount of screen time in this show. While this sounds very cumbersome, it actually helps the show quite a bit. each character has their own unique back story and their own battle techniques. While one might think that ninja from a particular village all use the same techniques, this couldn't be further from the truth. The styles of combat are so diverse, that it makes for some VERY interesting fight sequences. Sometimes one character is at a distinct disadvantage, and is forced to out think his opponent in order to win. If it weren't for the brilliantly done fights and interesting characters, this show would lose a lot of it's value.
There is one drawback to all of these characters, though. Sometimes, a somewhat minor character will have a flashback in the middle of a fight. It does help to have some context for why they fight, but it gets old at times, especially if it's a minor character that no one really cares about. Despite this problem, the show does a good job of somehow making you hate a character in the beginning, and totally changing your opinion of them at one point or another. I can think of several examples of this.
Another problem is that some of the main characters (aka Naruto) are kind of annoying. Naruto is honestly a complete moron in the beginning, and you probably won't like him much at first. He gets better as things go along, but you'll still cringe at him a few times early on. Another annoying character is the lead female: Sakura. Sakura spends the entire series being obsessed with Sasuke (the third member of Naruto and Sakura's three-man team) and never really does anything worthwhile. She spends her time sitting on the sidelines of fights and cheering for Naruto and Sasuke (she gets better in Shippudden, but once again, this isn't a Shippudden review). While this didn't bother me at first, it got kind of annoying when all Sakura could do for the entire series was yell ""Sasuke, Sasuke!"" But anyway, moving right along. Their sensei,  Kakashi, is very calm and cool, and helps to balance out this team of knuckleheads. Naruto's an idiot, Sakura's useless, and Sasuke's a child prodigy, yet somehow, Kakashi turns them into a functional ninja team. An impressive feat, if you ask me.
To sum it up, whatever shortcomings these characters have, you'll still find yourself rooting for them as they are put through fight after fight, trying to protect their village, the people they love, and what they believe in. For every character that annoys you, there will be at least one that you genuinely love. Even though I did a lot of complaining about the three central characters, I still found myself rather attached to them by the end of the series. The characters will do a good job of making you laugh throughout the series, and it helps to lighten the mood when you sometimes least expect it.
As you can see based on the 9/10 I gave the characters, I definitely grew to like them. Despite all the complaints people have, the characters are still very well done.
Enjoyment (10/10) - It's hard to be objective on this part of the review. I enjoyed it tremendously, but there are plenty of people who don't. I'd say give it a chance and see what you think. You'll probably know whether or not you'll like the show after the first arc is finished, which is about 17 episodes.
Overall (10/10)- Were we on a slightly more precise scale, I might give it a 9.5. I've already said that I enjoyed it a lot, but let me try to sum things up for you:
Pros: Lots of action! There are a lot of very well-done fights, which is one of the strongest points of the show. The characters are a good bit better than average, with a few annoying exceptions. The story is long, and complex, but very good.
Cons: It's a long anime. 135 episodes (non-filler) for just the original series is a sizable undertaking. Some of the main characters are a bit on the annoying side, and it takes a few episodes before they grow up a little. The long filler arc at the end also turns people off, especially those who feel compelled to watch an entire anime without skipping the filler. 
Hopefully this helps!

                ok so I've seen like 200+ series and i have to say that this is one pathetic series. i watched up to shippuden 50. im telling you nothing interesting happens, and like 90% of the series is filler anyway. 
the plot is seriously lacking and its a pathetic excuse for a slice of life/action-drama type of show. im writing this for people who legitimately haven't seen the show but the series is just NOT worth the acclaim or watching at all. 
the characters are even worse. you have your over-zealous,untalented guy who thinks he can do anything if he tries hard enough. . .and he
                  just so happens to get increasingly stronger enemies to fight along the way. than you have your emo broody guy who all the fan girls swoon over while he talks about how much he resents his brother and must AVENGE HIS CLAN! get over it already and last you have your naturally talented good girl who has a crush on the bad boy, even though its obvious he hates her and that the other guy would kill to have her. look people this has been done MILLIONS! of times before so please if you haven't seen the series don't watch it. it will waste days of your life away for nothing. . .literally the series will take up 88 hours of your life! thats over 3 and a half DAYS! you could have been doing something WAY more productive. hell, it doesn't even have to be productive. you could probably have a better time watching paint dry! listen to me people, for gods sake i only watched as far as i did out of obligation to finish a series i started but it wasn't worth it! so PLEASE heed my words and never ever watch this series of overrated garbage!",1

                Proof that I will watch just about anything, or rather that I once had nothing better to do than watch this crap while waiting for Squidbillies to come on (Unknown Hinson fangirl).
In either case, there are few anime out there that evoke a visceral reaction like Naruto. Sure there is Inuyasha and you can get your eyes clawed out by yaoi fangirls for calling them closet lesbians, but no other anime has started a craze of shut ins wearing orange sweatsuits and headbands to school like Naruto. 
See, a uniform code is not just for keeping Crips and Bloods from wearing gang colors to school.
Naruto
                  is about a Ninja named Eddie. No, he's named Naruto. He lives in a village where some great Ninja master gave his life to entrap an alien parasite into a carrier queen, I mean a Demon Fox into a baby's body. That baby is Naruto, a completely useless ninja who can summon the great power of the fox within. Think of him like a impish Goku, or maybe Ichigo--I don't know. Anime that go on forever all blend in for me.
What is this all about, well it's the typical drawn out storyboard of characters growing up and becoming ninja. Doing Ninja missions (which are filler episodes) while the story dances around the plot that Sasuke is some talented Ninja with a traitor dick of a brother, some girl called Sakura, some short quiet Rei-clone of a girl whose name escapes me but I keep running into on gelbooru, and a sensei who loves kancho--but in the English dub the delightful Japanese pasttime of poking someone's asshole in a nonsexual way with your index finger is clearly unacceptable and heavily edited.
Honestly there is no plot. Naruto is a loser, but he has a great power and a lot of the show is geared around how he takes a beating but when he unleashes that power, it is maximum. There's some effeminate snake ninja who plots to get revenge on the leaf village, molests Sasuke, gets pwnt only to return over and over again, there's Sakura being split whether to spread her legs for Sasuke or Naruto--but settling for some old woman instead.
This is your typical cliffhanger anime where you watch someone power up or prepare to unleash an ultimate technique for 20 minutes, then are forced to watch a filler episode before you see the obvious, with plot twists usually being mundane like ""the ninja training exam has been hijacked, oh noes!"" With that said, you'd think with over 200 episodes they could develop the characters, but strangely these kind of anime seem to be unable to do that--instead of relying on stock characters that don't really change over time (well, they can become more moody, evil, or slutty--but that isn't a dramatic and shattering change).
I just have to concede that I don't understand this. And I also have to concede that I don't like this. Good drama and fiction doesn't spread itself so thin, becoming hopelessly lost in itself.
Also, for the love of God, don't dress up as Naruto.
Just don't.",3

                Having watched many different series of anime, I can understand why the &quot;elitest&quot; out there give this series a bad review; however, I can also say they're flat out wrong and biased. Naruto is a fantastic anime that doesn't get due credit where it's deserved.
First off, it's true that the fillers of this anime that take up about the last 1/3 of this Part 1 are flat out terrible. With the exception of the first two arcs (including the amazing Bikouchi retrieval arc) they're probably the worst anime I've ever seen and the fillers in Naruto Shippuden are just as bad. But I think as
                  anime watchers, we should recognize fillers when we see them and simply ignore them.
The anime itself is well-done with some of the most memorable tunes you will ever hear. I currently have one of the everyday tunes as my cellphone jingle - it's that catchy. The plot is original and fun, which is why Naruto has taken off to such enormous heights. The characters are all amazing and it's common knowledge that Kakashi and Itachi are two of the most bad-ass characters of all time in any anime. Everyone can find a character to relate to. From the lovable Rock Lee and Hinata to the inpalpable Gaara and Sasuke, we all find something to cheer for or hold onto in this anime, making it addicting.
 Those who give this anime a bad review refuse to acknowledge the points that make this one of the greatest and most popular anime of all time. It's their loss. Yu-Gi-Oh was the same way. You accept it or you don't, but if you don't like it, most people will disagree with you, which makes you wrong by consensus.
Try the first 15 episodes and give it an honest try. By the time the Kakashi/Zabuza fight rolls around, you might just get hooked. Don't say I didn't warn you.",9

                Naruto is a hit or miss show. You love it, or you hate it. I mean, how many times have you heard from Narutards calling it &quot;the best anime ever&quot;? How many times have you heard from Naruto haters calling it &quot;the worst anime ever&quot;? Both have ruined the Naruto fan base, so now no one pays attention to Naruto anymore. I hope this review will get at least one person to try Naruto, even if it turns out they don't like it.
The story is basically about the main protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki, and his journey on becoming the greatest ninja in the Hidden Leaf Village.
                  No one believes that Naruto can do this, seeing how this is because Naruto is a hooligan due to the loss of his parents at a young age, and how no one is friends with him because Naruto has a kyuubi, or demon fox, sealed inside of him that attacked the Hidden Leaf Village. Naruto isn't officially a ninja yet, so he takes the ninja test. He fails the test by his teacher, Iruka. Later, the other teacher in charge of the Ninja Academy, Mizuki, tells Naruto he can pass the test if he can get the ninja scroll, which is actually a scroll with every ninja jutsu known to man. Mizuki is actually taking the advantage of Naruto to take the scroll and destroy the Hidden Leaf Village. Iruka hears about this, and challenges Mizuki in combat, but is unable to win. Naruto then challenges Mizuki to combat after Iruka loses, even though Mizuki has the advantage, Naruto defeats Mizuki because he studied a technique in the scroll. Naruto is now able to not only clone himself with the jutsu, but able to clone about 100 of himself. Iruka then passes Naruto as a ninja, and is put in squads with Sakura Haruno, Sasuke Uchiha, and Kakashi Hatake, the team leader who is the second closest ninja in the whole series. After Naruto is put in squads, the series moves on to arcs, the Zabuza arc, the Chunin Exam arc (which basically every character in the Naruto series is introduced), the Orochimaru arc, the Jiraiya arc, and the Tsunade arc. All those arcs last up to episode 100. Even though Naruto has a basic story, each episode has it's own story to it, making each episode unique in it's own way. I therefore like Naruto's story because of this, which makes episode to episode enjoyable.
The art from Naruto isn't superb, but this probably because the anime was made in 2002. But this is an excuse, because the anime Fruits Basket was made a year before Naruto, and had superb art. The art looks basic, like One Piece and Bleach's art style. Naruto is a ninja anime, but if you couldn't tell already, none of the characters in Naruto look like ninjas. I mean, orange jumpsuits? Have you ever seen a ninja in an orange jumpsuit? Basically none of the characters wear black and cover their face with a mask, except for Kakashi, but that's his personal preference, not because the creator wanted one character to look like a ninja. Even though the art improved throughout the series, the animation still had plainness to it, so therefore I can't give the animation a great score.
The soundtrack that waws in Naruto was pretty good, and it fits in parts where it needed to be. A lot of people don't really enjoy the soundtrack, but I think the composers did a great job on the upbeat themes for combat and sad music for dramatic moments. And the voice acting was good for each character in both dubbed and subbed versions. Naruto has an arrogant whiny voice, Sakura has a self-sufficient bitchy voice, Sasuke has an assholish angry voice, and Kakashi has a leader-type of voice. I would go more on to voice acting of other characters, but there are too many characters to list.
Now on to the characters. There are a lot of good characters in Naruto, but some characters ruin great parts of the show. Naruto is a great main protagonist, who won't stop until he gets what he wants. Kakashi is a great leader, and always puts others before himself. Both Hinata and Neji Hyuuga are great characters for being strongly developed with the story line and courageous, and Tenten for being the closest of a ninja in the anime. Now some of the characters I don't really like. Sakura is bitchy and whiny, all she does is &quot;ADORE&quot; Sasuke, and is a useless ninja. Ino Yamanaka, because she is the most useless character in almost any anime, and Shikamaru Nara, for being boring. Therefore the characters I didn't like didn't necessarily ruin the series, but it sure didn't improve it.
I'm just going to say it, Naruto is one of my favorite animes, and almost my favorite anime series. Even though I didn't give everything a perfect score, there is one thing I can give a 10- enjoyment. I enjoyed almost every single bit of Naruto, all the way to episode 220. Naruto might not be perfect, but to me it was perfect enjoyment.",10

                Naruto, a lot of the new generations first favorite anime. It was not my first, I am with the last gen with Sailor Moon, DBZ and others. Naruto I started watching around... when it first came out. It was the first of it's kind, it lost spunk near the end, but it really kept you going for the first 135 episodes.
Story:
It was different then most animes, people don't admit it, but it was. It wasn't always about Naruto though, which sometimes made me wonder why Kishimoto called it Naruto. The story follows mainly Team 7 (Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura) and the journeys they have until
                  Sasuke starts to split, then it is about getting Sasuke back. The story is good, but reminds me of DBZ at times; too much talking, so the story takes a bit to be told. Despite that fact, the story still kept me interested until Sasuke finally left and then fillers. Those turned me off a bit, but I still finished it. (By the way, Shippuuden [Naruto part 2] is all about getting Sasuke back, if you didn't like that story, then don't bother watching Naruto Shippuuden)
Art:
A bit plan, but I liked how all the characters looked different. They all had different styles and designs to them. Rock Lee looked different from Orochimaru. Each character had distinct personalites to, but I'll get to that. The backgrounds were okay, but some looked great, like the Valley of The End where Naruto and Sasuke fought. I thought that was very interesting and symbolic.
Sound:
If you think of ninja music what do you think of? The music from Naruto. I think they really matched everything when it came to sound. The sound and music were the best bits from this show. Who ever this composer is, he made something out of himself because the show's music was much to its success as well as everything else.
Characters:
They are all different, I love that. Rock Lee has bushy eye brows, very positive and has simple eyes while Choji is huge, simple minded, and easily angered. Each character is different and that makes Naruto stand out to me. Some characters I didn't like, but every show has that. Naruto's character changes a lot and that bothered me through out this series, but overall, I still loved the characters.
Overall:
I loved this series, if you are going to watch it, watch until at least episode 135 and then, if you want, head to Shippuuden. I don't like Shippuuden very much, but if you gave Naruto all ten's, I highly recommend it.

                This has to be one of the worst anime series I've seen, and I've seen 240 anime series.  Now that's saying a lot.
Ok now on to some of the things that made it so bad.  First is the so called story that's supposed to take place I guess two hundred years ago.  Yet they have tv and radio, so when the heck is this anime supposed to take place.  Now as for the story which makes no lick of sense to me revolves around Naruto, Sakura,  and Sasuke on a journey to become the best ninjas.  Which wouldn't have
                  been so bad had the creators focused  on one type of anime instead of over blowing three of them from comedy, drama, action.  Just focus one one and have the other two has secondary.  Next lets move on to perhaps the worst part of the the show, the characters.  I'll focus on Naruto.  He is perhaps the most annoying main character I've seen in a anime series.  Every episode I watched, I wanted him to die more and more, I couldn't look past him in the show.  The other two main characters weren't nearly as bad as him, I might have given a little better score if they got rid of Naruto and focused on Sakura and Sasuke.  Ok moving on to the so called action.  First it's ridiculous, not very exciting, and drawn out through 2 to 3 episodes.  Finally there's the length of the so called series.  There's 240 episodes, plus another series, a few movies and some OVAs.  I truly believe the creators and the company that own Naruto are just milking pre-teen and young teenagers of their and their parents money.  Now don't get me wrong I know studios are trying to make money, but theirs a difference between making  money and ripping people off.
So please don't support this show anymore.",1

                Story: Naruto is a fairly decent anime that made quite a bit of mistakes, such as turning over half of the show into fillers, and taking the show into &quot;god&quot; level Dragon Ball Z style of fighting. Naruto starts out as a extremly good Ninja anime during its first season where everything you see is unexpected and the story is rather fresh and interesting, the first season including Zabuza had a perfect pace and the fight scenes felt truly of what ninjas should be.
   After the first season however we are left with a quickly declining anime, soon the fights becomes my &quot;special
                  move is better then yours&quot; and it doesnt really feel like its a ninja show anymore with everyone pretty much using random attacks, which essentially turns this show into another beat em up. After a couple of seasons they start to follow in the footsteps of Dragon Ball Z.
Art: The characters are well drawn, and the moves are flashy and nicely animated fight sequences.
Sound: While many of the music and songs of the anime are amazing, this show became plagued with... DATTEBAYO! ('Believe it' in english)
Character: A large array of characters with each a rather decent background, however because they wanted each character to have such a rich and fulfilling history, we became flooded with flashbacks. Also only a few characters truly stand out in terms of growth and development such as Gaara, Neji, Shikamaru and a few others.
Enjoyment:  I decided to rate the seasons individually and then average them, with Season 1 and 5 recieving highest marks.",5
"
                The mighty roar of a Kyubei vibrated throughout the area as a crowd of ninja from Konoha try their hardest to bring it to its knees. All the fighting is for naught until one person steps up and sacrifices himself to seal the Kyubei away. That man was known as the Fourth Hokage. Years later, a young orphan named Naruto causes much vandalism and trouble, just to get the attention he craves each day. His life goal is to become the next Hokage. Kishimoto Masashi has brought us a very long series of action, drama, and comedy about a young ninja in training known as Naruto.
                  This particular series focuses on the trials and tribulations of the young shounen who has only one life goal in mind: To become the greatest Hokage in Konoha village. Along with Naruto, he has a few friends who he has earned respect from. One such colleague is more of a mentor than a friend, and that certain person is Umino Iruka-sensei. Someone who was similar to Naruto when he was growing up, so he is the first person to understand what Naruto goes through. The next few are Uchiha Sasuke and Haruno Sakura, along with their sensei Hatake Kakashi. Now, onto the review of this long, magnificent-until-the-filler-starts series.  The animation of the show gets better by season, especially the opening sequence. The only qualm I have about the animation is the fighting sequences. More action, less stalemates, please. A stalemate is good now and then for a dramatic effect, but for nearly every fight starts to become tedious and boring. But I can work with it. It’s crisp and clear, and the designs of the scenery are refreshing because the structures of the villages are unique to their elemental area. Although the best designed character in my humble opinion has to be Temari and Shikamaru. Sure it is a bit of bias, but that’s only because those two are my favorite characters. Seriously, though. I like the thought of including a character such as Rock Lee to pay semi-homage to Bruce Lee. Although I don’t personally like the first opening song, it is a good theme for that season’s setting. The beat and rhythm of the song go well with the atmosphere, which is why it is a good pick by the Naruto crew. However I’ve listened to it too much and I don’t like it as much as when I had first heard it when I first started watching the show. I totally love the second opening song by my favorite J-Rock band Asian Kung-fu Generation. Again, it goes perfect with the atmosphere of the season and with the opening video animation. The third song is a good choice, however the singer is too high pitched to set the right mood of the song. It doesn’t mean I don’t like the song, though. I like it just fine. The singer is just too high pitched, is all. The rest of the songs are mostly J-Rock and their beats are very nice to follow. Fighting Dreamers, the fourth season opener is easy to sing along to, and that’s pretty nice. I won’t go into every single opener, so I’ll just move along to the actual soundtrack. The fighting music is good and gets you into the mood of the fight. Especially the fights Naruto participates in. That music theme is the most catchy that I have heard. But the most depressing fighting music is the theme that plays when the Hyuuga siblings duke it out in the Chuunin exams. It’s a touching match and the song really gets to you when you’re rooting for Hinata, or Neji, if you’re not fond of Hinata. Ah, the story. It is a magnificent story to follow a young ninja warrior’s adventures to becoming Hokage and fulfilling various missions with his group. The most compelling story is the Missing Nin arc featuring Haku and Zabuza. Ah, shounen-ai; Just kidding. These two had a really strong bond with one another except Zabuza didn’t realize it until it was too late. This arc is also the arc where we first see a glimpse of Kyubei Naruto in his first form. Although there isn’t much to say about the main story because the filler takes up most of the series. 135-215, Eesh. That’s a lot of filler. I do have to say that the first few seasons are worth purchasing, though not to purchase the fillers. Ah, the ever various and unique cast of Naruto. There is a character for everyone since the cast of Naruto is so vast; a character that eats a lot, to a lazy character who is a genius tactician. As I mentioned earlier, my favorite characters are Shikamaru and Temari, although Temari is from the Sand Village.  One could get a lot of value from this series; especially rewatch value as it is a very long series of 220 episodes. Well, less if you skip the filler, which is highly recommended you do if you rewatch the series, unless you find a filler arc you enjoy, then more power to you. I enjoyed this series, although to be honest I haven’t completed the 220 as of now, I still have 15 to watch to complete this 220 episode anime. That’s all for now.",7

                Naruto, who doesn't know about it? It's a wildly popular series that is controversial-- oh, almost every worldwide-known series is like that. First of all, i just don't get how people keep on complaining about this series. Like, those who gave this series a one-two-three ratings, i wonder what is wrong with them? They better came up with acceptable reasons. And oh-- maybe most of them thought that they're some sort of experts just because they've seen so many other animes besides this (even though they seriously can't make any better show-- note, MAKE-- than this show). I dislike those kinds of ppl that keeps
                  on complaining due to some unclear reasons. And i know that this review might get me hated somehow, but whatever. Here are my thoughts.
The story is your stereotypical shounen-ish, capturing a parallel Ninja world, where almost everybody is a ninja and they have some cool superpowers (that's what i call), and there's this weak and stupid main character that eventually grows along the story. To me, the story is a masterpiece. Like, this is one of the first ninja shows at that time, and it pretty much introduced to us how are ninjas like. The main plot itself is unbelievably good (to me, dunno how everyone else feels), a boy that holds some kind of massive power inside of him that remains hidden, but at some moments it will come out. And i also love the idea of making 1-tailed, 2-tailed until 9-tailed monsters, that really got me. Aaand also the awesome techniques and awesome creatures. Until this point, i like almost everything from the story. It quickly catches our attention and it easily makes everyone to sit back and enjoy the show. I watched this show for the first time when i was 10, and like all kids, i instantly got hooked. Indeed, it has some undeniable flaws, like its cliche and guessable story, and maybe some spots of gary stu, to say. But, isn't that all shounen series all about? How the main character who was nothing in the beginning, began to grow and finally becomes something? It was okay enough for me. The fights themselves were also fun and made me eager to watch, and it's even okay to watch it again and again. It's never boring and to me, the story never grows old. Well, Naruto is one of my childhood memories so i might sounded a little bit biased. But that is to me.
The characters are-- god, there were like tons of them. Besides the main characters there were absolutely lots of supporting characters that appeared just in some stories and later never showed up again. I absolutely love the way they designed the characters with their unique traits, and note that the design has lots of varieties and i was never bored to see some new characters appearing because they're not the same, they're different. I sometimes thought how could ppl design so many people (because in my case, it's so hard to draw even 10 different faces). Well, Kishimoto looked really professional on designing the characters. Lots of different types of hairstyles (from the normal one until the absurd one), clothes (this one is definitely amusing), and so on. The animation itself is pretty colorful to me, and fight scenes (which is the soul of this series) were drawn neatly. And the sound effects--- for god's sake, i love the BGMs!! There are dozens-- or maybe more-- of sound effects, background musics, and opening-ending song in this anime. 220 episodes is not a short one, and they definitely made it not boring with the music. I could note some songs that i really like coming from Naruto. Toshiro Masuda really, really gave me the thrills with his awesome BGMs whenever we're watching some scenes and then dramatic BGMs that absolutely fits the story begins to play. Music is one of the best aspects in this series, tho. I even downloaded some of them to escort me on doing things. Yeah right.
Naruto... is a really enjoyable series. Indeed, as i stated before, it's not perfect. No series are perfect. The best series ever known also came up with some minor flaws. And so is Naruto. Maybe you guys are irritated with the characters, or maybe the typical storyline, or maybe the absurd length of this series, you guys have your own opinions. I'm not a professional or whatsoever, i'm just an ordinary kid who enjoys watching animes. And these are my opinions.",10
"
                Naruto was the first anime I ever watched. And I'm glad it was. Because if I had watched for example Death Note, I think I wouldn't still be watching anime. Why is that? Naruto isn't a 'hardcore' anime. It is just plain fun and everyone can understand the storyline. While some other animes may be confusing when you first watch them, Naruto is just clear. 
Very soon I realised what the power of Naruto was. It isn't the story, which is quite cool too, but it are the characters! Everyone has their own story and their own way of thinking. Their own powers and their
                  own weaknesses. This isn't something new in an anime, but Naruto does it in such a great way! It is really touching when someone is about to die, and you feel really glad if one of the main characters won a battle. 
What too is a great thing, is the whole world. The town feels realistic, although it is in a fantasy world. What I mean is that everything just feels natural and right. All the ninja ranks and how people treat eachother, it feels like a real but different world. The enviroment is beautiful too and is perfect for the battles which will take place there. 
I have been very, very positive untill now. The negative aspect of Naruto is that there are a lot of fillers. Sometimes they are just plain fun, but I really got annoyed when I found out that the episodes 120 untill about 200 are all just fillers! I quit watching and started Naruto Shippuden without missing anything of the plot.
I would recommend this to anyone one who loves action-based animes. It is fun and probably one of the most ass-kicking animes!",9
"
                Wow... I look back and realize how painfully mediocre Naruto is compared to all the Anime I have watched recently... Its a shonen series, but it isnt really special... Just another addition to the &quot;boredom-inducing-fillertastic&quot; pile of anime in the end. It seems that many people have overrated this series because it was one of their first series, and they havent really watched many series anyways... -just a thought (All you hardcore fans keep reading, I explain myself)
Overall: Naruto had the setup to be something epic, though the length and the way they tell the story completely destroyed what chance they had at becoming epic.
                  They dragged out the story to include useless extra stuff, and though the characters had some depth, they kept trying to add more depth and not really adding much at all, just wasting time. The whole of Naruto is filled with episodes where you dont really get anywhere both in character development and story development, even the non-filler episodes did not do that well in developing the series in general. I admit, I liked watching Naruto at first, when I didnt really have much experience with much anime, now I look back and man does it look like crap compared to things like Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion or Tengen Toppan Gurren Lagann, or even Black Lagoon, I can understand why people that are fresh into anime are easily turned into &quot;Narutards&quot; now, just like the &quot;Pokemaniacs&quot; back in the day. This series is on a path that leads to a &quot;Inuyasha&quot; kind of standing.
Story: Kid wants to be mayor of ninja town, ok thats nice, but has he REALLY gotten much further to ACTUALLY becoming &quot;Hokage&quot; in the last 200+ eps of this roundabout story? fillers killed what little naruto had in story. The way they stretched the story to encompass EVERY LITTLE THING is its main flaw, little side stories are nice and everything, but if you overdo it, you are just adding a giant mass of fat to the bone, no meat. If they just made Naruto something like a 2 season shot or something less then 50 episodes, then there might have been an epic anime that is worthy of being in the group of truly great anime.
Art: meh... its not anywhere near as impressive as Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex with its 30million yen budget per episode, but it at least doesnt have any major flaws, though the art seems pretty bland sometimes, other times, the art is overly complex for what they are trying to show, but usually there isnt much of a problem in art.
Sound: i never really liked the kind of atmosphere that the background music made me feel, it wasnt epic, the background music didnt really fit the situations very well, for example the overpowering flute in most of the bmg and the apparent manly &quot;HUA!&quot; that is overused do not really set much of a mood, I understand that there is a theme towards more traditional Japanese type of music, but it doesnt work well in many cases, there are way too many times where it just wont set the mood right and they beat the crap out of the dead horse, its hard to explain very well, Im raising my score to a 5 because AKFG and Sambomaster sang openings for it and they worked well with the anime.
Character: There is a very large cast in Naruto, though its usually a bad thing, they made it work somewhat. Even though the characters are somewhat deep, they all consist of cliched stereotypical shonen characters and do not have much to set them apart from the giant mass of other shonen story characters, also nothing EVER changes in the personality of the main character, Naruto, though he is cheerful, optimistic and energetic, he never realizes the reality he lives in and due to a lot of dumb luck and his gift of insane power he passes all his trials and tribulations, he is so naive that it is painful to watch, he almost never has a mature or realistic look on things, EXCEPT FOR HIS FEUD WITH SASUKE, even then he still does not have a mature attitude in many situations. His development is like Arika in &quot;Mai-Otome&quot;, painfully naive, though he doesnt even advance as far as Arika in maturing, at least she somewhat matured throughout the story. There are good characters in the mix, for example, Shikamaru and Garaa are pretty well developed characters that have promise. However with all that said, Naruto kills EVERYTHING in character, its amazing how dumb he is sometimes, dumb to the point where he should get himself checked for mild autism, unfortunately he usually blocks out the possibility of good mature side characters with his obnoxiousness. I guess there was more then one reason people tended to stay away from Naruto, besides the fact he has a fire fox's spirit sealed within him.
Enjoyment: it was enjoyable when I started watching it and it stayed that way for about 100 episodes, then it just tanked... now I have no intention of taking this up again. The amount of entertainment is not enough to keep me interested, nothing like Detective Conan, which nearly only uses its entertainment value to keep me interested.",4

                    Hm... Naruto as a series is a difficult one to review. It's almost 'cool' and 'accepted' to say this mainstream anime is overhyped and cliche. If one were to gush about Naruto one would immediately jump to the conclusion that they are a child, naive, or just new to anime. 
   Naruto is a story about a orphan kid who becomes a ninja. If you look at Naruto's story objectively it's actually pretty good. It has all the stuff you would likely want in a story; rivalries, fighting, ninjas, friendship, philosophical moralizing etc... What ultimately makes this shounen different
                  from say a DBZ or a Bleach is that all these things are all woven better into the story making a better cohesive story. There aren't any real devastating plot twists that come from nowhere in Naruto. The most important things that happen are foreshadowed a good deal throughout. Each arc ultimately ties into the next unlike a DBZ and the degradation in story isnt as quick as a Bleach. The story is woven and complete (IMO) throughout the 100+ episodes.
   The characters in the show is another huge plus. Sure the titular character, Naruto, is irritating but the real strength here is the wealth of background characters in Naruto. Each of them through the series (manga related episodes) are given, for lack of better words, their time to shine. The themes related to each character also makes for interesting dialogue between them. Which brings me to dialogue which is another standout. The tone shifts quite abit through the 150ish episodes but the humor, dramatic scenes, or moralizing/psuedo-philosophical stuff all come off reasonably natural. 
   Next the music is reasonably good. It has a nice feel to the music and it fits the scene pretty well. The theme 'Sadness and Sorrow' is a nice piece but tends to be overplayed in the dramatic places. 
   By now you probably realized that I really liked Naruto, I watched it years ago but I still enjoy watching an episode here and there. I was a little discouraged when people my age were beginning to shut out Naruto for more 'edgier' animes. I dont think someone should put down Naruto because it's a kid show. Sure it's a little silly here and there but ultimately watching it makes a dam good time. I've watched a good share of animes but I have to say Naruto is still the most fun (doesn't mean its the best). Rejecting the things that were important in your youth seems almost natural but in this case it's unwarranted. Watch, enjoy. Rewatch, enjoy more.
**This is a review of the ep1- the last manga arc of Naruto disregarding the fillers and Shippuden (which I have not seen- more proof that I'm not just a fanboy... maybe) **",9
"
                First to say: I decided to write a review for one of my favorite animes even though there are more than enough reviews. My anime addiction is indebted to this series because this  was the one that invited me to the otaku world...
Story (7/10)
Naruto's story revolved around a obnoxious kid named Naruto, if you don't like him, then it's not very likely that you'll love the series. 
The plot is a bit shallow and a bit of a cliche; a stupid main character who wants to attempt the impossible and has a hidden power behind his sadness having stereotypical nakamas to protect. Simply to
                  say it is the journey of Naruto to become the best; however, he has to face conflicts within himself, with others and with the world as well.
Don't expect psychology, deep philosophy, and thought provoking issues here because Naruto was made for the general audience and tackles drama within the character's personal  lives as teenage ninjas, there are almost no societal issue here and war and politics are not a prominent figure. The story is about lives. The life of a ninja here is portrayed in a comedic and adventurous way in the eyes of mostly innocent youths who in time, will be able to learn about its darkness.
But what made Naruto so lovable? It is the universe it created. The villages, the clans and the people's lifestyle are so fun to learn about, they are so fun to be in. Plot twists are plentiful and the characters' interactions are very exciting. 
But the heart of Naruto fandom is the ACTION; loved characters fighting with their well loved skills. Each of them has unique attributes coming from their bloodline or they developed personally. Most of the time, they think while they fight resulting into exciting clashes of logic and tactics. Their powers also have 'scientific explanations' from the make-up science in this show giving room for countless forums and fan speculations where their strengths and weaknesses are discussed; example is ""who will win if...""
However, I was displeased with the development of the series; it started out really good but after episode 140 or so the anime was filled with useless fillers, totally useless and unenjoyable.They really ruined the show; It was a real disappointment to fans that the transition to Naruto Shippudden was a total disgrace.
Overall the story is very addictive and will keep you glued to the screen until the fillers came.
Art (7/10)
The character designs are very simple yet memorable, no character looked alike and each other and each has trademark outfits, which were not very detailed. Eyes, noses, mouths and hair are nothing special making Naruto characters one of the easiest to draw.I also loved the use of symbols, such as the Konoha leaf and Naruto's spiral, they leave a considerable amount of impression to viewers.
The houses, shops, fashion, and art in general in Naruto are both landlord era and modern anime style inspired.
Yet the animation was very inconsistent; there are times when faces are so ugly and the action scenes, which are excellent, are poorly drawn (especially at the fillers).
Sound (8/10)
What I can say about the music of Naruto is that it is appropriate. The music was heavily Japanese themed and gives you a ""ninja"" feel. Though not exceptional it is not disappointing; if the scene is sad, the music will make you even sadder, and when there is action, the music will pump up your adrenalin. The opening and ending themes are quite enjoyable and addictive, making them highly anticipated.
But the length of the series made the music overly used and lacking in variation.
Character(7/10)
This part is very debatable...It is also the part that made Naruto hated by many, the main characters and also some secondary characters) are cliches:
A boy who has a hidden power triggered if his nakama is in danger and wins over strong opponents by willpower
A rival who is smart with looks better than the main character, fan-girled too much and has some dark undertone.
A girl obsessed with the 'rival' who is liked by the unliked main character whom she constantly bullies
Mostly the characters are a bit shallow but they are worthy to be loved. Some of them are inspiring, some irritating, some cute, some has psychotic attributes and some are cool depending on a person's preference: a very good formula for a shonen anime. They are not mediocre and their role in the story is noteworthy as many of them develops significantly as the series progresses, whereas each has his or own internal or external conflict. 
Naruto promotes many important values such as friendship, family, hardwork and  maturity with its characters.I find it inspirational and heartwarming. I also loved its concept of having a ""home""and  to belong to and having a ""dream"" to work hard for. Overall the atmosphere is positive here.
HOWEVER, the fillers made room for too many cheap, sissy dramas and trying-hard-to-be-deep- characters who are very unnecessary. The plentiful unnecessary flashbacks also ruin some climatic parts and made the drama bland.
But Naruto isn't very shallow at all. One can see it's unforced efforts to bring symbolism; a character living in bloodshed was associated to the pureness of snow, the blooming of flower as a metaphor for growth, and the leaves of the village compared to the next generation or the progression of time.
Angst and sadness is plentiful here but they are viewed from the eyes of pre-teens and pre-teens are mostly shallow no matter how deep they think they are. But it doesn't mean that the drama is shallow, it was just portrayed naturally from the characters' point of view.
Naruto, though he is a typical shonen hero, has a different effect on people and has an amazing power to impact both the characters of the show and audiences alike. His development is superb: from a naughty, proud and idiotic outcast kid he strove hard to be recognized by following his way of a ninja to become an inspiration to everybody.
Enjoyment (9/10)
I loved it so much...I've been addicted to it for three years. Even though I watch new series, Naruto still remain in my top list. My experience in watching this is very different from other shonens, and conversing with fans alike will make you feel very welcomed in loving this series.I can extract endless fun information from the series and fansites. It is just that the fillers really ruined the mood...
Naruto is not exceptional in every aspect(except action and comedy perhaps) if you compare it to very artistically done animes but it may be the best in one thing: earning people with unconditonal fandom despite its weaknesses. Isn't it a very rare attribute?
""It's just popular but not really good."" Then why is it popular in the first place? It is because the majority loved it and don't care about its flaws. Naruto is very age-friendly and gender friendly, and a very well composed shonen.
So heed my final words: exposure to this material may cause long term addiction
OVERALL: 7/10",7
"
                I laughed, i cried and i was excited. In other words there were everything in this anime what necessary to a long anime like Naruto :) As i was watching it i didn't feel that it was waste i watched such a long anime. 
I liked Naruto's character so much. Naruto is a freaky, dumb and unlucky person who was always outcasted by the people in the village. However later he became a careful, strong guy who passes everyone's expection and surprise them. He's been helped by his friends and he's able to move forward by their assistance. He thinks Sasuke as a friend during
                  the whole time what they spend together in the Team 7 it's (maybe) because Sasuke is also lonely after he lost his parents. I've learnt a lot from this anime. 
The voice actors were great. Even though i was surprised that Takeuchi Junko is Naruto's voice still i think she is the best for Naruto. 
The opening and ending songs fitted to the anime very well. Especially the FLOW songs. I liked almost all of the soundtracks in it. 
I like its grafic. I suppose it's unique. 
To sum up i gave 9/10 to it.",9
"
                Naruto has to be the most over rated anime in existance. Every kid who has never seen anything else besides pokemon and dragon ball Z all give it rave reveiws, but all the experienced anime watchers know better. SOme people describe it as Dragon ball z with ninjas, i think that is quite and accurate description.
Story: 5
I gave this a five just because of the filler nightmare and lack of a functioning plot.
Art: 8
As much as i hate to admit it, the anime has really good art. But it has been put to waste by everything else.Sound: 5
Whats the word? Cliche action sounds.
Character: 3
The character is horrible, there just doesnt seem to be anybody that interesting in the anime. And alot of useless characters such as sakura.
Enjoyment: 3
It was torture but every sad i had to watch it.
Overall: 2
Worst anime ever.",2
"
                Naruto is a hit and miss with some people. You can hate or appreciate; that's how it works. Most people say that Naruto is a pretty bad anime, and in reality, it's not. While there are obvious shortcomings and issues, there are also some really good parts in this anime that probably anyone would enjoy.
Of course, what is Naruto, really? Well, it's a story about a boy named Uzumaki Naruto, whose dream is to become the Hokage, or, top ninja. This is an incredible feat, of course, and only some one extraordinary could achieve such a feat. However, he is different. Naruto's path is (and
                  will) be very difficult, since an incident many years ago left him with a demon, the Kyuubi, sealed inside his body. The Kyuubi is a beast with exceptional power that nearly destroyed the Village of Konohagure, Naruto's village. His village disgraces him for his powers not because of the boy himself, but out of fear that the power will return one day. Naruto wants to prove the villagers wrong and become Hokage, and protect them. He will, of course, need special training in order to become so, and also the necessary training that all ninja trainees get in order to succeed. Will he? You will just have to watch.
Now, what do I think about Naruto? Well, being a USA resident, I was first subjected to the dubbed version all those years ago. I had read The Shonen Jump pilot manga years ago, and with technology not being as advanced as now, watching subbed episodes without importing and learning Japanese was impossible, so I was subjected to watching the dubbed episodes. Of course, being a longtime anime fan, I was not impressed, compared to other anime's that I had watched prior (that were dubbed). My luck changed eventually, and subbing groups were formed and I had gotten what I wanted. The original, un-edited content and blood that the cut-dry dubbed version did not have. Alas, my opinion changed. I was left satisfied and it exceeded my expectations. 
Now, now. Naruto is not the greatest anime that I've ever seen. However, it does not suck. The character development goes at the speed you would expect it to, and Naruto does leave behind characters that you will remember (and ones that you will want to forget -- Sasuke, anyone?) The animation, amongst other things, is good, and battles in-depth (although it might take some time for the characters to move.. just to waste time, really). Now, the last part comes up to you. Naruto, like I said before, is a hit-or-miss. You either fall in love with the concept, or you hate it to the core. Personally, I don't. I like the ninja action and the plot development. You may not. That's the point - Naruto is what you make of it. It may be the best thing you ever see, or the worst. Now all you need to do is find out for yourself.",8

                Okay an honest review here truthfully this is one of my favorite anime, but there are things that i liked about the show and things that i hated about the anime. I enjoy the story, it starts of very simple but it gets deeper as you go on through the series, however it never explained why naruto dressed in orange. 
the art is amazing i love their style especially in the fighting scenes, i can see that they worked very hard on those scenes and i feel they did the anime some justice with they're art.
The OST and the sound effects were awesome, it matched
                  the Anime well, it made the fights more intense and also made a lot more scenes come to life.
The Character all came in at the right time in the first season the main characters it focused on was Naruto, Saskue, Sakura, and Kakashi. Naruto was the most explained character, to be honest he was a terrible ninja in this series and should have died. Saskue is a very skilled ninja on the other hand and everyone likes him. Sakura, i can simply say i grew to hate her, as the story goes on she just makes everything worse. Kakashi is a mystery the whole time, you learn very little about him in this series.
This anime is very enjoyable, but they are very repetitive with the flashbacks i don't mind flashbacks but if they keep repeating the same flashback that they showed a few episodes back it gets annoying, but the action keeps you in the show to be completely honest, the explanation of the abilities is also interesting some people hate it, but i like it, it's your opinion about that. also if you don't like filler after ep 135 go to 220 and skip the 1st half lol.
overall i give it an 8/10 i personally think this show isn't overated its just people want others to see it.",8
"
                Although Naruto is sometimes overexaggerated with the way it has somehow been &quot;stolen from other manga artists&quot; and it isn't creative. Naruto, although very simple character, has a great personality and proves that he is able to do anything so long as he sets his mind to it. With his friends and Konohagakure no Sato behind him, he sets his mind on becoming Hokage, the greatest ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village. That does not omit the fact that Naruto has other infamous characters that are loved.
Uchiha Sasuke - the character that every girl seems to love (besides myself. Naruto fangirl here), and the somewhat
                  antagonist of the story was meant to die at the beginning of the series. So far, he seems to always have a way of slipping through everyone's hands, and has a demeanor that just says to everyone he looks at, &quot;Back off.&quot;
Haruno Sakura - the girl that has a major crush on Sasuke, who Naruto has a crush on, and with the undeniable passion to do what she wishes. Although considered the weakest of the Konoha 9, Sakura has a knack for chakra control, and Inner Sakura seems to give her a bit of a teenage look about her. What girl doesn't have her own inner self that screams out what she wishes to say?
Hatake Kakashi - the man that leads the group. A jounin beyond his years, Kakashi helps Sasuke most of the time, but in the end realizes his mistake of not helping out Naruto at all. This leads to him wanting to keep everyone safe, so it helps a lot of people. 
I personally adore Naruto. It gives me an insight of what I could be if I were an anime character. That character would be Sakura, no doubt. In the end, though, Naruto does have its kinks to work out, but it will surely become a masterpiece that I wish for my children to look back on. Allowing something like this to be able to be published lets my life understand that it is a brilliant world in my imagination!",9
"
                Naruto (not Naruto Shippuden) is awesome. It had a nice setting, character development, plot, and fighting scenes. The thing I enjoyed most about Naruto was its character development. The diverse array of characters in Naruto all (with the exception of Ten-ten and a few other people) had their spotlight and unique identities. I especially liked Naruto because he was the hard-working underdog.
You also get these bad-ass fighting scenes. These fighting scenes, I felt, actually made sense. There weren't many nakama-power ups, and the good people didn't always win. Everyone was limited by chakra. You also get some cool strategies!
I really enjoyed this series. And even
                  though I don't continue Naruto with the manga or watch Shippuden, I still like to rewatch old Naruto episodes.",8
"
                As a big anime fan, i watched many different animes, maybe not as much as most people, but still enough to find what i liked and disliked, and Naruto is definately not in those choces of in between, it,s plain flat hatred, at first i was obsessed with the anime, and now i do NOT understand why... seriousely... it,s really disapointing, Naruto is the most viewed and probably the most loved shounen manga/animes ever....  i seriousely don't get why people are so hooked on it, it's clichéd and overused
Story: 1
A kid who's parents died (right there, cliché) when she was a baby (cliché) has
                  the dream to become the leader of his village (cliché) and has a crush on a girl (cloché) who hates him and likes another guy (cliché) who is way cooler (cliché), those three end up in the same team (cliché) with a teacher who wants to unite them better (cliché).... That's the basic story, alot of things happen obviousely, but i just can't find anything that really ATTRACTS me to the story well.. and i,m a huge fan of shounen, many of my friends don,t even believe i'm a girl because of that, so i have a pretty good eye to compare, and when i compare between this anime and another shorter/better story, i would definately pick another anime... the story is too long and too boring after a while, many of my friends stopped reading/watching it because it took too long, they simply don't care about the end anymore.
Art: 8
Art was pretty good, that was one thing i didn't hate about the anime, it's pretty basic and simple to draw, and it's also easier to imitate drawing characters like those, but i can't give the art a 10, because it was too simple, sure most people will tell me what the hell i'm talking about since art isn't what matters most, i know that, but i'm trying to look for reasons to not give this anime a 0, catch my drift?
Sound: 4
The sound was okay, but it was always the same tone... i just wished they had different sounds, and the allmighty overused HA noise... well it's in one song, but it apears everywhere...
Character: 1
the characters were UTTLERLY clichéd... hyper main character, cool second main character, lovesick mmain girl.... you see those almost everywhere....
Enjoyement: 1 (sadly there is no 0..)
Plain flat boring, plain flat clichéd, plain flat annoying and most of all, plain flat TOO F*CKING LONG i can't believe people are ACCTUALLY still into that anime! like seriousely? What is so awesome about it? oh no wait.. don't tell me.. cause i don't care...",1
"
                I forced my way though around 43 episodes before dropping this, so you can't tell me I don't know what I'm talking about. This has to be one the worst animes ever made. I'd recommend Mars of Destruction before this. Naruto seemed to have potential at a first go, oh maybe it's going somewhere! Then it doesn't. So much for the plot. The art, is decent. Not really good enough to wow me.  The sound was decent as well, but nothing worth talking about. The characters are awful, with no depth to them at all. If you are going to drop it for anything,
                  it's going to be the shallow characters. Overall I didn't enjoy this. Nor should anyone watch this anime, ever. Go watch something good, like FMA or GTO.",1
"
                NARUTARDS BEWARE
Let me start off by saying that I, like many others, watch this show immediately after very popular anime like Dragon ball z, Yu Yu Hakusho, Trigun, so I thought that this show was great, though some things always stuck out in my mind.
That being said, let me move on to this, Naruto TANKED, FAILED, SUCKED, WOMPED, AND ALL AROUND NOT GOOD after the Rock Lee vs Garra fight, (around ep 50 ish)although looking back it was not that great before that. 
Story:
Very mediocre, &quot;I want to be the ______ strongest and best ________ so that everyone will ________!!!!!!!!!!&quot; Seen it all before, he
                  wants people to notice him because he didn't have any friends and has a demon fox inside of him that he conveniently didn't began to use until the beginning of the series. Now I would like to digress to a few things that I notice, First Naruto claims that nobody talked/acknowledged him but then he is shown eating with Choji, sleeping with kiba, and running from the hokage? with Shikamaru when they were all younger, now I no expert but that sounds like friends to me. Second is on the first episode, a YOUNG, UNTRAINED NINJA WANNABE and a mediocre older ninja managed to steal a highly &quot;important&quot; scroll that teaches someone something that alot of people already know (shadow clone). anyway, the story suck because usually when someone says they are going to do something (especially when it's so close to there reach) they do it, Naruto it no closer to become Hokage than he was 200+ episodes ago. LOL I don't even need to talk about the fillers since its been killed and rekilled.
Art:
Everyone says its so great but has anyone else noticed that in at least 2 fights (team 7 vs girl Orochimaru and Sasuke vs Naruto) the animation changed drastically in the middle of the fight...........'nuf said.
Sound:
No real complaints other than, that music gets annoying after a while, I mean the HUH one, and some of the VA's are annoying.
Character:
Oh yes, now first SOME OF THE CHARACTERS DON'T HAVE PASTS!!!!!!!!!! yea I suppose people like Shino and Ten Ten had absolutely nothing of importance happen to them, and while on the subject of Ten Ten, the author of Naruto HIMSELF said the Ten Ten iss just a FILLER character, acting only to fill in the place of the female character in Guys team..........what type of crap is the a filler main character, also there are no character (outside of filler) interactions, I'd like to see Lee and Hinata have a conversation, I'd like to see Kiba and Neji chat it up. Naruto is just plan annoying his attitude changes to much, one minute he's destroying the villages monument and the next he's risking his life for one dude, and what's up with this I will get Sasuke back no matter what it so annoying, has he given up on being Hokage? The saving graces of the characters are Kakashi, Shikamaru, and a few others that they almost never show. One more thing the characters almost never change, Kiba has been the same( from what they've shown) since the beginning so has Sasuke, Sakura, Lee, ALL FEMALE CHARACTERS etc, etc
Enjoyment:
like I said, at first I enjoyed it, then it just starting getting.........Awful.
Overall:
A good started anime, but for people who have seen things other than Digimon, Pokemon, Dbz, anything on Adult swim, and Sailor moon, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS!!!!!!!!!!",4
"
                I used to think that naruto was an ok show. But then I realized there is no point in watching an anime that will NEVER END! Even after 220 episodes they still refuse to end it. Instead they make a sequel!And naruto is also the most annoying main character ever. after the 500th &quot;believe it!&quot;  the catch phrase tends to get annoying. one of the most annoying parts of the show are the flash backs.it gets really annoying when they show flash backs about the time that character stole a piece of bread or something right in the middle of an epic battle. another
                  thing that isn't really annoying but is kinda weird is that this show has head sets, giant televisions, stoves, cameras, etc but no cars or guns. just a little odd. so unless you have a thing for anime that doesn't have an ending, and has annoying characters this probably isn't an anime for you.",1
"
                Naruto (also referred to as ""Ninja Brokeback Mountain"") is an anime about sand ninjas and eugenics. It is a gateway anime of the worst kind riddled with one-dimensional characters who lack development, poor pacing, numerous plot holes, shitty villains who ""aren't really so bad in the end"", an anime saturated in filler arcs, a final arc with a complicated mess of a plot that stretched on for a year, massive use abuse of plot armor to cover up shitty writing, and a story of ""friendship"" which somehow makes Boku No Pico look like Metal Gear Solid in comparison. Despite this, it is one of /a/'s
                  guilty pleasures due to being a massive lolcow which has provided them with lulz for 15 years. The story is about a blonde-haired, afro hairstyled, blue-eyed, half-emo, foreigner half-demon ninja teen struggling to be accepted into society by being a whiny fagget who annoys everyone around him, including the viewers. His goal is to become Hokage Ninja Obama and change the world. To accomplish this he becomes a ninja who dresses in bright colors, doesn't into stealth, announces his presence to his enemies, literally only uses 2 jutsus for the entirety of the series, forgives mass murderers, and rather than killing enemies would rather give gay speeches about bonds and friendship and other shit. In fact, He is such a failure of a ninja that the plot replaced him with Sasuke ""Edge-Lord"" Uchiha as the main character halfway through the story due to Kishimoto's boner for his favorite character. One of the many themes in Naruto that are ultimately ignored is that hard work surpasses talent which is shown in how Naruto and Sasuke become the most overpowered characters by having perfect bloodlines and literally being handed power ups while characters like Rock Lee are ultimately forgotten by the plot. Great writing there, Kishimoto! Another lesson Naruto teaches is that if you stalk someone long enough, they will change their mind about you and will run back into your arms. 
You're better off watching a rock than this show.",1
"
                Alright, so let me start off by saying, boy, was I a non-believer of Naruto! I remember watching it on YTV when I was like 12 or 13, and the only thing I remember was hating it. I even remember making fun of Narutards, but now, about 4-5 years later, am a Narutard myself. xD So I just want to say that if something's holding you back, ignore it and try it out! A good handful of episodes (20-30) should get you hooked on! After both Naruto and Naruto: Shippudden, I can confidently say that this is one of the best anime I've watched so
                  far so I strongly recommend anyone to watch this series regardless of the genre you're interested in! 
So, let's get down to businessss:
Sound: 10/10
Naruto had one of the greatest soundtracks in all of anime (right behind Inuyasha that is!). I have felt all the emotions a human can possibly feel through the music itself. The fierce beating of the drums during the fights, soothing sound of the flute as Naruto reminisces about the past, upbeat instrumental as Pervy Sage sneaks a peek at the sexy ladies were a few of the many soundtracks that had me at the edge of my chair, crying, or at other times laughing 'till I fell off my chair! The sound in Naruto I found to be impeccable, and flawless, especially the OST.
Art:  8/10 
The art was good. Not amazing, I wouldn't say. But still pretty good. But if you're dissatisfied that there aren't that many hot guys ;) or girls, just wait 'till Shippudden! (Not to mention, another huge plus point is the yaoi/yuri fan-drawings you get to enjoy on DeviantArt or ZeroChan! ;) hehehe) But aside from the character drawings (which is still great!), the scenery were outstanding! My favourite colour is green, so I found the lush forests, and the soft paddy fields to be just absolutely breath-taking! The scenery really makes you want to live life in the edo period because it gives off the feeling that life is so relaxing!  
Story: 7.5/10
The story has a lot of potential (as you will see in Naruto: Shippudden), but unfortunately, there are a little too many filler episodes! But don't be discouraged because once you get addicted, you wouldn't care about the filler because the original plot is just too exciting! Besides, you can always skip the filler (search Google!). When you think it can't get any better, Naruto: Shippudden just surprises you with the improved pace! So, like I said, don't be discouraged if you think the pacing in Naruto is too slow and the plot isn't progressing, because in the next sequel, it really picks up! But apart from the warnings and ""bad things"", Naruto is a lot about friendship, and how they live life and fight against evil all while they stand beside their comrades. One thing for sure in Naruto, you know they've got each others' backs. Pardon the cheesyness but that's the main reason I like it so much! :3 
Character: 9/10
The characters are really easy to love! And it's just amazing when they fight together to fight evilll. (haha, there it is again, the cheesyness within me). It's so easy to laugh along with, fall in love with (sasori x deidara ;)), and just admire these characters! 
Enjoyment: 9/10
I never thought after completing Avatar the Last Airbender that I'd fall in love with a show again, but here it is, Naruto! I really enjoyed it! Throughout the whole time I was experiencing so many emotions - anger, happiness, fear, jealousy (Sasori! ;)), and depression. Naruto's up there on my list ;) (though Shippudden's higher ;D)
Overall: 8.5/10
Overall, it was a really enjoyable show and I'd recommend it to anyone especially if you'd like a series where you can get attached to the characters (a longer one rather than the short 12 or 26 episodic animes). Hope you enjoy it as much as I do and send me a message if you decide to try it out and how it goes with you! ;)
For now, I shall bid you adieu and get on to One Piece (hehe, my new addiction...)

                I believe that Naruto is in fact, if not the most, one of the most overrated and overestimated animes I have seen.
First of all, most characters seem very generic, and the some chracters (ESPECIALLY female) lack usefulness. Before you tell me I'm wrong, think about this: If YOU were to be watching a fight where your comrades and close friends may be fighting for their lives and chance to save yours, would YOU be there at the sides shouting their names and probably just distracting them, or would you stand up and fight along? Of course, at some point these certain characters did change. But
                  it would have been much better to make them at least a little more gutsy now, and have them progress later. Actually I would've rated their character even lower if it weren't for their development.
Then, we have the endless supply of fillers. (And so I pray, Unlimited Naruto filler works.) These fillers are episodes which have no real relation to the plot and are created for the sole reason of making the episode longer. Honestly, I think having some fillers are good, because if all episodes were following a plot, the series would go very fast. The fact that they introduce us to new characters doesn't change anything except if that character has a relation to the plot.
So, at first glance based on people saying how great this is, you may be thinking 'Ah, this is a pretty good series!' But you then start watching it, then you get bored of the fillers and sick of the useless characters that don't seem to die.
Personally, I actually would have continued with the next season if it wasn't for the fear of having to go through a whole bunch of fillers again.",6
"
                Okay. Well, at first, I saw my brother watching this series. At first I was like &quot;what is this series?&quot; Then I heard about this Naruto thing. So I decided to check it. I read the biograpy and was amazed of the plot. I'm not really a fan of action. But this series is not only about fighting. You will not like Naruto if you don't know the real story of it. Some of my classmates are saying that &quot;Naruto sucks!&quot; And I'm just saying that &quot;You just don't know the story. That's why you hate it.&quot; Each of the characters has their own talents,
                  dreams, and sad pasts. Especially Naruto, Gaara, and Sasuke. Sometimes I'm annoyed that there are tons of characters in the story. 
I gave all 10 because the story is great, especially the art. All of the characters has unique looks. Character, all of them has a story and has their own dreams, it made me inspired. Enjoyment, sometimes my mother would ask me if I'm crazy or something. I mean, laughing, talking, and crying  in front of the computer? xD
Overall, 10 Outsanding. =)
This is the very first Japanese dubbed anime I've ever watched. The anime I've watched is either in English or Tagalog dub. This anime made me addict and interested in anime. Before, I didn't know anything about anime. So, yeah.
Okay, I'll stop now. xD",10

                Overview:
Naruto has been going strong for 15 years now and is one of the most popular anime in the world. What exactly does this series do so well to gain such a massive fandom? Let's jump through some poorly animated trees and into a world where stealth assassins wear bright orange jump suits! This is Naruto!
Story: 6/10
Naruto takes place in a world where  ninjas are extremely common and perform many tasks: messengers, body guards, assassins, scientists, and even national leaders. The ninjas in this show don't actually conform to the stereotypes portrayed in cinema. In fact, they are often so far removed from everything
                  associated with ninja that they may as well just be called mutants or super heroes. What the hell does telepathically controlling sand have to do with being a ninja? I played Tenchu on the PS1 and I sure as hell wasn't killing people with fucking sand! Anyways, the plot follows the hyperactive, rambunctious, yet highly ambitious Naruto Uzumaki and his goal to become leader of his ninja village. Naruto has lived as an outcast his entire life because he has a demonic 9 tailed fox sealed inside him by his father. His father did this in order to stop the rampaging 9 tails from destroying the village and it ended up costing him his life. Naruto must use his powers to slowly win the trust and respect of his village and his fellow ninja team mates. The beginning of the series features a lot of training and tedious explanation of ""chakra"" and other concepts of the Naruto world. The story actually starts getting interesting when Naruto must take a special test called the Chuunin exam in order to gain a higher rank and go on more dangerous missions. I won't attempt to explain 15 years of plot in this small review, but trust me that the plot goes on FAR longer than necessary. Kishimoto keeps creating new enemies in order to drag it on longer and longer. Just when the latest big bad is defeated, we get to hear a sob story and learn that big bad #120 was actually being controlled by big bad #121, who it will turn out is merely a puppet in the schemes of #122. The plot is also bogged down by god awful filler that ranks among the worst shonen filler EVER! Ok, well not as bad as Inuyasha's filler, but still bad.
Character: 6/10
Naruto has a LOT of characters, some of whom are interesting and fun to watch and some of whom are an absolute pain in the ass. Unfortunately, Naruto is one of least interesting characters in the whole series. He redefines what it means to be a generic shonen hero cliche'. Sasuke spends the vast majority of the series being a whiny little twat that you just want to bitch slap. Sakura's affection for Sasuke seems extremely misplaced and she doesn't do anything useful until Shippuden starts...after episode 220. Hinata is actually one of the interesting characters. Like Shinji from Evangelion, she is the socially awkward, overwhelmed, nervous wreck that the otaku at home will probably most identify with. I'm certainly a LOT more Hinata than I am Naruto and I am willing to wager that so is nearly everyone else. Her struggles aren't so much about taking down impossibly strong villains, but learning how to express her feelings and get over her introversion and social anxiety. The real world nature of these problems make them infinitely more identifiable for the viewer. One of my other favorites is Gaara, who starts out as a lonely yet psychopathic ninja that brutally murders everyone that crosses his path. However, the show actually tries to make him sympathetic and largely succeeds. We get to see him slowly redeem himself and even become his country's leader. Apparently if you are strong in this world, your countless murders of innocent people are simply waved away and you can get selected to lead a nation. Hell yeah! Lucy/Gaara 2016! My other favorite characters include the absolute badass Itachi and pretentious artist Deidara.
Sound: 8/10
The soundtrack features many memorable openings and closings along with kickass instrumentals to pump up the fight scenes. Naruto also has just the right music to make tragic scenes moving and happy scenes more fun. It isn't the perfect anime soundtrack, but it is solid throughout.
Art: 6/10
The art isn't the greatest ever, but it isn't bad. You also have to consider the budgetary constraints of having a 500+ episode series when you groan at the use of poorly animated 3 second loops of characters jumping through trees. God damn Sasuke retrieval arc!
Enjoyment: 3/10
In Heart of Darkness we are left with the famous last utterance of Kurtz, ""the horror, the horror!"" In Naruto this would be ""The filler...the filler!"" Seriously, the awful filler content along with the tedious explanations whenever anyone uses any technique, make this series often painful to watch. I recommend the far superior manga. 
Overall: 6/10
Naruto has some things that it admittedly does quite well, along with a substantial list of flaws. I would ultimately say that it is a very average series. It is a good introduction to anime for the uninitiated, but there are honestly far better anime out there. There is also far, far worse. I'm not going to be the anime snob that tells young teens that Naruto is the single worst anime ever created. That would be a complete lie. I've sat through Ikki Tousen, Najika Blitz Tactics and Seikon no Qwasar, so I know what I'm fucking talking about.",6
"
                 Many first-timers love this anime and some experienced anime fans give this anime a poor score. However, this anime appeals to a wide range of teenagers for its classic shounen and comedy with slight romance.
 ______________________________________________________________
Story: 9/10
The only reason the story is only 9 is because of the stupid fillers from 140-220. If those weren't there this would definitely receive a 10. They aren't bad but sometimes it seems repetitive and you just want the story to move on. The story starts out with Naruto causing mischief again, but as the story progresses he becomes a little more mature. My favorite part of the
                  story is how Naruto has to prove to society that he is capable of being hogake, the best ninja in the village.  
 ______________________________________________________________
Art: 10/10
The art is great. The ninja moves they are all very detailed and has a good design. The character design is also very balanced.
 ______________________________________________________________
Sound: 10/10
The background music(bgm) is just amazing. I mean seriously, they fit perfectly with the atmosphere and enhance the scene. The opening songs are great and my favorite one is the last one, ""Yura Yura"" by Hearts Grow. Its been almost a year since I first heard that song and I am still addicted to it. The ending songs are also good because of the slow emotional feeling.
 ______________________________________________________________
Character: 10/10
It may not seem like a 10 in the beginning, but trust me after a while the characters get to be one of its best aspects. The three main characters all have different personalities and they change as the story goes. The supporting characters are great because they're not just forgotten about and actually play a part in the story.
 ______________________________________________________________
Enjoyment: 9/10
It is a great anime for fans of martial arts and hand-to-hand combat. The reason that I enjoyed it was because the way Naruto never gives up was just inspiring to me.
 ______________________________________________________________
Overall: 9/10
This will always be one of the best anime I have ever watched, and I highly recommend you to try it. By the way this is my first review, so tell me if it was helpful or not.",9
"
                This is one of the most over rated animes ever, i may say that this review is abit biased seeing as ive watched only 2 episodes in a row, but through friends ive watched well over 30 of tid bits of episodes. But i remain uncertain of why this anime is so good. To me its only a good &quot;cartoon&quot; not anime. For only non full anime fans watch this who don't know what a good anime REALY is. and comparing this to other animes its TERRIBLE. Nothing good can be said about naruto in my eyes. The japanes voices are so kiddy and terrible
                  acting and little good for the bubs. The story jsut DRAGS N' DRAGS. Although the characters i can say some what of good about there &quot;coolitude&quot; and the art is rather good. It's bright and creative and creates a somewhat decent atompshere in each scenerio.
But this is not a good anime and i dont recomend watching it.
if i was to recomend a good starter anime, I WOULD NVER SAY NARUTO.
I would recomend either Gintama or Bleach. They both have a fantastic comeical side and serious fighting side.
if u dont watch niether of them still avoid THIS RUBBISH and instead watch Inuyasha
OR on a logn shot Yu-gi-oh

"
                First off: The fillers are definately not worth watching ( probably the only exception is ep101 or 105, can't remember which, where Naruto and crew tried to get Kakashi to reveal what's under his mask). They are just random episodes made out of the blue, and contain no storyline whatsoever ( unlike the Bount Arc).
Story up to the end of ...: This part of Naruto got me glued to my monitor. The plot rapidly unfolds in this arc, and new characters rapidly intoduced. Lots of wonderful fighting scenes, with little or no character. Very good.
After the aforementioned arc to beginning of filler season: here characters
                  are explored to more detail, also the plot is made more complex. Some good action scenes here, of course the best one being the fight between X and X. However, after this point, the plot deteriorates, it became dull and generic.Humours are used in an attempt to maintain audience attention, but became predictable as the story goes. 
Overall: There are many shorter, more interesting series out there with the same genre. If you, however, enjoy extended series, you might find Naruto enjoyable.",7

                Story >>>
Firstly story is awesome but has some minor setback & those to due to some more than needed fillers , but anyway i being a really big fan of ninjas like it very much , Don't think too much & just go for it , those who do think too much of the story just end up finding flows , i can find major flaws in series like FMA also but then again i just accept the series for it offers
One thing i like is , unlike One Piece Naruto has properly divided the story in intervals , so you may expect any big
                  saga to last a proper 30-40 episodes max , whereas in one piece i used to get bored with each saga lasting 60+ episodes that was too annoying
Animation >>>
It is definitely great but the characters could have been made too look like real ninjas , i somehow don't like that characters don't cover up their faces with masks , this is rather related to drawing ut anyway since there isn't a drawing rating thing i am writing this here , apart from that the animation in fight scenes is especially awesome with all the chakara effects , in chidori & rasengan
Sound >>>
Well the flute sound effects are just too awesome & it's been 3 years now since i started watching naruto & still the flute sound effects for the good guy characters are way too awesome than any soundtrack i ever heard
Characters >>>
Now you will be annoyed by some of the young characters but it overall i feel please use the japanese voice , as i feel VIZ Have not done justice to the character of naruto , because of his screeching voice , the fat chick that did his dubbing should be fired , i like the English dub apart from that & yeah you will be more attached to the characters as the story progresses , if you don''t believe me , i guarantee that those of you who look for emotions in anime will like Chouji once you see episodes from 130 - 135 , other characters also grow on you once the series progresses , one thing i would like too point out is i hate Alphonse elric from fma coz he is too annoying with his goody goody attitude in even the darkest situation like not killing homonculus even if they are killing people elrics love , but in naruto i did not find any character who does not understand the situation & act totally different in a irritating manner , so yeah characters are really good
I Personally like characters who i can idolize & who encourage me , as these are the people who can do no wrong & so i like to look up to them instead of real life people who have some dirt on them always , with that said Naruto is the perfect person to look up to as a role model especially when he grows up in shippuden , but that is a different tale
Enjoyment >>>
It is a perfect blend of action , comedy & knows when to relieve you from all the action & knows how to boost your excitement with memorable fights , so be sure that when you watch this anime you will never regret viewing it",9

                Characters/Development
Although the beginning of the story may not give much of an impression and suggest the characters are going to be having childish adventures together. The series is actually much different than expected which does get interesting the further the story develops. Of course to be expected there are many fight sequences adding a lot of action to the series, but more on that later.
Throughout Naruto there are many different story arcs which usually link together explaining the plot more in depth filling some holes, teaching us pieces of the past or developing certain characters more. The series however does tend to drag on a
                  lot for each episode or fight sequences which may take a while to conclude. Many flashbacks are also included which take two different approaches. One that develop the character or explain an event either briefly or in depth. One that are to remind the audience of previous episodes, sometimes even during the early moments of an episode. The latter tend to get boring and eventually rather annoying. Added into the mix of things are a few emotional moments for characters and some comedy which might give a chuckle but nothing too hilarious except one or two events.
The characters in this series are rather unique in several ways. They each have their very own skills, ambitions and views upon certain matters. Most of the characters are focused on the younger generation, while there are still plenty of the older generation to experience, creating a large collection of likable or dislikeable characters. To pick a few, we have Naruto who appears to be quite dumb in understanding things, but has a good heart and knows how to get out of sticky situations during combat. His views can be quite mature for his age and the audience may sympathise with him at times. Then we have Sasuke who is the quiet vengeful type, of whom is seeking to kill his brother and the revival of his clan. Although having a dark atmosphere around him he can worry about his team and even become jealous of Naruto. We than have Sakura who appears to be a sweet girl, having her heart set on Sasuke, yet she can get in some bad tempers and show her other personality. Finally you have Kakashi, the team leader of the three, of adult age, who can be quite a likable character. He loves reading romance themed books of a certain series and is constantly later when meeting up with the team. Throughout the series, the skills and ways of each character is reflected in one way or another so we can learn the way they are like on the battlefield or within a group.
The combat is a little different than expected at a slower pace and being tactical rather than having much physical contact. Lots of thrown weapons are used, or types of hand seals, which can either, improve an aspect of themselves or use as a form of attack in battle. Most fights can get quite violent with some bloody scenes here and there. Problems with these fight sequences most noticable are the fact the characters involved talk too much. It can be interesting to learn how they pulled of a certain strategy, or what their attacks actually do to their opponents or surroundings. Another problem are the flashbacks, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense when characters are facing against an enemy. Yet another problem is the constant usage of the same move from time to time which did get rather boring as well. Most fights during the series are conflicts that take place during the storyline while others tend to show the characters skills off a little, such as the Chuunin exam, which they take to become middle rank ninja. The series may take its story arcs at a slow pace but it eventually concludes the first main part of the story in 135 episodes, while the rest are filler episodes, which can be watched optionally as, they don&rsquo;t develop the story any further. I never did watch them.
Animation/Scenery
Art and animation improve over time and also seem to be done differently at certain points in the series. Firstly the animation starts off quite dull in the beginning episodes but quickly picks up from there. Most simple actions are done in a simple manner, but most noticeable difference are during the fight sequences, which can take two different approaches towards them which I&rsquo;ll explain a little later. There are quite a lot of still shots throughout either type of scene to possibly lengthen the episodes on helping to drag the series on a little longer. There are a few moments where the animation can get awkward from time to time. Effects for the techniques and powers seem to have been done fairly well too.
The two types of combat animation is best explained by using the words, slow and fast which now should be fairly obvious. During the slow combat situations, they contain a lot of talking and quick attacks or moves here and there being rather paced and tactical while the level of detail in each scene is still there. It is quite the opposite for the faster paced combat, more directed towards the physicals sides of fighting through punching and kicking. The scenes are much more quicker paced yet the level of detail is lower than normal for both the scenes and characters, yet more interactiveness to the environment around them.
Character designs overall can have a similar look to each other resorting to uses of different facial or clothing accessories. However, they are quite unique and fairly recognisable between them, while remaining well drawn. The best noticeable ways of making some characters stand out are these examples; The head guard covering Kakashi&rsquo;s left eye, Lee&rsquo;s large eyes and fuzzy eyebrows, while being nicknamed by Naruto for having so and Shiino&rsquo;s sunglasses, with the top of his coat masking most of his face. Most of the lesser characters such as guards have a rather simple look between them. This also helps these characters stand out quite well from the rest making them interesting, especially once you learn more about them in the series.
Art wise, the series uses a lot of soft, bright tones for the characters and objects while being slightly saturated looking for the scenery. During the first few episodes the art seemed quite dull, but again quickly improves like everything else, getting sharper and visually more appealing. The scenery is also made quite well using consistent blends of colour and schemes. The village of Konoha uses a lot of brighter colours such as reds and greens to detail the locations. While for the hidden village of sand uses many yellows and yellowish looking cream colours. The makes the locations also unique in appearance just like the characters. Fights take place in different types of locations instead of barren landscapes, and vary between them during the series such as woodlands, bridges and canopy of trees to name a few depending on the situation.
Audio/Music
There are quite a lot of sound effects and music that create a nice set and compile together pretty well during either of the scenes where used. The contact of thrown weapons on wood, flesh or material is used correctly as well as the other sounds being timed right, no major complaints in this area. These sounds eventually become much more common and easy to recognise after a several episodes or less. Music is a nice highlight to the series, quite unique in tune mixing a bit of modern or rock with old style or chants. Each track has its one touch, being used well throughout the series during the correct scenes. These also become common and quite enjoyable where I&rsquo;ve found myself tapping my feet to them as they start up. New tracks are introduced as the series progresses and some can make certain scenes much more exciting to watch, emotional of funnier depending on the scene again. Never had a problem with the voice actors, but found the mysterious or evil characters fit their role, being reflected towards the audience well.
Conclusion
An interesting series that isn&rsquo;t for everyone out there, which can be either liked or hated. Many characters and action sequences which are usually approached well although the series does tend ot drag on, while being combined with good sound and music throughout. Enjoyable watch putting the slow pace aside, yet an over rated series.",7

                This review is from my personal assessment of episodes 1 to 135, inclusive, of the Naruto series.  I will try to do something interesting in this review, and that is to review the anime at the time it was aired and touch on its impact on me at the time it was aired.  If there were ever a series that had vastly extreme views, it would have to be this one.  And thus, this is why I had to review it, to contribute my thoughts into this sensitive subject.
What is Naruto?  It is an action series that appeared out of nowhere
                  that, in my opinion, along with Bleach, defined the action/adventure/drama genre.  By saying that a series defined a genre, it does not mean that series is the best from that genre.  It merely means that the series, at that time, came out and boosted the enjoyment and popularity of that genre, also becoming one of the most popular of that genre. That series will be compared to when people talk of the genre, and newer series of the same genre will aim to surpass it. That is, by my definition, what is means to define a genre.
Story: 7/10
From the moment it came out I was hooked. The story was catchy, and the action was already present in the first episode.  What really impressed me was the second episode, which introduced a very common sub-genre into the action genre, and that is comedy.  The pacing of the series was good, the suspense was there, the comedy was there, and there was this yearning to find out more about all the other ninjutsu and fighting styles that were also there.
The plot, in itself, was pretty bad and didn't make a lot of sense to me.  Basically, each ninja is supposed to find &quot;their way of being a ninja&quot; and by doing so, many of them broke the rules for being a ninja.  By being a ninja, one has to put their mission above all of their emotions, but the series is completely based on themes of loneliness, sadness, friendship, and all this stuff that's about emotions.  However, this was what I analyzed after looking back at the series.  Back then, the plot was good enough for me to keep my interest in it; therefore, I gave it an overall seven.
Art: 8/10
The action scenes are quite cool back then since it was really some of the most impressive action sequences that I have ever seen.  The art, not animation, was just mediocre.  Nothing really stands out, and while the ninjas &quot;teleporting&quot; from place to place looks cool, it is really just easier to animate.  I will argue that the lack of artistic involvement does not affect my enjoyment of the series significant, and from a director's point of view, a long series such as this cannot afford to spent much more time on art.
Sound: 10/10
The background music was what blew me away.  Sometimes it is soothing and sad, other times it is cheery, and during action scenes, it is catchy and fun.  Without Naruto's famous background music scores, the quality of the series would really go down drastically, since hearing is one of the senses that is necessary to draw someone completely into a series.  Naruto did just that, so I will give Toshiro Masuda, the composer for the Naruto scores, my highest regards.
Character: 7/10
Looking at each character at a time, they all have great development.  Of course, everyone's favorite is Haku, and it is for a very good reason.  I still think that Haku's &quot;arc&quot; is the best arc of Naruto, simply because of the huge amount of emotions that the arc conveys.  Naruto, Sasuke, and Gaara all have their own sad pasts, and it is common for the characters' actions to be driven by events that happened to them in the past.  This, in a sense, unifies the plot and shows mastery of character development.  After all, the past, present, and future plays a huge role of &quot;their way of ninja.&quot;  There is one flaw when you look at the overall picture, however.  All of the main characters seem to suffer from the same sad and bitter past, which gets repetitive after a while.  
Enjoyment: 10/10
After all of this criticism, I just plainly and inexplicably enjoyed the series.  Naruto is one series where equations don't work out and analyses fail.  I can find so many flaws about it, but yet, it is just so damn enjoyable.  There were many memorable scenes, such as Haku's loyalty and Sakura's feelings.  Anime can be watched, enjoyed, and tossed away, but the ones that create vivid memories are the ones that you enjoy the most.
Overall: 7/10
Remember that I am only reviewing this anime up to episode 135, so fillers are not included. I personally think that the fillers ruined the anime, and they were such a drastic failure that we forgot about the time when Naruto was enjoyable.  Yes, I think that Naruto is just a mediocre series now and not as good as it used to be.  However, I will never forget the amount of enjoyment this series have given me, and I will give it a fair rating on how much it meant to me.  Naruto was part of my early anime experience, and it was one of the reasons why I am such an anime fan today.  I owe a lot to this series, and even though it might not be great now, it is a series I will always remember.",7
"
                I have not done a review in awhile and the reason for doing a review on such a popular anime is that I've checked a lot of random peoples profile to get anime inspiration as well as to compare and only about 40% had seen Naruto!!! This is not including those that dropped it or put it on hold etc. but how does one not attempt to watch it?! Obv. it is not for all people but here's my review anyway.
Story- It's your classic underdog story that a lot of people can relate with. Let's face it, people in America can be very cruel to
                  others that openly express their love for anything unorthodox. This is a anime full of struggle and perseverance, the message is so clear and motivating it's just as motivating after watching one of the Rocky movies (If for some reason you don't like Rocky make another analogy for something that pumps you up and it's equivalent to Naruto). The comedy is pretty good and they do not repeat the same jokes so that is a blessing. Why wasn't this a 10? Well I will tell you that the huge problem with this and its sequel is the damn FILLER! The filler is pretty awful not gonna lie. Trust me when I say do not quit the show because of it; worst comes to worst google where the filler ends and start from that ep. and skip all the filler; it's more enjoyable that way.
Art- The art is good, not great. The fights, characters, justu and all the other effects look cool but in the original Naruto it's much less crisp. The colors are not as powerful as they could be and maybe it gives it a cool vintage feel but this is all about preference.
Sound- This deserves a freakin 10! The soundtrack is easily something you can download to your i-pod it's so catchy. Every opening is great. I do not know why but I really do not listen to a lot of enjoyable ending songs, honestly I can think out of all the anime I have seen I only enjoy 4 ending songs. This show doesn't have great endings. That is not why I did not rate it  a 10; it is because of the Dub. I have seen this show with both languages and lemme tell ya, the Dub gets very obnoxious. Sub is the way to go.
Character- This show has more development than a teenager. Important people can die remember that it is not all sunshine and rainbows. The heroes you will love and the villains are beyond dark and evil and you will love to hate them. Enough said...   
Overall a nostalgic, easily rewatchable funny action packed anime. If you haven't seen it please do yourself a favor and watch it. Skip the filler and enjoy the fun ride Naruto will take you on. And.... it is part of the current big 3 if you count Naruto and Shippuden the same show as I do... just saying...",8

                The anime series goes well with the manga (sort of) there are of filters that can confused those who never read the manga on what's going on. The whole show is great especially for kids ranged 10+ up  and it sets out the whole &quot;never give up on your dreams&quot; attitude there are some humor around it sometimes, but it still forced striaght to the main part of the story. Whatever you liked reading it, watch the anime version from Viz or in it's original dub it's still a good show to watch. Although I quite suggest not to watch the filter arc when
                  toonami shows them. I could even recommend this to any shonen beginners because of the story artwork and good fight scenes (ones that do not inclued Sakura because she's weak).",10
"
                This show literally blows my mind out of the park this is the first anime show that i ever saw and it hooked me on to anime in a instant. naruto is about a boy with a nine tailed fox inside him hepling him through obstacles,with him and team seven consiting of sakura haruno kakashi hatake and the very good looking sasuke uchiha, basically shows the missions that team 7 goes on and everything. but the other side of the story is that sasuke is trying to avenage his clans death after is brother itachi uchiha kills then and tells sasuke to become stonger. also
                  his brother itachi is part of this organization called the akatsuki. there is more but i dont want to write anymore and you should just watch it",10

                Yeah ^^ ..Naruto was my second Anime and I liked it :) .. Of course the filler have really sucked, but the first 135 Episodes were really good ..especially the animation in fights were awesome and the fighting-system is well through-thought.. However  i am looking forward to Shippuuden and I hope Ill enjoy this as much as I have enjoyed the first 135 Eps of Naruto ;) .. (sorry for my bad english ^^)

                This anime....well it is something else. I enjoyed watching every episode. The music was so upbeat and keeps an audience hooked. Every episode, I was either on the edge of my seat in suspense, or I was on the floor laughing. This anime incoorporates humor and all seriousness in one. This is definaltly an anime that I will remember forever. 
The characters are very different and the viewers can find a way to relate to at least one of them. (Sasuke and I for example.) 
The plot is very well thought out. The only thing that I hated about this anime was the fillers. They
                  didn't need to add them. It ruined the plot. And it was going so well...
I seriously recommend this for anyone who is into suspense, action, doesn't mind a little blood, drama, romance (a little..) and comedy. Naruto has all of those components to be one of the greats that will always be remembered when the fandom dies down.",10

                Well the more experienced anime viewers are going to give reviews of probly 5 and lower while the beginers are going to say it was outstanding and naruto is just one of those animes where you hate it or love it. Naruto is a big anime for kids and alot of anime biginers watch this anime because its so huge in the anime world that they think why not? so i am going to give this review all ive got.
~Story~
 Well what can you say The plot is accually pretty fair and original on the basis of ninjas hokage ect. but i think it dragged
                  on far too long with hundreds of episodes and its still not over its alot like one piece and bleach in that it just wont seem to end the start of naruto is great untill you get about half through the original series and it just gets boring and pointless and then with shippuden it goes good and then bad again but we will stick to the original naruto. I found that the series is alot of fillers and no real plot line other than alot of ahem sakura screaming sasuke but thats not really the point lol. 
~Characters~
One word: Dull.....The characters grow sure but they dont really seem to well its hard to explain ill say it an easier way. The characters are idiots because all they focase on is find sasuke oh he killed aton of people oh well lets find him anyway its like a huge game of tag in this anime they chase sasuke he chases them over and over again its dull and boring.
~Overall~
 To new people to anime watch this but to experienced people in the anime community dont bother you wont be missing much other than alot of screaming. =\ 5/10",5

                Story- Well if you haven't already seen at least an episode or two of this show online,on tv,or you live in a box then let me give you a little bit of the main story to this great anime. In the beggining the show starts of with a sort of flashback of the ninja leaf village. You see that there is a terrible demon that is attacking the village. The narrator will go on to tell you that the hokage of the village sealed the spirit of the fox demon in a little boy, and this boy is Naruto. After that it will start in
                  the modern time of the story. Naruto will go on to make many friends in the ninja academy and go on many adventure through out this anime as this show is a 220 episode series with many story arcs. From episode 135 to 220 though there are filler episodes(episodes that are not original to the manga) created because the author could not start on working on the next story of this show because the anime episodes were catching up to the releases of the manga. Anyway you will notice as the story goes on the development of the characters and their maturity.
Characters-
Naruto- He's a imature at the beggining but becomes more serious when his friends or comrades are in danger.
Sasuke- His style is to be considered as emo due to him being in an almost always depressed laid back sort of mood. (Will you learn more about later in the series about his family etc.)
Sakura- She's kind of annoying to most people that watch this show because of her weakness in the beggining of the show and her complaining and competiveness to win Sasukes heart.
Kakashi- A very quiet teacher to the squad but you will learn more about his background in the series. He's very strong and protective though.
Animation Quality- The animation quality of this show is not very high mainly for the reason being that this is quite a long show and was aired weekly.
Pros-  This anime has a very addictive story line and characters as well as good morals at times. The fighting is pretty good and is overall a very entertaining anime. It also has some funny humor at times.
Cons- This anime does not have the best animation quality and the story line is a little predictable at times. But you do have to remember that this is an anime more for a younger audience.",9
"
                well naruto is a very interesting anime its about a young idiotic persevering little boy. he causes a lot of trouble and he wants to become the greatest hokage. naruto has the 9 tailed fox spirit in him that almost destroyed the hidden leaf village. naruto likes to succede but he is still too weak. naruto's catch phrase is BELIEVE IT!!! he says that when anyone does not believe in him.
naruto is truly an amazing anime. the reason i like naruto is because it was my first anime. naruto gave me the courage to try new animes. so i would give this anime 5 stars.

                I love Naruto for being funny, inspirational, action packed, and tragic at the same time. Each story arc protrays different characters, with tragic pasts and how their lives change. Overall storyline itself is fantabulous. Character developement is also awesome. To be honest, one of the characters has helped me understand myself littel better now. Some of the themes (Orochimaru's theme, etc) are awesome and the art is good too. Since it is shounen, so you also have lot of action, which is top notch as well. The only disappointing aspects of the series might be its' speed at which it covers the manga and the
                  fillers. But if you only watch anime and love action packed. comedy anime, you better give this a try. Just avoid the fillers like I did and enjoy the show.",9
"
                Premise:
Fictional feudal-style Japan, where the Ninjas roam wearing cool SWAT costumes. Besides that, they also have Dragon Ball style ""chi"".
Character:
There's only 3 characters you need to know:
Naruto - The main character (hence the anime title) who is a mediocre ninja if not for the hidden demon inside him.
Sakura - A useless girl who serves no purpose in this anime, a liability who always got in the way of other people.
Sasuke - An emo boy who thinks he's the center of the world.
Relationships:Naruto has a crush on Sakura because he thinks she's cute, even though she's a b*tch to him.
Sakura is obsessed on Sasuke because she likes the typical bad boy type.
Sasuke thinks Naruto is his rival and get pissed when Naruto is stronger than him. But actually Sasuke is just confused by his love for Naruto.
Plot:
Fight, fight, fight, training. Fight, fight fight, training. Fight, fight, fight. 
Oh, the bad guys can also just teleport when they want to retreat after they were defeated, while the good guys are SOL when they are out powered by the bad guys.",6
"
                Style - It's ok. Some parts (e.g Lee vs Gaara fight) are decent, other parts are not so great. 2 out of 3. 
Character - The main flaw with Naruto characters is that they are clinically retarded. Ninjas are supposed to be stealthy, right? There wasn't a single stealthy ninja in the whole of naruto. Naruto wears a orange jumpsuit, Sakura wears red, Sasuke wears blue, the Akatsuki wear black cloaks with red clouds and everyone wears a shiny light-reflecting ""forehead protector"". Sure is stealthy. You see, normal people tend to avoid fighting for no good reason as it means getting hurt, noticed, and arrested.
                  Naruto characters on the other hand start fights for no reason at all other than to bolster their incredibly fragile egos. Naruto is an impulsive idiot. Sasuke is an arrogant asshole. Sakura is useless. In addition, all of the characters are immature, naive, and lazy. Oh yeah, did I mention the fact that Naruto charges headlong into every fight, breaking formation and getting his ass kicked, every single time? He must have brain damage from getting beaten up so often. 0 out of 4. 
Story - The story of Naruto is complete nonsense. Throwing knives are crap as ranged weapons. It'd be easier to just sneak up on someone and stab them with it. Why does nobody use a bow and arrow in Naruto? They already have computer screens. The original Eastern concept of chakra was taken by Naruto and made into magic points that allow you to break the laws of physics. Naruto originally wanted to be a hokage. Now he's more interested in retrieving Sasuke. Okay let's go through the plot. First there was the Zabuza mission, where I thought they should have died. Zabuza alone could have taken all of them out but he wasted too much time chatting around. Then there's Haku, who was about to kill both Naruto and Sasuke when suddenly Naruto's 9-tailed fox guardian came out of nowhere and saved the day. This then happens every single time Naruto is in trouble - the 9 tailed fox saves the day. It gets repetitive and sends all the wrong messages to the kids (no hard work needed, just call the 9 tailed fox!!). Also, how Naruto defeated Kiba in the preliminary exam was just incredibly stupid, needless to say shitting your pants wouldn't save you from someone determined to beat the shit out of you in real life. Oh yeah and Naruto gives speeches that instantly turns villains into good guys. 0 out of 3. 
Overall 2 out of 10 for retarded characters and nonsensical plot.",2

                I have been watching this show since it came out in America but they took it off because they wasent getting enough ratings now the y have brought it back to us with new and imporved work as well as art in the show. I can't believe that people really didn't wacht it before but now sever one is in this show until it gets to the next version of it. I love wathing anime ever since I can remember of my past i know that i will never stop watching it

                Story:The first main story arc is one of the best through the series and the rest until  the last real story arc are decent. But then probably one of the stupidest thing happened in history. Instead of continuing the real story for a year and half they made filler. Bad filler, filler that makes you question wither your time should be waisted with this. And a lot of people though that it was a waist of there time and stopped watching. That is why I gave it a 5. If they didnt give it the most amount of filler ever it would have been
                  a 8.
Animation: pretty good, nothing note worthy.
Sound: enjoyable nothing special.
Character: Well lets just say this. Naruto is a pretty lame character. He is lame and will always be lame. (he is super lame in the fillers, I think I saw him use one move in all the episodes I saw) But the saving grace is the side characters. Great I wish that some of the side characters were the main hero instead of Naruto.
Enjoyment: Up the the part where the real last story arc ends, pretty good 8
but then the filler hits that got it a 5.
Overall: I would have given this a 8 but that filler is a real problem",5

                Naruto is may favorite anime series and manga series.  I started reading the manga when I was a pre-teen but dropped it after a while, because certain story elements bothered me (such as Naruto's unrelenting love for his rival).  However, when I was 17 I picked it up again because I was bored and had nothing to read, I was hooked all over again, part 2 starts slow but it picks up, and when I say that I mean it gets extremely epic and interesting.  But this review is about Part 1, and the anime adaption of it.
Well, part 1 Naruto tells
                  the story of a young Tom Sawyer-ish trouble maker kid who wants to be a ninja.  It doesn't take long for him to graduate ninja school and begin his journey to become a legendary shinobi, however it's not just Naruto to watch this show for, the supporting cast and antagonists, especially in Part 1, are what make this story shine.  Some of the most beautifully sad stories I've ever read/seen (in this case seen) are depicted within this anime, and it's just an amazing story that no one should miss.  It enthralled me as a child, and astounded me as an adult, the level of thought, symbolism, and hidden details within this story could only be crafted by geniuses, which would be Kishimoto and his editors.
All the characters are interesting, have unique personalities, sometime horrific pasts and secrets, and a good lot of them are extremely likable, such as everyone's favorite teacher Kakashi or the goofy underdog with passion Rock Lee.  Even some of the most menacing antagonists you'd never think you'd care about, suddenly show that even they are worth your empathy.  There's a good reason this is the biggest hit anime series to sweep america, and that's due to the overwhelmingly strong story, characters, and masterfully orchestrated soundtrack.
Now, sure it's amazing, but there are negatives, most which are exclusive to the anime adaption and not the manga.  While the anime adaption does a great job portraying the most important scenes, with fantastic animation and great music placement and sound, the entire thing isn't this way.  This is because different directors and animation teams worked on different parts of the show, so one director could be brilliant, and one could have a lower budget and not be so brilliant, thus the art and execution are inconsistent in areas.
That's not the only negative however, this show has these annoying things called fillers, which are additional story arcs added on that weren't part of Kishimoto's original manga.  These are pretty cheesy and badly written and should be skipped, except for a particular comedic episode about attempted to remove Kakashi's mask.  If you want to enjoy the show to it's full potential these should be skipped, especially the huge lot of them towards the end.
Another thing is censorship.  In the manga, there are some scenes that are just far to graphic for whatever timeslot the anime aired in Japan, such as a particular scene where a rogue shinobi is has naked corpses hung on the walls and is removing their limbs and dissecting them.  Scenes like this are replaced with stuff that's less graphic but still sorta gets the point across.
It's a shame such a great anime with a strong soundtrack and legendary source material has such blaring issues, but that's what bumps it down to a 9, it isn't a perfect adaption, has inconsistent art (but great at times) and various other annoying changes or additions that hamper my enjoyment of the Naruto manga in motion.
I recommend skipping the fillers for the best viewing experience, but regardless, this is a story you won't forget, with characters you won't forget, moments you won't forget, and feelings you won't forget.
There's no score more appropriate for this show other than a 9/10.",9
"
                This anime is not very good.
The characters are unlikable, and ironically, the worst one is the main protagonist. They are all annoying and mind-wrenching, and distract from the story.
It's executed poorly, and it takes way too long for fights, and explaining attacks, making the show too slowly-paced for an action show. 
Basically, this show is OK-for a kid. For someone like me, spoiled with Death Note and Urelmo, I hate it.

                Naruto! Oh wow! This is the BEST anime I had ever seen! I ranked it #1 on my anime list actually. Naruto is very inspirational, full of good values and adventures that wil take each one of us in very thrilling fantasy. Because of this anime I became more and more like Naruto, friendly, brave and  strong! I adore every statement of the characters, even if  he/she is bad or good. This anime shows not only fantasy but also reality. It reveals every characters' sorrows and happy moments. I believe that this anime is NOT boring, you will eventually get closer to the
                  true personality of each characters, you could feel hatred or be amaze of that certain character.
Story: THE BEST. I rated it as an outstanding one. Every episodes lead to another closer look to the character. I know it got lot of fillers, but it doesn't really matter!! What matter is to understand the importance of the story not what you are seeing wrong on the series.
Art: THE BEST.I rated it again as the best because of the well-made fighting scenes although there are a lot of troubles in the fighting sequences.
Sound: THE BEST. I really like the sound, the BGM and most especially the OP and ED songs! The BGM suits every scenes and every character, from the happiest to the saddest music.
Character: THE BEST. Very well molded characters. Each revealing unique attitudes and emotions. Naruto series really shows that each one of us iare UNIQUE.
Enjoyment: I really enjoy this anime! It makes me happy all day! 
And I rated this anime as a top-notched. Thanks Kishimoto,for making this anime full of adventure and thrill!",10

                **Has Been Re-Edited, Watched as of Episode 62**
Story - 5.6/10 (F+)
What story? Oh the Ninja boy wants to be the best. Where have i heard this from before? Like countless other shounen shows. But only Naruto has the balls to actually bore us with pointless slapstick comedy and 3-4 episode long fights that hardly resolve anything except more questions. Naruto is like a trainwreck, it's so bad yet you still watch it to laugh at it. 
Animation - 5.0/10 (F)
Aside from the whole &quot;Sexy Ninjitsu&quot; thing, all of it rarely ever changes. It feels so old and worn out, nothing else catches my eyes.
Sound: -
                  7.8/10 (C+)
This is where i change my tone for the most part. I can honestly say i like every single opening of Naruto, it fits the mood for the first 1:30 of the show, then the other 21 minutes is just horrible. The soundtrack is alright, but just that.
Character: - 4.8/10 (F)
We have: Naruto, our favorite ramen-loving, orange jumpsuit ninja. Ok? We mostly have the same old characters until we get Jiraya and Orochimaru and Itachi. Even with them, it still feels so old and dead by now, that's where i stopped watching it.
Enjoyment: - 8.0/10 (B)
So why the hell did i enjoy it? Well, it seems that EVERY SINGLE EPISODE, Naruto screws up. That there is enjoyment. Whether it's an assault by Sakura, or just plain screw up, i love it (it's supposed to be a bad thing, by the way.). I can watch the filler episodes and just laugh so damn hard at Naruto failing.
Overall (Averaged, thank the Enjoyment rating.. :) ): - 5.8/10 (F)
If you're a basement-dwelling, friendless moron than this show is for you! If you love anime, has tons of friends, and does well in school, THIS SHOW IS NOT FOR YOU.

The Bad: About everything else",5
"
                the modern day prototypical shonen anime, it exemplifies what shonen is all about with a young hero and his friends, including lots of action and humor. I really enjoyed watching this, I gave it an 8 for story when it actually was sticking to the main story line, I didn't count the filler episodes, which i admit make up pretty much the second half of the entire series, but even the fillers brought some good chuckles for me, and a couple of action gems. The art was pretty good, and I'll say that look forward to a very important fight, where the animation takes two
                  steps up. The sound or music I assume was pretty good, and the OP and ED of the anime were fun to listen to, especially Haruka Kanata (OP2). The characters are awesome, some of my favorites are in this anime, although some may dislike Sakura... I wholeheartedly recommend this anime to anyone that enjoys shonen anime, unless you're the type that's more into real deep stuff, and you think you're too high and mighty to watch it.",8
"
                Okay so the art and sound was of any anime, but that's not the point. The story seemed intesting at one point, but it fell apart. Way too nija cliché . It was devastating. I heard so much about this series and was expecting so much more. The characters were simple. The main character was the ""apprentice wants to become the best there is and travels with his friends to achieve his goal"" kind, which we haven't seen much of *coughPOKEMONcough*. It was dumb. And the humor was terrible too. I think that this anime is really only meant for anime junkies or otakus who
                  don't care much for the story and just care for the cool outfits and sayings in the stories. This story had way too much of bad comedy, obssessed girls(which tried too hard to be funny and it sucked), and a lame plot. It really ticks me off that people even dare compare this series to Bleach. ? Really? Bleach actually has some depth to the plot and some sensibility in it. It shows devotion, romance, trust, and all the rich ingredients of a hit show. Naruto may have devotion but its cheap and crappy. This was such a let down. :[ Sorry all Naruto fans.",3
"
                Erm. Yes, I'm advocating for the positive side of Naruto... Just don't shoot the messenger :P
Currently, there are 26 reviews written for Naruto, out of which roughly more than half advocate that Naruto sucks, is not worth watching, and is simply overrated. 
Right. So we know that the fillers are horrible, the plot's &quot;typically shounen&quot; and Sakura never does a single thing. But why exactly has Naruto become so popular? What makes it tick? What keeps reeling in the dough for Kishimoto?
There are a variety of reasons.
Naruto is the very embodiment of the shounen psyche. It deals with some common fundamental themes that appeal to
                  the audience. Valuing your friends, never giving up, and challenging the status quo are just a couple messages conveyed by Naruto's plight. And we, the viewers, can relate to those themes. Supposedly.
Then of course, are the insane battle scenes. True, some battles are incapable of suspending disbelief, as you think &quot;that's doesn't make sense.&quot; Then there are the parts where someone has to explain every move he makes. However, overall, the animation, the music, and the &quot;situation&quot; all add up into something that excites and awakens the ninja within us. (Wow, that was corny)
There's also a fair bit of humor involved. Most of it is slapstick comedy, such as the teasing born from the Naruto-Sasuke rivalry, while other comic scenes truly manage to touch the humerus (episode 101, anyone?). However, some of the older viewers are nonplussed by many scenes which simply come across as stupid and juvenile. Though i'm sure Kishimoto knew crass humor is a double edged sword at times.
Finally, Naruto is often geared towards younger viewers. Yes, those little midgets everyone ignores on internet forums and discussion boards (lovingly referred to as &quot;Narutards&quot;) are probably the greatest reason why Naruto has gained such popularity.
This review was hastily manufactured at 3:12am.
Please excuse any lapses in grammar, spelling, and sanity I may have had in writing this review.",7
"
                I remember back when i first saw naruto. I thought he a was a pliot. How offen do you make that mistake? What kind of ninja wears a orange jumpsuit? Also ninja are stealthy, they stick to the shadows and use swords and shuriken NOT some dragon ball z crap. Plus he's is a goku knockoff, 9 tails, super sayian anyone? If sasuke wants to leave, let him, don't make a whole 2 or 3 seasons of fillers that have nothing to do with anything. ""Curry of life"" REALLY!?

"
                I enjoyed this anime a lot when I was young. I found the
story line to be generally interesting and motivated me to
continue watching.
Now that I'm older I know Naruto wasn't a good anime.
Story progression was long and destination was set years
in the future.
The characters were unique and differed drastically from
each other. Each character has their own story whichgives the anime some pros.
Unfortunately I weigh story more than anything else. The story doesn't end, it continues into Shippuden. If the story wasn't as slow progressing and random then the anime
would be better.",3
"
                   Well, you've got to admit Naruto is one of the most popular anime in the world, also because it's also aired in the US. However, popularity does not represent everything. Naruto, definitely was very ideal and imaginative with these super ninjas. 
   The three main characters, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura, all had a close relationship for they have been in a team for most of their time. Naruto and Sasuke, who were supposedly natural rivals, fought their best to compete each other and tease about the others' loss. By the time this arch enemy Orochimaru comes, this anime changes its
                  environment.
For the whole entire time, Sasuke leaves with Orochimaru, and therefore Naruto and Sakura tries their best to regain their lost friend. They all realize missing a friend could be fairly drastic towards everyday life. They tend to become stronger and fight with devilish opponents to move on and retrieve Sasuke. However, on the other hand, Sasuke refuses and once tried to kill Naruto because he had another objective in mind. Then, what kind of anime is this? Naruto and Sakura wants Sasuke back; they need him to be happy and believe that would do best for him. On the other hand, Sasuke refuses and fights back because he doesn't feel happiness in between their friendship. He wants to kill his brother who destroyed his clan. In the future, &quot;if&quot; Naruto ever caught Sasuke, what would they even do? Put him in a cage and lock him so that he won't escape? That's totally ironic! They want him back, but they know he's become all crazy, so they don't know what to do, but to seriously injure him so that he won't go back to his evil scheme. Is that even true friendship?
   The music is definitely great, for it gives different types of ideas. The music provides the thought of living in a peaceful village and swaying through history. One certain types of music from Naruto, it gives the idea of exciting actions full of thrill. The sound produced in Naruto is indubitably original and unique.
   The part where I enjoyed Naruto the most would be the beginning, where all of the story tends to make sense. Yet, in the later episodes, the author seems to push on forcefully to draw random frustrating plots.",5

                I have to say this anime was a huge disappointment. I used to be the biggest naruto fan, I mean ninjas whats not to like right? Watching it as it came out a few years back, I can see why this anime has the ratings it does. So I am trying to be as unbiased as possible. First those who haven't seen should be aware of is that this anime has a LARGE amount of filler and by LARGE amount I mean a LARGE amount. It felt like the author stopped caring half way through.The story starts off awesome, however becomes very very weak the
                  only reason I'm giving it a 5 is for the action and a few touching moments. This anime by no means deserves anything above a 6-7 IF that. If you are looking for great story and action I would highly recommend One Piece. On a lighter note If you still think you're interested you should defiantly watch naruto for those few moments and amazing action.",5
"
                I first watched Naruto, by way of fansubs, when it had just come out and it was still only in the Japnese audience. I remember that I was instantly hooked after watching the first maybe five episodes and because of that continued to follow the series.
Basically, I can tell you that the story is pretty decent. At the beginning it takes some time for them to get to the true plot line which is Naruto's nine tail fox; however, the arcs before the real plot line present a basis for the main plot line. And, I can honestly say that while I was watching the
                  arcs like the &quot;wave country&quot; and etc etc, that it was quite entertaining and it was a &quot;page turner&quot;. 
Nonetheless, the entire story is a bit stereotypical, but it is enjoyable nevertheless. 
The whole story is action-packed w/ plenty of comedy.
The characters are a bit stereotypical as well. Naruto is the hero that people don't understand; Sasuke is the loner that nobody can understand. However, this is not a problem as the way they present them seem to be original in itself. 
Well, overall I could write a lot more about this series, but if me to get to the point then here it is.
The fillers killed this series, like no other. I think that there are actually more fillers in Naruto then there is real episodes. 
Therefore, what should you do to remedy this fact?
You should just skip all fillers and head straight to the main plot because the main plot is something that is quite interesting and entertaining, while the fillers are just plain horrible and bad. 
Believe me, I tried to watch some of them and the fillers of Naruto were extrememly boring and had no originality whatsoever. 
Anyways watch this series, I'm sure you will like it, but skip all the fillers because it will just screw the show up for you.",7
"
                For some reason loads of people like this anime, I really do not get that. I watched the show until a certain villain (do not want to spoil it for others, just because I am civil) died, because the villain was the most interesting character. I mean:
Naruto.
Uninteresting character with the""a super powerful creature is inside you"" cliche (seen it in yu yu hakusho, bleach ans a ton of other shows). What does he want to be? A ninja... That is the begin motivation and then I wonder ""how do I connect to this character?"". Then the failed attempts to make him funny make him annoying,
                  his power is not that interesting and then I did some research and it will only become worse.
Sakura.
What is there to say about her? did she do anything in the first 2 seasons? well... she jumped before an old man to protect him with a kunai... and failed to do so. And that is all my faulty memory remembers about her.
Sasuke.
Somehow he is the beef cake bad boy personage, that got girls in real life swooning over him, I really do not get you people... He is bland and monotone, but hey at least he does things!
Fights.
Nothing that we have not seen being done better in older anime (yu yu hakusho for example, hell even dragonball and flame of recca were better in fight scenes). Big weapons are being used (what use is a shurken if it is foldable and has a diameter of one meter?) mostly and when they use their kunai their utterly useless. Then they use their ninja magic to fight, sasuke mostly breathes fire, naruto copies himself and sakura does nothing.
No real tension in this anime from what I have seen and does not really motivates me to look further (and I watched some horrible anime, willingly (though they're not on my list because they are quite obscure and I forgot their names...)).
Premise.
Ninja ninja ninja ninja, ninja ninja, believe it! Even though they are not ninja's since they do not use any stealth, I can forgive them calling themselves ninja's, the problem is that they keep putting attention to it! WE GET IT YOU ARE A NINJA AND NO I WILL NOT BELIEVE IT! STOP SAYING THAT! And Naruto has some kind of 9 tailed rabbit thing that says it is a fox sealed inside him for a reason and there are people with very unusual weapons that would not be that good in our world, but hey suspension of disbelieve, eh?
Overall.
Not a pleasant anime and I find it a wonder that the show lasted this long in manga form...",4

                naruto is my favourit anime ever and easily the greatest anime of all time. it made ninjas super awesome and its way better than dumb anime like elfen lied!!! seriosly elfen lied sucks, the characters are boring unlike everyon in naruto. naruto has awesome fun characters like naruto himself who is a awsome main character and colorful. also everythin about naruto is great, so i gave story, art, sound, character, and enjoyment a 10/10 for this anime so everyone should know how good it is!!! go watch it now if u havent

                -The fans are waiting for the plot to continue, we need to delay it. We will need fillers, lots of fillers.
-Hundrends of fillers...
-But my lord, there is no such force...
""doors open to reveal a sea of fillers""
-This night... You will feast on the patience of fans!!!!
""But Bleach had a lot of fillers! And you gave it a perfect 10!!! You hypocrite!"" Yes, but Bleach had filler ARCS! Consistent, well directed, logically lengthed, ARCS! And gradually improving ones too. The Nozomi Arc (the last one) was in fact as good as the main story if not better. Naruto on the other hand has one-shot episodes. AWFULLY
                  written, one-episode fillers that add nothing to the story and are in fact a real pain to watch. Also, Bleach didn't interrupt the main story more than the number of Filler Arcs. Naruto on the other hand usually throws one main story episode and follows it with a filler one. This is unbelievably annoying, as you feel the story keeps getting interrupted by fillers. CONSTANTLY. 
Main story episodes concerned, Naruto offers amazing battles (especially the exam episodes at the start of the series were AWESOME) that leave you really impressed. The rules of combat are well explained (moves cannot be repeated indefinitely, every skill has a weakness, people get tired, etc etc) and the music makes the fights all the better (keep in mind that the length of the fights is pretty good). Character designs are also very distinctive, so that, like bleach, you will remember almost everyone (and unlike One Piece I might add).
A problem that appears halfway through the anime and starts appearing waaaayyy too often later on, is the obsession of the mangaka with ""history repeating itself"". The first time this became evident it was quite cool, as you didn't expect such a good ideology from the script. The second time you still liked it but a bit less. The third time you just patiently waited for the anime to get over with it. AFTER 100 TIMES IT'S REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF. Every team in existance is composed of 2 men and one woman. One of the men is quite serious and cool, the other is a fool that constantly draws attention to himself by acting stupid, but is in truth the big-hearted one. EVERY, F$%KING, TEAM. Calling the plot ""repetitive"" would be the understatement of the year. 
Another thing that quickly becomes annoying, especially in Shippuden, is how the show constantly throws at us that Naruto had a rough, unfair childhood. Again, the first time it was a very welcome addition to the anime, showing how far Naruto has come to be respected by his peers. But when it's done in every single episode you really start hating it. No more flashbacks please! I don't care how much money you save with the animators! Get on with the plot! 
If the above weren't enough out of the three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura) Naruto is a complete idiot, Sasuke can't decide between being emo, an avenger or Itachi's little brother and Sakura keeps pursuing the same guy for about... The whole anime + Shippuden. Not the most inspiring of leads to be sure. In fact if it wasn't for the awesome battle music I'm pretty sure Naruto would be hated by everyone. (Oh and for the record: I absolutely hate Jiraya as a character, there I said it!)
Find an episodes list that doesn't include the fillers and go watch it, for the battles alone it is totally worth it.",7
"
                Many people out there love Naruto and I can see why. The characters are compelling, varied and interesting and the storytelling has many parts that are likable. But there are three big problems that drags everything down. Here they are.
1: No-one ever changes
This is mostly true for Naruto, but also for other characters and situations. It seems that the more important the character is, the less the character develops. The only development you see is an increase in abilities and power, but with such a cast of characters so much more could have been done. Thusly, Naruto is a show of wasted opportunities and weak
                  character development.
2: Very slow pace
There are large parts of the show where the last part of the previous episode makes up the first part of the following! Seriously! This means that during that time you will LITERALLY not miss a single frame of animation if you skip every second episode. Also, some battles are so drawn out that you almost expect the participants to drop dead from old age, or at least hunger. Picking up the pace at most places would have helped the show immensely.
3: Fillers
The dreaded fillers, episodes that do not follow the main storyline but show adventures apart from it. They have been handled well in many shows, but in Naruto it seems that almost every filler was written by someone who doesn't like writing stories. There are a few gems to be had, but for the most part they're boring and irrelevant. Fillers can help develop the characters, but this just doesn't happen in Naruto.
In conclusion, Naruto can be very good and very enjoyable at times, but finding those gems means watching a whole lot of boring and repetitive stuff. A shortened version with only the good parts included would make it a much better series.",5
"
                Besides having a cool theme/platform, Naruto doesn't have too much to offer.
Even though this anime is ridiculously comical and annoying at times(due to over-exposition) it also has a very likable story. Naruto didn't exactly play it safe with all of its hidden secrets the story is based around, secrets that are completely shielded hundreds of episodes into the series. Its clear that what still keeps Naruto shining as a story is its characters, say what you want but Naruto is definitely considered to be the most recognized anime ever--and the general story isn't exactly a masterpiece. 
So, about those characters: Am I implying that without
                  them being exactly how they are Naruto would've failed? NO. The idea of such a sad upbringing leading up to these characters is what makes them so much more special. In the first episodes of Naruto you're getting a glimpse of what Narutos entire childhood has been like, and before you know it things are lookin' up! This makes you feel personally attached to Naruto or at the very least makes you appreciate how much you get to see Naruto progress throughout the show(which, is what the show is solely about for the most part).
The main problem people have with Naruto is; it's 'mainstream' or 'too hyped', both of which are formed from peer pressure basically. Mainstream is not a bad thing, it just means they're giving people what they know they want. As long as it's still enjoyable who cares? And as for the hype, all I have to say is: Nothing great(whether positive or negative) goes without hype, does hype change anything though? Hype always comes with a reason. Example: R*pe. 
Lastly I'd just like to say, MOST ANIMES AREN'T MEANT TO BE PERFECT--JUST ENJOYABLE. I've seent many animes and I like all types - can't you stop trying to be a critic and just try to enjoy it? I did and its only made me happier, so why not? 
- Thanks.",8

                Yeah, Ninjas are the pretty cool. The best thing to happen to history. But, what the f*** is Naruto?!?! What Ninja do you know that goes up to you and announces that there a ninja? That doesn't tip anybody off?? Like what the Munch. I don't know what to say. (okay yes I do) And don't ninjas wear all black and only work in the night so they don't fall into enemy hands??? And ok... Naruto kind of gets it, he's wearing a jump suit... BUT WHY IS IT ORANGE?! Then, there's the girls in Naruto! why is... sukura a ho? Why is Hinata and
                  Neji the only people making some kind of sense out of the whole seris? Okay, Im going to stop, all I got to say is Naruto's dumb. =P",2

                this anime was the base for my metaphorical anime cake so to speak. the story is great following a boy , naruto, on his quest to become the greatest ninja in the village known as hokage in the region of fire throughout the story naruto has many battle all of them are very signifacant because of his determination to become hokage. it has amazing storyline as i have just described and all characters have they're distinctive characteristics.

                Listen listen listen. You need to know that I'm reviewing this based on the canon parts of Naruto. The reason it's probably rated so low on average on MAL is because of the amount of filler that's in it. If I was taking all that into account, I'd probably more likely rate this series an 8 instead of a 10. 
However, since I'm not going to do that, please let me tell you why Naruto is one of the best anime to be made. The story in its barest form isn't all that original, right? It's typical Shounen, so I can't really vouch for the
                  astounding, original plot. However, I can and will brag on the story that was told through this anime. Before I do that, though, I will point out that the pacing of the plot does sort of ignore unnecessary things. It may feel to you that's it's moving a bit swiftly because there isn't a whole lot of buffer between arcs, and the arcs don't waste any time getting to their main point. 
That being said, I absolutely love this coming-of-age story. I think it translates loneliness and childhood really nicely into a fantastical universe. Though, as I said, the pacing is a bit fast, the story itself blends really well to the point where you can't really tell the difference between where one arc ends and another begins. I can't brag on the details of the story too much because I don't want to give it away, but it makes you feel empowered, and though the bare plot isn't original at all, the way its told has multitudes of personality. 
On to the characters. I always say that great characters are necessary for a story to be good, and in fact, they can even carry a terrible story if they need to. Naruto has a brilliant story, but its characters are what make it so beautiful. For one thing, this anime isn't afraid to make every moment an important one for a specific character, and I like that because it means that we get to see these characters grow up and change in a realistic way. Also, the friendships that are created through the story really make it worth watching, if nothing else. The strong bonds that are formed are portrayed really well, and I think they're used well also. What I mean by that is these characters are written in such a way that they each affect each other at every point in the story. It's a cool way to depict friendship. 
I'm very bad at reviews, but let me leave you with this at least: watch this anime. If you need to skip the fillers to enjoy it, do it, but the main story is so worth it. The voice actors are amazing, it's brilliantly funny, and it'll touch your heart in a way nothing else has. It's a classic for a reason, I really don't think you'll find anything quite like this anywhere else.
And, if nothing else, I hear the sequel series is way better, so you may as well watch this and then have a good time with that. I'm sure going to. Thanks for reading!",10
"
                I used to like this series.
I used to enjoy it.
Not anymore.
This series does not age well.  I found the apex of the series to be the Chunnin Exams and the very moment that Naruto decks out Gaara was probably one of the better moments showing the differences between the two.  
But now, looking back....it wasn't worth the time.Some of my favorite series have less episodes to work with and tell more interesting stories.  
Some of my favorite series have less plot, but are a lot more enjoyable.
And some of my favorite series run less than the amount of filler episodes in this series.  
Overall, I lost interest.  I still like a couple of the characters.  But I've outgrown the series.  
Naruto himself as a character stopped being interesting and was turning into the whinny little kid type I found throughout the series.  Sakura is just useless and Sasuke reminds me of a slow and way dialed up emo Hiei from Yu Yu Hakusho.  
This series is a cash cow, it was fun at the time, but now it's run it's course and doesn't age well.
A lot of the series development is either pointless or easy to see from miles ahead.  
It's easy to see why kids from 10-17 like it. But I'm 23 and outgrew that trend.
There are better series out there.  Pass on this if you haven't watched it.",3
"
                Hmm... I got bored and decided to write this. Also, pardon the fact i might have no T's or more than one. My key is broken.
anyway, Naruto is a hit or miss show. You either love or you hate it. I have yet to finish it, yes, [it's on hold >>] but despite that, I have been attempting to keep up with the manga.
Story: Kind of cliche, run on, and weird. but it keeps you coming back for more. Which is what good anime/manga are supposed to do.
Art: Not the best by far. It's decent at parts but at others, the characters tend to have
                  ""Derp"" faces, or noodle arms. There are parts, however, where the animation is almost flawless.
Sound: Narutos voice will annoy the hell out of you at first.. It will, but you'll get used to it. Same with everyone else's. The openings and endings are usually very well chosen, and the music used gives the right amount of emotion.
Character: You'll love them or hate them. Just like every character. But they do go through some changes that make them better.
Enjoyment: can't really say i enjoyed this. i loved it, i hated it. it frustrated me -- still does -- but it had the right amount of emotion.
Overall: it's a cute little series that i will probably rewatch. i'll most likely always have a softspot for the little blond idiot.",7

                i just lost my time. a ridicullous story with 100 fillers and bothersome stuff that lead to nowhere. the characters are all cliche none original, besides 75% off naruto is copied from other good anime such as dragonball, trigun and MANY others (if u have watched it and havent noticed u r an ignorant person with low anime culture). in the end i can just say: naruto is something for ppl not otaku, and under 12. for the naruto fans i just think u should watch something good.

                If you have a friend, or better yet a group of em', always criticising your anime indulging existence. Fret not, convert them. Throw this at their faces and if all goes well (it did, for me) theyll be begging you for more.
A boy that is destined to be hated for life, alone and sad forever. Naruto shows that no matter what kind of society that you in and no matter what is thrown against you, you are the key that makes it better for yourself. Written down in a world where ninjas and inner spirit power (Chakra) takes place, it opens up a new way
                  of how we or should i say, i, look at ninjas.
Forbidden techniques, country-colonizing, 3 man teams. You wont know what ninjas really do after you watch this. Sadly, to me it kind of lost a great deal of fans. A year long series-killer, fillers. Yes. It started off to be quite entertaining but before long, the episodes were like aired as though it was just to keep it going while the manga side runs on.
Then, life breathes back into the series it when it was announced that the original manga published stories were set to be aired as a second part of naruto with a timeskip, featuring a grown up naruto's generation and apparently new quality of episodes. Check for Naruto: Shippuuden.",9
"
                Well I have to say I was dissaponted in this anime a bit. Its very over exaggerated. Well the characters are much too simple and lack depth. Though they are comical which could be a decent aspect. Characters here tend to tug at my tolerance. They dont feel relateable. I dont feel that connection between character and audience. Honestly the main character{Naruto} just seems to piss and moan. Theres too many fillers and fights drag on for episodes. The art is bearable. But the plot isnt too complex either and theres almost no plot twists. For older audieneces, I feel this is more like a
                  waste of time. That audienece have tendency to enjoymore thought provoking shows. As for a younger auidence I think this might be enjoyable.",3

NK: You found Ultimate Ninja, didn't you?
Ak: Yep!  Hey, why'd you stop watching Naruto, anyway?
NK: Well, I was reading the manga at the same time, and I got tired of all the filler episodes.  Of course, I didn't read all of it, either.  Stopped shortly after the Shippuden switch.
Ak: Oh...why'd you start watching it?
NK: Because it had ninja in it.  Why wouldn't I start watching it?

NK: Not much anymore.  I used to be obsessed with ninja, though.

NK: Still?  A little bit.  It had some funny moments, and some of the characters weren't half bad.
Ak: Like who?
NK: Hinata and Kiba were a couple of my favorites when I watched it, and I still like Kakashi.
Ak: How come?
NK: He's such a serious leader in tight spots, but he has a good sense of humor, as well.
Ak: Even though there was a lotta filler, did you still like the story?
NK: Yeah, it was pretty interesting.
Ak: Any part you liked best?
NK: The Chuunin Exam was my favorite arc, especially the individual fights.  Those were really well animated.
Ak: Any scene in particular?
NK: Hmm...my favorite scene was actually before the Chuunin Exam.  It was the Water Dragon Jutsu clash between Kakashi and Zabuza.  I used to have the hand seals memorized for that.
Ak: Wow!
NK: Just wasted time, really.
Ak: So, you're not gonna watch the rest?
NK: Nope.  The story got really complicated even without the filler, plus there's only so much bad voice acting one can take.
Ak: You think others should watch it?
NK: It's a good beginner anime that covers all different types of characters, so those who don't know much about anime could start with Naruto.  I wouldn't recommend watching the entire series, though.

                Naruto was one of my first anime that I just found randomly on TV. After that I watched like first 35 episodes and then they stopped it...
I really liked Sasuke and Naruto, and even then Sakura was useless at least I though so.
What got me into it? It probably has to be the idea of ninjas, wars and mostly Naruto's and Sasuke's back story.
The idea of a fox that was sealed inside a little boy was mind blowing to me. And that everyone hated him, because of it kinda reminded me where I was at the time.
The openings was really good as well, but
                  there was some openings that I didn't really enjoyed as much as others.
Watching this anime was a great experience, because after they stopped airing it on TV I remembered about it after 2 yrs ago and then got really into it...
Naruto thought me one thing: It's to never give up, no matter how bad it looks.",7
"
                Warning: Might be spoilers, not like &quot;oh naruto kills 'name', but like &quot;at this time it was sad&quot;.
Well, first off, yeah this was the first Anime I saw, hence I loved it, but that ended quite horridly some episodes after episode 80, when it started falling, and I mean FALLING from grace, it fell so hard I nearly cried. It started out as a great anime but turned out to be some repetitive piece of crap.(Spoiler) I must say that no anime has had me as close to crying as this one from the things that happened around the Zabuza time(Spoiler). So my advice is
                  to only watch up to about 80. 
(Only for those who have seen it all) :
What pissed me the most of is when they repeat the EXACT thing that happened around the Zabuza time with that other 'sword dude' who has two swords instead of the gigantic Zabuza one. Everything is the same, just with different skills and abilities.",1
"
                Ok, first things first. Im a girl. I'm more of a shoujo person. And at first I thought Naruto was stupid. I like animes like Ouran High school or Fruits Basket, But even if you are like me and you don't like action, let me tell you this: YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!!! After watching the first ten episodes I fell in love with it. And in a month, I'm already done with the first season of Naruto (220 episodes) and now waiting for the 336th episode of Naruto Shippuuden to be released. 
The art isn't bad, and I just love the characters. Naruto is
                  really really funny, you have to make sure you go take a piss before you watch an episode. I may make it sound very calm, but the author did a really really good job at blending blood, fighting, comedy, and a tiny bit of love in it. There are a lot of morals, like ""never give up"". It's not too confusing to understand all the concepts of the shinobi. I really really enjoyed the story and the characters. A MUST WATCH FOR GUYS AND GIRLS EVEN!!! Well, maybe I'm overrating it a bit, but this is one of the best, funniest, most actiony animes out there!",10
"
                Oh my. Naruto. I almost shed a tear when rated it so low, because i wanted it to be any better than what it has become.
Naruto is for me on of the best anime out there if you only count from episode ONE to NINETY NINE. It has commedy, no romance, action and excelent fights and a great character development for the protagonist and perhaps other ""sub"" characters like gaara for instance.
The way naruto finds his way to release the ""hidden fox"" inside of him and the way naruto rivals with sasuke who would later become his best friend and enemy is superb.
In the beggining
                  he is much of a wuss, but he gains strength little by little through tough training and lamen eating... (~datte ba yo ! ^^) and not through inconsistents powerupps !!!
=== BUT ===
After episode 99, there're fillers and the story starts to get slowed down so much that one episode would contain half of the last episode in the form of flashbacks and the other half being flashbacks of earlier parts of the SAME EPISODE... until it gets to a point where you would get FULL SEASONS OF FILLERS and the anime starts to get UNWATCHABLE.
But people tend to forget/ignore this move and that's why he is just another OVERATED series here in anime list.
So if you rate naruto for only his 99 first episodes (10+++) but as a whole series with 220 episodes in total (3~) we get about 45% of the anime being very good and the whole rest not. 
Naruto still managed to have a sequence as bad (or worst) than its fillers, called Naruto ShiFillerDen...
Just to finish it, the protagonist has his own name as the title of the series, wich means we can't expect that he will ever die. xD",3
"
                Fun fact: This anime, along with Lucky Star, made me quit anime for quite a few years. Which is a shame, because anime is a very diverse artistic medium. Unfortunately, I made the fallacious assumption that all anime was as dreadful and tedious as Naruto.
I think the saddest thing about Naruto is the wasted potential. Just think about it-- groups of ninjas fighting each other-- how cool is that? Unfortunately, Naruto doesn't meet this standard of awesomeness in a variety of ways.
**Story** - 3 (Poor)
The story really had great potential, but it got mind-numbingly awful really quickly. Countless filler episodes (it seems as if the
                  majority of episodes are filler) destroy the story even more. Most of the ""plot twists"" (if you can call it that) are extremely convoluted and contrived beyond belief (ex., Orochimaru coming back to life countless times for no particular reason just to ""shake up"" the story). Without going into specifics about the story, it didn't particularly do much for me, as it was kind of like: go from point A to point B, then fight, wash, rinse, repeat. I can't go without mentioning the sheer LENGTH of this anime. This actually leads even further to its downfall. I don't particularly mind longer series, but when your anime is 220 fucking episodes long for no particular reason, with half of it being filler, you've got yourself a problem: Who wants to watch 220 dragged out episodes, only about 1/10 of that being ACTUAL ACTION. Half the episodes aren't relevant to the plot, so I SUPPOSE you could skip those, but I don't really like to skip episodes in a series for some reason. Making Naruto even more infuriating for me to watch. /rant over/
**Art** 6 (Fair)
Eh, I'm not a stickler for art, so I don't particularly care. Not the most gorgeous art ever, but it'll do, I suppose.
**Sound** 3 (Poor)
Again, not really a stickler for music. I don't really care. If it has amazing music, that's another plus. But music isn't centric to the anime experience.
Now, you're probably asking: well then, why did you give it a 3? Two words: voice acting. Oh my god. Naruto's voice is extremely grating on my ears, and I want to kill myself whenever he says believe it!/dattebayo. It doesn't matter if you're watching sub or dub, Naruto's voice just makes you hate him.
**Character** 1 (Pathetic)
Pathetic is exactly the word I'd use to describe Naruto's characters. Naruto is a completely unlikeable main character, due to 1) his voice and 2) the fact that he's extremely fucking annoying and completely cliché-- super special child born with super special power out to save the world! Original Naruto, very original. It seems a huge flaw with the characters of Naruto is that they're completely one dimensional-- they have exactly one facet to their personality. For example:
Naruto- never gives up
Sasuke- broody emo guy
Sakura- completely fucking useless
Jiraiya- complete pervert
You get the idea. There *are* some interesting characters that I actually liked, such as Haku and Zabuza. Unfortunately, they aren't around for long and are quickly forgotten, being pretty much pointless to the main story.
**Enjoyment** 2 (Dreadful)
What can I say? Convoluted and contrived story, too long, too boring, too many fillers, horrible characters, annoying voice acting, one-dimensional characters. Gah.
**Overall** 2 (Dreadful)
Just no. Please, skip Naruto. Just please don't even go there. I hate this series due to the reasons above. I realize I'll probably get flamed to death by Naruto fans, but meh…",2

                Well, well here's Naruto. Oh joy. OK before I start reviewing this I would like to point out that this is a review and therefore it will contain the personal opinions of the person in cause, me. What was the point of me saying that, one may wonder? Well, simply put, it's due to the fact I'm well aware of Naruto's huge popularity and therefore I'm certain a lot of people that will read this review will, probably, find themselves frustrated of what will they consider of me being completely devoid of any taste in anime for not realizing the geniousness of this anime. Now
                  with that outta the way let's head on the review. What's most important for any anime? Of course the story. I'll be direct and say that the story , in my case, is nothing short of dreadful, and therefore get's the 2 thumbs up from me. It's based around a kid, who so happens to have lost his parents, and therefore is an orphan, and the challenges he'll face in his quest to become the greatest ninja in his village, which is called Hokage by the way. Seems simple but yet intriguing now doesn't it. Well so have I though till I actually gave it a watch. To my surprise the story falls flat on it's face from the very first episodes. This is mostly due to the story itselfs being in contradiction with the world in which it develops or maybe the other way 'round. The plot device here is the ninja world. However in Naruto's world, the ninjas seems to be the inverted version. Where a ninja has to be stealthy and calculated, here most ofem shout, scream, jump head-on in a confrontation and apparently don't even bother wearing proper uniform, something to help disguese them, instead prefering to walk around in  bright colors so that everyone may notice them. Art get's a 5. All I can say bout it is that it was good but overuse of recycled scenes made it eem cheap and there less enjoyable to watch as the series progressed. Sound get's the 6. It's great that's for sure but unfortunately it suffers from the same problem  as the art of the show. As the series progressed the soundtracks ued got cut down untill eventually they ended up recycling 4-5 more memorable soundtracks for every episode that followed while the others went into complete obscurity. Character. Oh boy. 1. I really feel sorry for their characters. Aside from the main characters the rest are underdeveloped and bland, and some go as far as succumbling to certain stereotypes. Example: A fat guy in one group that thinks alwys 'bout food, eats all the time, and oh wait he can also use a technique which makes him even fatter. Yeah, if that's the idea of a character of a comedic value than to Naruto's misfortune it's long overdue. And ther re lots more. Smart kid who is too smart to even bother, kid who ties to win his crush over by standing up to the guy who seems to popular, guy too popular but who doesn't care about anything etc. And the list could go on. To underdevelop a character is one thing but to completely throw out the window the ntion of balance between is completely another. And again, while this is bad, Naruto seems to excel at this. Main characters get stronger by learning new powers while old ones are stuck with the very powers they started with and as the enemies appearing get stronger  and stronger the only thing these side characters end up showing is how useless they've become or are becoming. And the main character is also a reason the whole show falls. His annoying and completely unlikeble. Ok Naruto we get it that you're an orphan and despite that you have the guts to stand up to the injustice that life's done you and pursue your dreams but that isn't a reason to keep remnding us this every episode. And also the sheer amount of positivity in this guy in contrast with how he behaves is something that is completely unrealistic. The choice in doing such a character also limits his development possibilities which in turn diminishes the viewers interste in even following this character. He's not worth it. You already know he has a strong belief in the morale values he upholds and , therefore, regardless of watever challenges he faces he'll always pull it off 'cuz of his strong beliefs. But his constant reminder of this aspect of him really makes unlikeble due to the fact that after a while it gets anoying and can't help but give a weird sensation that the show is just trying to scold you and shove it's morale lessons down your throat. With this said I can only state that I hardly enjoyed Naruto and to put it in a nutshell, it gets a 3 on the Enjoyment meeter but that's only due to moments of amusement from how ridiculous this whole show is and of how hard it tries to be serious. Overall I give it a 2. The art and sound doesn't save the show from me giving it a 2 due to the fact that, as well as they might be, the whole experience is poor. Final score for Naruto: 2",2
"
                Naruto, Naruto, Naruto.
This show gets a lot of hate and a lot of praise; rarely anything in between. I can understand both sides, if we're being honest here. This show is WAY overhyped, I will admit. Do I hate it? No. Do I love it? Almost ashamed to admit it.
I think this show was the first show I actually watched the American premier and stuck with it after all these years. At first, I preferred the American version to the Japanese because I hated reading subtitles, but now I prefer the Japanese, only because some characters' voices are ""slightly"" less irritating. But both are fine.
                  
Character-wise: Wow, where to begin? The characters in this show are ridiculously dramatic: tragic pasts, bad choices because of them, familial issues, blah blah blah. But despite their bitter attitudes, the main character, Uzumaki Naruto, somehow manages to change people's points of view almost every time without fail with his famous ""speeches"". Now I, personally, have never been in a fight, but I'm not sure any super villains will just stand around and watch you make a speech while wallowing in your own self-pity. Everyone eventually becomes obsessed with Naruto and after all those years of Naruto wishing everyone would like him, he ends up not giving a flying *$&^! Wanna know why? Uchiha Sasuke.
Plot-wise: Yikes, Masashi Kishimoto, what have you done to Naruto? To your fans? To yourself? I think Kishimoto has enough plot holes to use as graves for every single Naruto character ever. But do fans turn the other cheek? Always. Why? Because we're so deep into this thing, why question anything now? Just shrug it off and wait for the next eye-roller he dishes out.
The worst thing about this show? You guessed it! FILLERS ON FILLERS ON FILLERS ON FILLERS ON... Well, you get it. Need I say more?
Yes, I'm bashing the ever-living daylight out of this show, but as I said before, I don't hate it. To be honest, I'll always hold a special place in my heart for Naruto. Yeah, yeah, corny, I know. Would I recommend it? I'd be too ashamed to. I'd tell you to run the other way immediately before you get sucked it.
And still, I rate it a 7. I've been with it from the beginning and I saw it through the end.",7
"
                Ignoring the filler: Naruto is an amazing series.
Naruto has a plot that pulls you in, sometimes you have no idea how a fight between 2 people will turn out until the last 30 seconds, sometimes not until the fight has finished. Almost every character in the whole series gets character development and you learn to love everyone for either being: cool, strong, confident or because of how evil they are. 
You have to watch Naruto before Shippuden. Otherwise you are joining a story right in the middle and nothing will make much sense. The filler can be annoying and it is all not worth watching,
                  you could always come back to it after you have finished the series but first time watchers, I recommend skipping them. I mean come on, they animated the whole story of Part I in the manga up until the very last chapter, then they put 84 filler episodes in a row before animating the final chapter of Part I. 
Also, don't read the summary for Shippuden until you've finished the original series, I'm so glad that I did not because it completely gives away the ending of original Naruto and will affect how you see characters the first time watching it.
If you would like a filler guide and to enjoy the series to its maximum without ruining it with pointless, bland filler, watch these episodes only:
1-25
27-96
98-100
101 is filler but based off of a canon omake (short story). It is funny and the only filler I recommend watching.
107-135
Then the last 11/12 minutes of episode 220. You should know when the canon starts because they replay the final canon scene from episode 135.
I hope that people give Naruto a chance and watch it they way you're supposed to, without filler.",9
"
                There are few shows that I can watch without wanting to turn off the TV at least once. Everyone show has it's point where it just gets a little silly. However, Naruto is one of the few shows, minus the endless filler at the end, that I just can't stop watching. 
I first watched Naruto after enjoying plenty of other great anime series and I was still surprised at how awesome it is. It does have some cliches but everything does at this point. What makes it stand out is the characters and a really interesting plot line. IMO, you cannot do wrong watching this
                  show. It's one of the best!",10
"
                Earlier I wrote a review on Naruto, but I deleted it because I felt I didn't go into much detail, now I will review Naruto in broader detail than before. 
Masashi Kishimoto is one of the many artists to be inspired by highly popular manga/anime series Dragon Ball, like the other two of the ""Big Three""; Bleach and One Piece. Dragon Ball is one of the most influental anime series ever created, a story of a boy named Son Goku who wants to be strong and be there for his friends while defeating the baddies with peserverance, courage,& a sufficent amount of training, simple yet
                  incredibly groundbreak. So here, I'll compare Naruto to Dragon Ball.
Story- Naruto follows a very similar formula of those of Dragon Ball Z(as well the same pacing), though one thing should be known, the concept isn't very original: ""A pucky, young boy who longs to become the best ninja there is by becoming the next Hokage, & doing their job better than they've ever dreamed to"". That concept has been used so many times on a Shonen, so Naruto is another coming-of-age anime,& the biggest question, does it deliever? You bet, it may not be too out-of-the-box or defining, but it does give us good settings,& nice built-up though it has many pointless flashbacks, it balances in the themes of friendship, trust, batrial, vengenase,& never giving up very well, like the way Team 7 worked together and truimphed through their missions was something to behold.....but all that takes a backseat after Sasuke disbands from the squad and the series no longer feels like the very entertaining coming-of-age series we used to know but became more like a shallow and boring sob-story. 
Art and Animation- Nothing to brag about here, the character designs are poorly-drawn, have poor palleting, there's so many errors(but hey, atleast Naruto looks cool),& they're very generic, but it's quite different for the manga as it looks infinitly better,& back on topic: The animation is very choppy, one moment it's fluid but in another it's cheap(compare Naruto vs. Kiba(cheap) to Lee vs. Gaara(fluid)) , it's not the same to say for Dragon Ball as it was well-animated for it's time period although some scenes in there looked cheap. The Opening and Ending sequences look fantastic though.
Sound- Top-notch here, top-notch. The voice-actings fit the character's personality very well, DUB AND SUB, but one character's voice-actor I'd like to complain about and that's Sasuke's, the guys who voice him are atleast in their 30's, when Sasuke is 12-years old, Junko Takeuchi(who voices Naruto Uzumaki in the Japanese version ) might have been more fitting for his 12-year old body than Noriaki Sugiyama,& the dialogue is unnatural at times. Othere than that, I applaud the performance. As for the soundtrack, it's one of the best I've ever heard in an anime, they enhance the events,& really fit the atmosphere of the show, really worthy of importing. This is one category Naruto handles better than Dragon Ball. 
Characters- Well not being as likable or well-defined as Dragon Ball characters, they are still very-well developed(for the most parts), the characterization is handled much like Dragon Ball as they grow physically and mentally. Though a lot of people find them annoying, I don't mind most of them really but I don't agree they're one of the deepest and most well-characterized. One character I feel is complete waste and shouldn't be around is Sakura Haruno, she's the Krillin of Naruto but not as memorial, although she does vouch to be more helpful but she does not fullfill that prophecy untill Shippuden,& she's generally extremely annoying,& she's unbearable to look at. The characters are your typical Shonen archetypes: Naruto is the hyper-active kid yearning to be the best of the best, Sasuke is a rival of Naruto,& Sakura....she's a b!tch and doesn't do much more than lust for the rival. 
Enjoyable- I'm not gonna lie, I really did enjoy this series, granted it's not even close to being one of the best animes out there, I don't think it's even a candidant for it. The first 100 or so episode are amazing, it has amazing fight choreography, atlmost on par with what you've seen with DBZ, but the rest...not so much, that's where all the fun stops, I'll admit the comedy filler episodes were a breath of fresh air but still.
Positives:
+ Decent story 
+ Stunning Opening and Ending Sequences
+ Top-notch voice-acting
+ Top-notch music
+ Well-defined Characters
+ Easy to get into
+ Cool Fight Scenes
Negatives:
- Overall weak Art and Animation
- Not original
- Filler Episodes
- Overabundant Flash-back scenes
- Sakura Haruno
Final Verdict:
Without the filler episodes, it may have gotten an 8 or 9, but the series is perfect if you wanna get into anime as it's not hard to follow. And if you like Shonens(primarly action-packed ones like DBZ and Yu Yu Hakusho), defintely watch it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. :)",7

                I watched Naruto when I was a kid, because there was nothing else on TV. So I had to basically do with what I had. I didn't particulary enjoy it at the time either because there were more interesting shows on air like the hilarious dub for Duel Masters which is one of my all-time favorites.
Naruto? Pfft, sure, the first, like 30 episodes are alright, up until the genin exam is over or whatever that shit was. And then Sasuke turns up the edge levels so high you could cut yourself if you touched the screen. The character development is an absolute joke and if
                  you actually have some taste you'd know that someone who spouts nonsense about growing stronger and whatever the fuck else while managing to be so incredibly annoying and without any redeeming values whatsoever except the fact that they are vaguely fascinating to look at when genderbent, cannot be a good lead character.
And you'd be right! Naruto is one of the, if not THE worst lead characters of all fucking time. A harem protagonist is more entertaining to watch than this bloke. It's obvious he's going to win every fight, it's obvious he's gonna train hard and get better every time. It's painfully obvious whenever someone smiles off-cam that something evil and spooky is gonna happen.
Now I know the general consensus about this load of trash, it got most people into anime(unfortunately) and also unfortunate is the fact that they didn't stop after Naruto, they went after other edgy shows like Tokyo Ghoul and whatever other miraculous trainwreck and made the scores skyrocket. The fandom is garbage for this show but that's not related to it's show itself, just tangentially.
You see, this show gathers all your pains and hardships from when you were an oppressed Eastern European infant with a fox in your guts and turns it into the most disgusting power trip you'll ever see, it's delusional, and suspension of disbelief only goes so far. Perhaps the delusional premise is what is most attractive when it comes to Naruto. Cause that shit just doesn't happen, ever, and if you're gonna be a smartass and tell me it's fiction, then tell the genius behind this series to make fiction credible within it's own described limits and not just plop a twist and jump the powerlevels by a googol every time he feels like it.
It's strangely entertaining to watch things fly on the screen but at that point you're basically okay with just about anything ranging from flies circling your lightbulb or Michael Bay. Naruto is basically the B-Movie of anime.
The budget for this is trash so the show looks as you might expect, the sound is, like, something to write home about in the sense that it's so boring you have to tell someone how boring it is. Terrible in fact, the music is trash too. Didn't have to be anything high-brow but damn they could've hired some better bands to perform instead of those garage party trash lid bangers that worked on this.
If you want a power-level heavy show that really does take its time to tell you how people got those powers, in detail, bit by bit. Wasting a good two episodes or three to show you how people die. Then go for DBZ.
If you just want a good shounen, a story about growing up and becoming stronger, with some real actual emotion. A Sasuke archetype that isn't completely shit. A god damn banging OP that will stay with you till your very last day. Then go with the king. YuYu Hakusho. That's my baby, that's my secret ingredient. If you feel the strange necessity to call this a good anime because you get nostalgic when you watch it, then do take in consideration the fact that you're basing it off the fact that you get nostalgic when you watch it, not because it's good. And it's true. Naruto is fucking garbage.",5
"
                Naruto....what everyone is always screaming about. Oh and don't forget this... &quot;Believe it!&quot; Well...the story's..ok is that it kinda gets repetitive and it gets off track, the art is aazing, you can practicly see every single detail in the background and on the bodys! The sound is also great because you can hear al the footsteps, rain drops, hitting and everything! the characters are...pretty bad cause thei're always like mutanta or someone that wants revenge or someone thats completely discombobulated or ANNOYING! (I'm looking at you Naruto) The enjoyment is also fair because like I said it gets repetetive and kinda boring but then suddenly
                  soething amazing happens and its always all talk and talk and talk an... *snore* So overall I would give it a 7. You should watch it but not be all obsessed in it.",7
"
                When this show started off I loved it. I loved every episode, the action was great, and it had some interesting story development. But then the show went on and as it went I spiraled down fast. Naruto himself got annoying, Sakura got frustratingly moany about Sauske, and Sauske turned out to be an arse. But the thing that really turned me off to the show fastest was the story line and how they were trying to get that laugh, and mostly just pandering to the age group that finds fart jokes funny. It got really irksome when an entire mission/story ark gets completely destroyed
                  when Naruto rips one (I'm looking at you Bikochu Beetle). The show still has some amazing fight sequences, and the overall concept shows that it could have been an amazing anime, if it had only decided to step out of the kiddy grades and not try to make us laugh at lame humor.",6
"
                At first, I thought it'll turn out to be a good anime since it was common. But, I was wrong.
The character development isn't as great, since Naruto starts as having a dream to become Hokage and goes through several missions and at the end of the series, what did it turn out to be? Having a dream of becoming Hokage once more. Meanwhile, Sasuke's dream is to kill someone that he's been willing to kill, and at the end what does he do? Search for the person to kill him. And it really does not make sense whatsoever. Ninjas are dreadful creatures of the hidden,
                  but I only watched this just to get more of a favor for ninjas and what do I get? More dislikes for ninjas. My ideal for ninjas was a positive manner until I watched all 220 episodes of this, praying and hoping for it to be at least positive. But I was wrong, there was no hope into continuing it to the second season. But, unlike my selfish self, I decided to. It was the worst decision in my entire life.
What I believe is that this anime isn't pointed directly to teenagers. It's pointed directly to little kids that haven't had a taste in good anime or cartoons yet. 
Character development was poor, story was filled with filters (so much that I got lost), art was decent due to the fighting scenes being all nice and stuff, but the drama in between it... It's annoying. The sound was decent, the enjoyment was alright. Reason being is: The only thing that I was enjoying out of this was my laughter. How funny it is to see someone else being more dramatic than my surroundings in reality. Making me reminiscent. If you're one of those people who takes anime seriously, then you'd probably crash with anger by the time you hit Episode 10-22.
It was a naive anime, but it isn't pointed directly towards the older audience.",3
"
                Naruto is one of the most famous and most popular animes of all time and it deserves the hype. The story takes place in a world where ninjas are very powerful and are a valuable and necessary government resource. The story centers around a young, ambitious, over-zealous boy named Naruto Uzumaki. Naruto dreams of becoming a very strong, formidable ninja and one day The Hokage (The leader of Naruto’s village. The Hokage must be, if not one of, the most powerful ninjas in the village). However Naruto is ostracized because of the fact that inside him is the nine-tailed fox spirit that was sealed inside
                  of him after it attacked the village and killed many ninjas around the time of Naruto’s birth.
Upsides
Naruto is one of the most famous and most popular animes of all time and it deserves the hype. Naruto is filled with many intense, dramatic battle scenes against enemy ninjas and has many likeable charismatic characters that you are guaranteed to fall in love with. Furthermore, Naruto has an always interesting, ever-changing storyline that goes far beyond fight scenes i.e., Naruto’s love/hate relationship with Sasuke who is a naturally gifted ninja that is always pushing Naruto to do better. Naruto and co. also offer a substantial amount of humour to go along with the stellar action and spectacular story.
Downsides
There aren’t many downsides to Naruto. That being said, there are some. One of the most prominent flaws being the slow pace, for example, the fist arc which really isn’t much more than an introduction to the main characters lasts about 15 episodes.
A big, but avoidable problem is the number of fillers. Alost 90 of the 220 episodes have no relevance to story are frankly, garbage. Luckily, thanks to the wonderful resource that is the internet, one can easily find which episodes are fillers and subsequently, skip them. But if you are a hard core Naruto fan and sitting through hours of episodes that have nothing to do with the story, there is nothing wrong with that.
At first glance, the young ages of most of the main characters may turn a few people away. It never actually states how old Naruto is but he appears to be about 10ish. But it really is irrelevant. Before long you will be indifferent to the ages of the kids.",9
"
                I first heard about this anime when I was at Hot Topic looking for cheap T shirts.  The scary man working there with big holes in his ears had a cool head band with a squiggle on it.  I thought it was neat and asked him about it.  After listening to him rant about how the show changed his life for about 20 minutes, immediately went home and started watching it.  At first I thought the show was for kids, but  then characters started dying and (spoiler alert) Sasuke left the village I cried for days.  The story is
                  great, the art is great (some of the best fight scenes I have ever seen in an anime), the sound is great, the enjoyment is great and the overall is great.  I try to tell my friends about it, but they usually just ignore me and just watch crappy shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones.  My friends don't really talk to me anymore, but i talk to lots of e friends on anime forums, so I'm better off anyways!  I LOVE THIS SHOW!",10
"
                I’m not ashamed to admit that I love Naruto. It is my favourite anime of all time and no matter how good the anime is that i watch in the future nothing can ever compare to the feeling of nostalgia i have towards this amazing show, Naruto was one of this first proper anime i ever watched and growing up watching the same characters grow and get stronger made me enjoy every episode even more.
Naruro is known as one of the ""Forbidden 4"" it is one of the biggest anime of all time and is still going to this day (as of making this review),
                  the only thing i can say is if you want to watch a anime with an amazing cast of characters a long running show that you can watch for hours on end with amazing fights and great story arcs then i highly recommend checking this show out then watching its successor Naruto Shippuden.
This review might seem a little biased and not very helpful but its hard to find anything wrong with a show you love so much, sure the animation might not be great anymore and there is alot of fillers but if you can look past that the story makes up for it, and at the end of the day great characters and an amazing story is more than enough to check this out in my opinion.",10
"
                Im not gonna tell you to watch this anime but let me just say Naruto one of the three OUTSTANDINGS 
The Three outstandings are
Naruto
Bleach
One Piece
Naruto is my favorite of the three because of Naruto himself his attitude and the cool Nine Tail fox moments make me get all hyped up saying bye bye enemy ninja ur screwed! naruto is the best anime i have ever watched 
I reccomend this anime 100% to all newcomers and veteran anime watchers
              ",10
"
                This was my gateway series. I had watched a lot of anime in the mid 90's but gave it up completely. I reluctantly started this series thanks to a persistent friend. This is the first part of the Naruto Manga (up until the time skip for his 2+ years of training). This is one of those anime that is difficult to turn off because it's just so good. This is yet another series that has established itself as a timeless classic right up there with Dragonball.
The violent world of the ninja in this series is filled with surprisingly rich characters. There is a lot of
                  comedy and a lot of drama. This series takes you through a full range of emotions, and the psychology of the battles that these 12 and 13 year old kids endure is amazing. The battles are clever and not necessarily done in real time so you can gain insight into how each character handles the situations move by move. The graphic and violent nature of this series makes it a crime that the english dubs target younger audiences. 
One of the biggest themes in this series is comradery. Naruto is an orphan that is hated by his village due to the incident surrounding his birth. He has to form bonds with others pretty much by overcoming one hardship after another. He earns his friendships through blood, sweat, and tears. The respect he gains is admirable, and he seems to do it while being a little slow on the uptake. The overall message remains heartwarming throughout. The message really is a good one.
If you must watch this series I advise picking up the ""uncut"" version. The last couple of seasons are almost 100% filler, so I do advise watching this filler free. The story from the Manga is adapted very well if you skip over the filler. I know some would argue that point with me, but it stays close to the Manga without filler, and the manga is a near masterpiece.",9
"
                Naruto is really typical, it seems like one of those infamous series you hear about all the time, so you tend to watch it to satisfy your own curiosity.  It's not as bad as some people claim, yet I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever watched.
Story: Here's the thing with the story of Naruto, it's really a good plot, it is, minus the fillers that is.  Once the fillers kick in, the whole enjoyment aspect of it just fully decreases.  I'm rating the story aspect of it based on the story itself, not the fillers, hence why I said it was
                  very good.  The rating for this anime would really improve if they did it in seasons.  Sure, the thought of waiting months for the next arc is a bit frustrating, but at least the fans would get something worth watching.
Art: Nothing really to say about art, it's really typical so I wouldn't say it stands out.  
Sound: Most of the opening and closing seem to fit appropriately with the genre of the anime, same goes for the background music used in the anime.  Character's voice all fit nicely with their respectively characters, which helps to bring out their unique personality.
Characters: The characters themselves are average, like most series, they all tend to wear the same clothes all the time, probably to better acquaint you with them.  What I'd like to comment about is the use of skills, at first you see their unique skills and you find it really exciting, but some of them are really getting overused (Naruto's Rasengan), this again, leads back to the fillers.  If there were less fillers, their wouldn't be a need to do such a thing and fans wouldn't get so sick of seeing the same skills over and over again.
Enjoyment: I did enjoy it, but you have to look at it as a whole, which means in the presence of the fillers, in which case my enjoyment decreased as each episode goes by and getting frustrated at seeing Naruto's Rasengan for the billionth time really didn't help either.    
Overall: A good anime consists of many different aspects, each must come together nicely for the series to be successful and for a good rating.  Naruto lacks in some areas, and no surprise, the ratings are what it is.  I'd still recommend it to those who wishes to enjoy all anime like I do, but for those easily frustrated by long series, this is not for you.",7

                This is my first review. I hope I don't come off as too much of a jerk.
I watched quite a bit of anime before I watched Naruto. I have had some beautiful high points while watching (FMA Brotherhood) and some disappointing lows (SAO). Sadly Naruto was one of those lows.
Story: 4
Repeat after me: FILLER EPISODES!
This was the worst for me. I usually binge watch anime, so sometimes watching 3+ episodes in a row where the plot made next to no progress became a little mind numbing. Not only that, but the main story line was just kind of boring. I never felt entertained by it.
                  Most of the entertainment I got was either unintentional or just basic slapstick humor.
Art: 5
I've seen better and I've seen worse.
Sound:7
The sound is great. The themes set the scene well, and the Japanese voice acting is great. I don't have any experience with the dubbed version however.
Character: 5
I hate Sakura and Sauske. They are crappy, underdeveloped characters that are whiny and annoying. It's a shame that they are main characters. Naruto is okay. The only characters I liked were Shikamaru and Rock Lee. To directly quote my friend Matt, ""Rock Lee is a badass. Everybody wishes they were Rock Lee."" The only reason he watched Naruto was to cheer on his boy Lee.
Enjoyment: 4
Wow. When it comes down to it, I only finished the series to put it on My Animelist. There, I said it. Even Rock Lee wasn't enough to save this show. I honestly didn't enjoy it too much.
Overall: 4
Needs moar Rock Lee.",5

                Naruto is truly a special anime that flourishes in heart, intrigue, originality, and emotional impact.
This review is only for the canon episode 1-135.
The original Naruto, meaning the pre-timeskip story, has earned its place among the very best of the shonen battle genre in my book. Every single-story arc brings a unique storyline that is filled with emotional, suspenseful, and epic moments and builds on the world and characters of Naruto. The world of Naruto is filled with originality and detail. The lore of the villages, the clans, various jutsus, and many other detailed systems give you great insight into the complexity of this world. 
The
                  story will show you the harsh and sad nature of the ninja world, and how it has affected the people who live through it. Naruto’s story is not only exciting and emotional, it also has a lot of thematic depth. Ideas of loneliness, failure, pain, hate, genocide, social class systems, revenge, and many more are explored through this story.
Kishimoto's ability to not only write compelling main characters, but also write an assortment compelling side characters is one of the underrated aspects of the Naruto series. This anime is filled with unique characters that have so much to offer down to the nuanced side characters. Seeing how our protagonist and his friends/rivals develop over the course of these 135 episodes is amazing, and specifically between Naruto and Sasuke is one of the best examples of a compelling relationship and parallel in all of anime. 
The deep emotional impact of Naruto is well-known, and I will completely agree this this story will tug at your heartstrings. In the shonen battle genre, I can think of no other anime that even rivals it in this regard aside from One Piece. Another skill of Kishimoto’s is his well written backstories for his characters. There are numerous backstories for both primary and secondary characters that are made with such care and passion that you come to understand these characters in a way that most anime don’t achieve. It also mixes some comedy elements at the right times that are genuinely funny, and dont feel overbearing like many other shonen.
The final point of excellence that most recognize is that it has exciting and strategic action. It contains many of the most incredible and iconic fight scenes in all of anime that contain intricate plans and cool abilities. Naruto is the definitive king of hype when it comes to anime. There is no other anime I know that pulls off epic moments of overcoming obstacles, suspense, coolness, and achieving something great.
It's a very fun series, and I think it balances all of its aspects well to show originally what makes a great shounen battle series. Its multifaceted and excels in nearly all areas. The canon story is contained in episodes 1-135 which are the only episode I recommend you watch from the original Naruto anime, unless you are interested in filler. 
Once again, Naruto is very special to me. I think is deserves more respect as a great work in the anime community; its not just a mainstream surface level anime. It an excellent anime that offers so much, and is fully rewarding to experience.",10

                For some reason, every single review I read on MAL  looks like they were typed by a person who is about 12 years old, but trying to seem like they are a seasoned writer. I won't be doing that. This is my honest opinion with no attempt to razzle and dazzle you. (Though, I may not be able to help it, as my writing tends to be on the more ""professional"" side because of my profession lol). 
Anyways! If you haven't watched Naruto yet, GET ON IT.
Why should you watch it? I'll tell you why: it's incredible. I am a normal adult male. I
                  am not a self-described ""anime freak,"" though I thoroughly enjoy a ton of anime. This show doesn't feel like your typical anime. This is a show that everybody can enjoy. You get to see the life and progression of a little jackass in a village full of serious ninjas and over time, you begin to see a bit of yourself in Naruto. (At least, I did. I was just like him. Lashing out, being mean to people, and all the while hurting on the inside). But, there is so much more to it. Naruto starts out as a show about this kid that nobody likes but when the show progresses, you learn so much about him. You learn why he acts the way he does and you begin to feel for him. You want to reach out and tell him ""everything will be ok."" However, there is no need for that. The sheer optimism of this kid fills you up with hope and joy. By the end of the series, he had fulfilled his goal to become Hokage and he is one of, if not THE, strongest ninja in the world.  When its over, you realize, I have grown up with this kid. It makes you think why you aren't doing better in your own life. Believe it, achieve it. Signing off folks.",10

                Ah.... Memories. Aside from Pokemon and Digmon, I can proudly say that this was my first anime series.
For this review, I would only be covering on the Naruto series not the Shippuden one. The series portrays a young ninja named Naruto that aims to become the next Hokage(Leader) of the Hidden Leaf Village.
I'll start off with good parts of this anime, the story or plot line is brilliantly done, with good twists every now and then makes the viewers ever more curious to know what is coming next, this is what truly makes the series addicting. Character wise, really good back story for each of
                  the characters, although most of the supporting characters of the series is shown on Shippuden. Even so, the series tried its best to form a relationship between the reader and the characters which render the viewers more attached to the series and thus creates ""viewers loyalty""
As there is light, there will always be shadows, one of the main cons of this series is that with episodes reaching over hundreds, there are way too many fillers and unnecessary mini-stories. I understand that the purpose of fillers is to make time and space for the writers to come up with idea for the main story line, but sometimes the fillers are way too long. The visuals are not as well done compared with other anime. For instance comparing it with the 2006 anime series Fate Stay Night, the visuals are quite lackluster.
With that being said, the pros of this series clearly outshines its cons. In my opinion, the story line of the anime is much more of significance compared with visuals and such. Oh yea, there are way too many openings and ending songs too cover, but leave it at that, some are good and some mediocre. All in all, this is one of the anime that I would consider a gem and would hold a special place in me as this is also the anime that brought me into the anime universe.",9

                Keep in mind that this is a BUILDUP to naruto shippuuden. all the climaxes etc. happen in the shippuuden series. Don't miss out!!
Story: Good story, though it has some flaws, but no big ones ofc. 8/10
Art: love it. ofc it isn't like an anime from 2020, but for it's time, it was good. 8/10
Sound: best soundtracks ever. Solid 10/10
Characters: love naruto, Kakashi, Jiraiya, orchimaru, Itachi, Tsunade etc. though except for naruto, they are side characters. Hate sakura and sasuke (though they redeem themselves in shippuden) Sadly, those 2 are main characters.enjoyment: can't even describe how much i loved naruto. ez 10/10
overal: solid 9/10",9
"
                Before I watched Naruto, I thought it looked pretty lame. I now realize I was speaking out of ignorance more than anything. I was basing my inferences on the crappy commercials from cartoon network. MAKE SURE TO WATCH THE SUBBED VERSION. 
Story - Naruto possess an amazing story. I found myself getting all teary eyed a bunch of times as I watched it. Quite embarrassing. The one flaw is that they over use the flashback technique. They show memories that make you feel all sad. The first time you watch Naruto this won't bother you, but if you intend to re-watch it, it becomes extremely
                  annoying and tiresome. I found myself skipping huge chunks of the anime the second time around.
Art - One word explanation. Great.
Sound - Almost all of the music is great. Some of the intro songs are bad though. Like the first OP song. &quot;I wanna rocks, rocks to the chest.&quot; What the hell does this mean? I don't know.
Overall Naruto is a great show. The biggest flaw is the enormous amount of fillers. Stop watching after about episode 135 because there is no more plot development, just a whole load of crap.",9
"
                               The creator of Naruto series is written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto sensei all he had to do is to create one of the greatest manga work and eventually lead to anime adaptation by one of the significant studio by Studio Pierrot for visual treat. Naruto is based on the shinobi jonor in which we all get to know about the various themes and elements of hardships, leadership, importance of friendship, realities, loneliness, hatredness, student and teacher relationship, sacrifices etc.
STORY    Naruto is a fictional story regarding the adventures of the protagonist of the series Uzumaki Naruto along with his companions. Naruto aims to be the Hokage ( Highest office ) of  the village Konahagakure. Naruto is crazy and troublesome guy who always trouble people for gaining recognition, as his parents died for a noble cause. Naruto is an orphan and always it's a sad to see as no one consider him as a person and they treat him like demon. Naruto is a weak shinobi. But there it comes with the load of background music there starts the journey of Naruto in which, what, why he able to defeat odds, how he is successful, sets a new definition of friendship in manga and anime.
CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
              Along with Naruto there are many other exceptional characters. Most of the characters have background stories which is great for Shounen long running anime. It's always a good insight for a anime to show the depths of the characters and their goals. Even senseis role is almost the backbone of the story where they mould their students for making them full fledged shinobi. There are some episodes in which scenes are emotions based on the reality grounded and I got tears. So, I want to share one of my experiences regarding a character Rock Lee when he fights Gaara in Chunin exams when he was fighting very hard and had tough times in which there was a flashback of him and sensei regarding discussion of hardwork. And his sensei states to Rock Lee that ""you are genius at hardwork"" . And then Rock Lee gets tears in his eyes and looks at his sensei and offers his gratitude during the fight. I liked the description of most of the characters and their evolutions by bringing new techniques for making fights more intense and insane. I admit that most of the characters shared coordinal relationship with Naruto and it took shape brilliantly by Kishimoto sensei. Most of the companions of Naruto they considered Naruto as a inspiration.
ANIMATION
              It was a great prospect for Naruto anime series that it was adapted by Studio Pierrot. Animation at the times of 2000's was not good for present generation but I have to respect the those times and I have to move on. Fight scenes are very rich and intense fights are shown very well. The characters are shown very fluently but there are some errors regarding the animation it sulks little bit though I enjoyed. The village and forest scenes shown very excellent by covering all kinds of backgrounds well captured by studio Pierrot. It was a good animation and it was very pleasant and satisfied regarding the various techniques in the fight scenes are shown with extreme mix and caution. At last I want to say that Studio Pierrot didn't disappointed me in animation.
MUSIC
              Mostly I like this segment just sounds wow regarding some of the openings of Naruto is well shown and they showed situation driven oriented related openings in every arc. Background music of Naruto is worth mentioning regarding the intense rage, excited, emotion based is great while fight scenes got boost due to the background music. Background music represented each and every scenes and situations, even humor fittingly. So far they did great job for handling the Naruto work.
For Orochmaru character the background music was nail bitting.
When the characters use their jutsu in fights the music was getting better and better and I liked the intensity of music and it is a great plus for Naruto anime series.
SPECIAL MENTION
              In Naruto series most of them stated that there are so many fillers in which most fillers ruined the complexity of the story and there are some fillers which are worth watching. I to agree. So if u skip the fillers or if you watch the fillers that's completely based on your schedule and interest. I watched fillers and I found some of them are annoying and some sort of lengthy narration ruined the episodes and some are great.
              If you are starters then go and watch Naruto anime which gives you a great platform as a anime watcher. It is a great and simple story which the characters justifies themselves with all sorts of elements shown in a typical Shounen anime.
CONCLUSION
              At last I want to conclude that Naruto is by far one of the greatest anime. I want to acknowledge their efforts and hardwork of Masashi Kishimoto sensei, Studio Pierrot, TV Tokyo etc put in this whole series is great and best in it's own way. I enjoyed myself like never before. When I remember the character Naruto I always become emotion, passion, excited that I wanted to follow his ninja way and his philosophy.",9
"
                I originally refused to watch the Naruto series all together simply because the characters appeared annoying and childish to me.  I eventually tried watching it and failed the first and second time.  I eventually saw the fight scene between Naruto and Sasuke on youtube and this allowed me to give the series more of a chance.  I rather liked it. 
This is one of the harder series to write a review for due to the sheer length of it.  There are too many recaps throughout episodes; these take up sometimes 10-15 minutes of a 23 minute episode which is rather annoying.
                   Filler episodes are also littered throughout the series which can be beneficial or annoying depending on how many and how bad/good each episode is.  The last 40 episodes consist of about 20 filler episodes which was horrible.  The length also gives it several benefits character development is one of the most notable (Maybe not for Sakura…).  Character growth and evolvement is visible in many of the main and supporting characters especially Naruto and Sasuke.
The animations throughout the series are solid and there are several instance of using unique art styles to help enhance fight sense and humor.  The voice acting is well done but, the dialogue can be very cheesy at time, making one possibly slam their face into a wall.
Naruto is an exciting series that has a solid and creative storyline complimented with excellent character development.  Regardless of any shortcomings previously mentioned Naruto is a solid series and worth watching.  It also has some of the best fight scenes in anime.",8
"
                Note: Please excuse the length; but to do 220 episode anime justice, I think a long review is necessary.
Naruto is a bit of a paradox in anime. It's pretty rare for a series to be as consistently bashed by experienced anime viewers. However, I doubt that there is another series that has been more commercially successful internationally and has helped grow anime viewership in the west than Naruto. Despite the hatred it receives from the astute critics and connoisseurs of anime, even the majority of today's anime elitists in the west are probably anime fans as a direct or indirect result of this show's influence
                  whether they admit it or not. Further, it still has among the largest and most dedicated fanbases out there. In that sense, it's like the Metallica of anime; hated by the die-hard fans, but extremely commercially popular and the reason most metal fans are metal fans in the first place.
Naruto is set in a universe in which Ninja possess mystical and spiritual powers. It is set primarily in Konoha, or the Hidden Leaf Village, and follows the life of Naruto, a young Leaf Shinobi who is hated by the entire village as he is the vessel for a spiritual monster who once attacked the village, as he seeks to overcome his low social position in the village and turn into an elite ninja, in fact the leader of his village. The plot also focuses on Sasuke, Naruto's best friend and rival, who comes from a prominent family in the village that was killed off by his brother, is widely perceived as the best and most popular student, who seeks revenge on his brother for murdering his clan and (minor spoiler) turns towards the dark side as he seeks his revenge.
Right off the bat, you see the potential for an extremely good plot. We have a bildungsroman in Naruto about overcoming one's social position and starting point in life through free will and hard work, essentially avoiding Sartrean bad faith if you will. Sasuke is used as a foil to Naruto, starting from the opposite position yet is eaten up by hatred and need for revenge. All this set in a compelling universe drawing richly off of Japanese history and mythology with a very large cast of likeable characters.
At least, that's what Naruto could have been. Unfortunately, the great potential for this show's concept is absolutely wasted with poor execution and we are beaten over the head that accomplishes almost nothing thematically or narratively in 220 episodes. Instead of the plot I laid out above, Naruto's main conflict is resolved, or perhaps more accurately dissolved, in the first couple dozen episodes as he's pretty quickly accepted by those around him.  Naruto's motivation then becomes becoming stronger because...well, no reason. Instead, all we get is continuous cliche shounen dialogue from Naruto (and almost every other character, for that matter) about how he must ""work hard and become stronger"" at almost every moment where the show tries (and ultimately fails) to conjure up some meaning and emotion. Naruto’s motivations become almost exactly what was being satarized in the film Rubber: “no reason.” Rather than relating Sasuke's plot to Naruto's main struggle, Sasuke's plight (which, in many ways, is extremely superior to Naruto's) becomes a sort of side plot to Naruto's training.
That said, there are certainly some moments where Naruto lives up to its potential. For example, the climax of the Konoha Crush, particularly the development of Gaara's character, was fairly well done, if dragged out far too long. And the Sasuke Chase arc, particularly the climax battle just before the filler arc, was riveting and developed each of the major characters fairly well. However, just after Sasuke's plot climaxes--the show just completely drops any semblance of plot. For almost 100 episodes, there is absolutely no development (with the possible exception of Gaara in the last serial ""Village of Artisans"") on any of the threads developed in the first half of the show, it is literally all filler. Normally, I'm quite a fan of shows with a ton of ""filler"" as it provides room for deeper character development, the introduction of minor characters who may play a role later, an opportunity to develop an aesthetic atmosphere, and a better emotional connection between viewers and characters. Examples of this done very well is the early bits of Fullmetal Alchemist, most of Samuari Champloo, and some of the middle parts of Monster. However, Naruto accomplishes almost none of this in the infamous ""filler arc.""  With few exceptions, almost none of the already lackluster characters are developed further. Far too much time is spent on developing the backstories of side characters who have absolutely no connection to the main plot or, worse yet, on childish comic relief episodes that contribute absolutely nothing at all to the show, and in fact detract from it because they're not only a waste of time but mostly horribly unfunny.
Speaking of lackluster characters, Naruto falls apart in this department. For a plot that tries to be a bildungsroman, Naruto himself is absolutely static, flat, one-dimensional, and is perhaps the worst character in the entire series. Almost every character is identical thematically; they have experienced some major loss of a loved one in the past that is explained far too slowly in a series of long-wound out flashbacks or far too quickly through contrived dialogue in the middle of battle (because when one is fighting, it's obvious that everyone tells their entire life story), and all their motivations and behaviors are completely traced back to this one incident. Almost every major character is a clone of Naruto in terms of motivation, just wanting to be the ""strongest"" for no apparent reason. Additionally, almost every major character is just a cliche copy of your typical Shounen stock characters. Finally, the antagonists--especially the main antagonist, Orochimaru--are simply awful; their motivations are either explained by a backstory that is identical to every other, or not explained at all.
There are three main exceptions, Gaara, Sasuke, and Neji. Let me explain why, though I might have some minor, vague spoilers in my justification. Those characters are all fairly dynamic, thematically engaging, and have motivations that actually have something to do with their backstories beyond ""I just lost someone I love."" In Gaara's case, we find someone who learns human empathy and acts (or at least would act if they did a better job with Naruto) as a foil to Naruto's demon within in connection to a back story in which his concept of human empathy is destroyed by the blind hatred and loss of the person he loves the most. In Neji's case, we see someone who learns the value of free will in connection to his backstory revolving around his place in a rigid social hierarchy, with also somewhat of a foil to Naruto. And in Sasuke's case, a character who slowly turns darker and darker in his quest for revenge (although, as I mentioned, his characterization is ultimately dropped and left incomplete), though despite his prominence in the main plot is far too thematically disconnected from Naruto. Those three characters have really good depth and showcase the best of what Naruto has to offer. There’s also one minor exception: Menma, who is arguably the best character in the entire series, a character who has an entirely different type of backstory and who appears only in three episodes at the very end of the series, but I will not explain more in the interest of avoiding spoilers.
Despite how poorly the characters are written, for some reason almost all of the major cast is very likable and addicting to watch. Even though the characters are poor in a literary sense, there is some reason I just can't quite explain why I can't completely dismiss Naruto's characters. There's a sense in which one has a sense of nostalgia for characters like Shikamaru, Hinata, Shino, and Rock Lee when they aren't on screen, even if they aren't the best-written characters. Maybe it's in the way their movements are animated, or the fact that they are just similar enough that they remind you of better-written characters in other animes in subtle ways without being too cliche, or maybe because they do have fairly entertaining personalities and various idiosyncrasies. However, even the poorly written characters add to the enjoyability of the series.
Arguably other than the poorly executed and clunkily prolongated plot, the art is the worst feature of this anime. I do not mean necessarily the animation, though I will have more to say about this below, I am talking about the cinematography: directing style, dialogue, camera angles, and other artistic decisions that can often make or break a series. Even though the plot is so poorly executed and I've given it a lower score than the art (I consider cinematography a part of the art score even though most people think art refers primarily to animation, I think MAL should have a directing score), I would venture to say that the cinematography  is the thing that primarily destroys Naruto's quality. It features all the standard tropes of mediocre Shounen anime that makes mediocre Shounens, well, mediocre: long-drawn out battles that are so slowly progressed they're tedious; unrealistic dialogue in the middle of fighting; poor, childish attempts at comedy thrown in at the worst times; repetitious jokes that became unfunny about the third time they were told (we get it, Jariaya’s a pervert, Koji is fat, and Kakashi likes romance novels); cliche camera angles like zooming in on a character’s eye randomly during an emotional moment, zooming in on the face during a thought/aside, or doing an angled pan shot over a battle scene during an unnecessary bit of dialogue; and extremely long flashbacks either to another identical tragic backstory to a trivial character or to events that literally happened two or three episodes ago.
Speaking of dialogue, Naruto is almost laughably bad in this respect. If you hate your liver, take a shot every time some character's only line is the name of another character for no good reason, or every time someone says some variation of ""I'll train harder""/""I need to become stronger;"" or anytime someone screams out the name of whatever fighting move they're using, or every time there's some variation of ""I'm going to beat you""/""I'm gonna bring you down""/""There's no way you can beat me""/another similar cliche line that a dumb jock would utter during a sporting event. But the worst aspect of dialogue, which is more generally a problem in most shounen anime, is the way every single battle tactic is spoon-fed to the viewer through unrealistic dialogue thrown in the middle of a battle, the same way that every character's motivation is completely spoon-fed to the viewer--down to the point that if there's any tension in relationship to a character, five minutes are wasted on a flashback to scenes we've already seen before. I would expect a show about ninja to convey an atmosphere of mystery; but instead, you're continually patronized by contrived, spoon-fed explanations and dialogue.
Despite my problems with the cinemetography and writing, the reason why I still don't think the art deserves a lower score is because the animation is not all bad. There are a couple slipshod moments early on in the series, and it's certainly nothing to write home about, but it's far from the worst animation I've seen. I'm generally not a fan of Studio Pierrot's style (see how they ruined the second season of Legend of Korra), but something about it is fitting for Naruto's atmosphere.
The sound is also adequate in Naruto. The Japanese cast is mostly fairly good, though a few of them sound somewhat cliche. I'm ashamed to admit I watched most of this show in the English dub (simply because it's so long and I wanted to multitask a little while watching); though it's far from the worst dub out there, in fact I'd say the acting is fairly decent (maybe not the translations, I’ll defer to Japanese speakers on that), it's not as good as what I've seen from the sub. The soundtrack is also fairly nice; there are a few tracks, particularly the tribal sounding one and some of the more J-pop sounding ones, that are campy and cliche, but it generally enhances OST generally enhances the anime fairly well. Like most anime of this length, it could have benefited from more tracks on the OST as it gets fairly repetitive and predictable near the end. However, there are quite a few brilliant sounding tracks in this OST; particularly some of the softer variations of the main theme.
With as many deep, deep flaws that I've pointed out, one would expect me to say I did not enjoy this series at all and would not recommend it. But this is not the case. Despite it's flaws aesthetically and even though I intellectually bash it as a critic, as a simple fan there's something deeply enjoyable about Naruto. I'll admit this was my first exposure to anime as a child as I watched the dub come out as it was released in the States, but there's something more to my enjoyment of this anime than childhood nostalgia. Though there are too many battles and they are far too long-drawn out, something should be said for Naruto's battle scenes in that they are effectively used as a storytelling mechanism rather than a device to accomplish as much action as possible, as happens all to often in Shounen anime (eg., Code Geass R2). Additionally, sometimes the strategy involved in the battles is fascinating, especially if Shikamaru's involved. The plot in the first half also isn't a complete loss as it is at least entertaining, if poorly executed.
Even the much-bashed filler arc is still enjoyable to watch; there are quite a few standout serials that do develop the characters well, such as Hinata in the search for the Beatle, Kurenai-sensai in Yakumo's serial, and Gaara in the Village of Painters. There are also a few serials that stand out as just being plain good stories, such as the Gosunkugi, the Star Village mission, and the search for Menma's memory (which was my favorite part of the entire series). There's also something to be said, at least in some of the serials, for the atmosphere created by the episodic nature of the filler arc. Some of my favorite anime are episodic atmospheric series such as Mushishi and there's a sense in which Naruto's filler arc is similar, if vastly inferior in quality. In fact, I'm the first to defend an anime that lets plot take the back seat and focuses on character development and atmosphere, such as Mushishi, Hotarubi no Mori E, Hotaru no Haka, or Sword of the Stranger. This style is an accurate reflection of the Noh tradition in Japanese theater and a refreshing escape from the over-domination of plot in western storytelling that we've inherited from Aristotle. If Naruto had been episodic from the beginning and had executed its atmosphere better, the filler arc would've been fine and even completely enjoyable; but it was ultimately a letdown after the first half which was extremely plot-based and was ruined by poor attempts at humor.
To sum up, despite all its flaws, it is easy to see why Naruto is among the most popular anime out there, especially among younger viewers and I still thoroughly enjoy it. It's an easy watch, highly entertaining, fairly easy to pick up in the middle (which makes it perfect for Cartoon Network's clientele), and the characters are very likable if bad in a literary sense. If you have the time to dedicate to it (and at 220 episodes, it is quite an investment) I'd say it's worth watching. And everybody should watch the three-episode Menma serial if nothing else, which works great as a stand alone. But definitely, don't expect anything profound or stellar out of this anime, and be prepared to be vexed by its campy dialogue and awful cinematography.

                This is one of the most high quality anime out there.
I mean what more could you want? Although there are some flaws to this anime.
Even though the story and plot are amazing, the art seems a bit outdated. 
Also if your watching  on some streaming site like Crunchyroll, there are black bars on the sides which can be irritating at some times. 
But besides that, Naruto is a great anime overall and one of my personal favourites. You can enjoy this anime with friends and family. Although sometimes the show can get a bit dark and bloody, overall there is nothing too bad.

The history of anime is good, the plot is very good, the situations of struggle or story are good, the 'humanity' of some of the characters will disappear and others will emerge, and the end I thought it was good that we did a kind Bridge for shippuden.
But there is a lot of ridiculous thing in Naruto, which are clichés, eg women, who are men (I'm not talking about Sasuke hehe), boring fillers '-', Kakashi model (ashamed to show your face), very cool guy call gai, three team in the Naruto practically had: the most badass (Sasuke, Neji, Kakashi, Orochi), was weaker
                  than the most badass wanted to be better (Naruto, Lee, Obito, Jiraiya) and women healed wounds (Sakura, Ino, Rin, Tsunade).
The animation is sometimes very zuada more in the general context it is good, the soundtrack is mythical, plus the voice acting is pretty bad.
As it has many characters, some have the same personalities, plus the very different powers and objectives only has virtually Sasuke differently, the rest either becomes stronger, and the villains are not as good.
The anime is pretty cool, plus the fillers are many boring, if you do not get bored and give up anime, skip the fillers.
Texto escrito em Pt-Br(Minha lingua)
A história do anime é boa,o enredo é muito bom,as situações de lutas ou história são boas,a 'humanidade',de alguns dos personagens vão desaparecendo e em outros vai surgindo,e o final eu achei bom por que fez uma especie de ponte para o shippuden.
Porém existe muita coisa rídicula em Naruto,que são os clichês,exemplo:mulheres,que são homens(não estou falando do sasuke hehe),fillers chatos '-',kakashi modelo(tem vergonha de mostra o rosto),muito maneiro o cara se chamar gai,nos time de três no naruto,praticamente tinha:o mais fodão(Sasuke,Neji,Kakashi,Orochi), era mais fraco que o fodão mais queria ser melhor(Naruto,Lee,Obito,Jiraya) e as mulheres que curavam ferimentos(Sakura,Ino,Rin,Tsunade).
A animação algumas vezes é muito zuada,mais no contexto geral ela é boa,a trilha sonora é mítica, mais a dublagem é muito ruim.
Já que tem muitos personagens,alguns tem personalidades iguais,mais os poderes bem diferentes,e os objetivos só tem praticamente o Sasuke de diferente,o resto quer se torna mais forte,e os vilões não são tão bons.
O anime é bem legal,mais os fillers são muitos chatos,se não quiser ficar entediado e desistir do anime,pule os fillers.",8

                Naruto...
What can I say? Next to pokemon, Naruto is a classic.  Especially for people who grew up watching it. Now I don't do reviews often so take that in to consideration while you're reading this
Naruto is set in a fictional world where ninja roam the land and use techniques called 'jutsu' to amplify their performance. To do this ninja need chakara (similar to kainin DBZ) which is basically their life's essence. Everyone has it, but ninja know how to harness it.
Story:10
Naruto is a story about a boy with the same name. The story centers around him and hos friends. As it progresses you see
                  everyone maturing and getting stronger as well as bonds deepening. Yhe story is brilliantly complied into it's own arcs, with fillers being in its own arc. You will see rulers rise and fall. Enemies and organizations Being destroyed or created. And all this is happening to a growimg ninja boy
Art: 7
The art was very unique in some episodes. However, you'll mostly see the same kind of background and clothing in the anime. There isn't too much diversity, but when there is, it's extravagant. Just get used to the sight of either a forest, rocky or barren terrain as the fight scenes have all of them
sound: 9
The sounds as well as the music were all amazing. You hear some repeats from there but everything was great. From the dialogue,  to the intro and outro music, to the sound effects of the fighting! The sounds definitely make this anime that much more amazing
Character: 10
Each and (almost) every character is improved upon. Even Sakura herself yes. Those who don't need improvement have wonderfully thought out backstories that are impossible to know NOT know. I can't think of any suggestions when it comes to this
Enjoyment: 10
The anime never stops to cease to amaze me. Even after taking a 2-4 year break from it, I came back. Back to the 1st big fight scene between Naruto and Sauske. I wanted to skip fillers and other non-canon episodes so that I can have more time with shippuden. But I couldn't.  Thats how enjoyable Naruto is...
Final score: 9- Great
This anime hit the mainstream market and is praised by many for good reason. It is a one of a kind action comedy anime. Perhaps it may be for you or it may not. Who knows, you can be the next guy/gal running around with their hands behind their back ;)",9

                Many watched Naruto as kids and grew up with it. Me on the other hand, I'm one those who discovered this series when it was already done, and I was in my 20s. I had also already watched FMA:B a couple years before. so it wasn't quite my first anime. I was very skeptical of Naruto: its character designs seemed unappealing, and its ninja seemed to have nothing to do with real life ninja. I went into it expecting nothing.
I watched the first episode not even knowing about Naruto's true nature. So I was genuinely wowed by that early plot twist. What surprised me most
                  about it was to see a story that at first seemed to just be a show about some troubled kid with a lot yelling suddenly take a turn for something actually quite heavy and and quite heartfelt. It signaled to me that this anime packed something more, and was willing to cover engaging, emotional storylines. It had a heart.
The characters of this story are an odd mix. They all start out pretty annoying, and in the first episodes, the main trio of Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura keep bickering nonstop, and all the other kids are very immature as well. This can easily be plainly annoying. Naruto especially took a long while for me to find likable. 
But while we have these seemingly weaker characters, some well fleshed out antagonists are introduced, and when all things are considered, most of the characters in Naruto follow a pattern of starting out pretty one dimensional but then being built upon through the following arcs, so that by the end of the series, I found them to be quite endearing.
The fights are a big part of Naruto, often lasting multiple episodes. They are always very entertaining to watch, with a good element of tension, a wide range of powers showcased and a lot of thought been put in the progression of the fight. The fight also often reflect a mental hurdle or ideological struggle that Naruto faces, which gives them a double value as both exciting and emotional fights.
In short, Naruto is a crowd-pleaser. It has those two essential things, emotion and action, and it is effective at conveying both.
It wouldn't be a complete review without mentioning the filler. This series (the first part of the whole Naruto saga) is different from its sequel Shippuuden in that for the most part there is no filler intertwined into the canon... instead it is all lumped in the second half of the series. This makes it possible to see the whole series without having to do the incessant episode-skipping that Shippuuden requires.",9

                so I truly belive Naruto is the best anime heres some reason why 
Firstly Naruto is part 1 aka og Naruto could beat Goku however hype beast goku sadly he carnt. the only reason why you should hate on Naruto is because of sakura that's shit fuckingly horrible character actually made me puke!!! I also love Naruto because of the filler I love the that's why I love shippuden. 
why I think Naruto is better than any other shonen besides bleach
One Piece- that show is just terrible to many episodes so whenever I thinjk about one piece I imagine fat twats who just wanna be
                  pirates 
Dragon ball-dragon ball is so bad all the show is just big buff men screaming oooooooooooooooommmmmmm so this also links with jojo and dragon ball is just for people with no brains. goku isn't that strong saitamam  
fairy tale- I am a man of tits so I like this show but it isn't as good Naruto 
AOT- that show is awful nopt at just as Naruto very basoc plot 
mha- THE GAY SHIPS 
so this concludes my love for Naruto if this post gets over 500 likes I will carry on about Naruto",10

                I must insist, to read the manga. The anime sucks and I was totally disappointed. Everyone's voice was different. I imagined Naruto's to be more hyperactive, Hinata's less whispery, Sasuke's less mature....The Manga was an absolute masterpiece by Kishimoto and the Anime totally ruined Naruto's reputation. The first opening theme as you all know is crap, consists mostly of shouting than singing. 
I can understand why everyone hates Naruto. I did too as I read to Manga first and place so much HOPE that Naruto will be a success. The manga was so much better than the anime, there was more detail and everything was
                  from the imgination and genius of Kishimoto. I thought the anime was created by martins at the lack of genius. But at least the storyline and plot still creates a somewhat suspense. 
I ask everyone now, to read the naruto Manga, the original, created by Kishimoto than crappy anime by MADMAN TM. The Manga was a masterpeice and kept my obsession alive.",7
"
                All right, first review on the site, and probably not the last one. I remember that a friend of mine suggested to watch the series, then I started. It wasn't bad, but sometimes I feel it's boring. The Chuunin Exam was pretty good, and that's where I decided to keep on watching the series. Right now I'm watching the Shippuuden, but currently it's on hold until it reaches a point that I found interesting in the manga. *cough* Jiraiyavspain *cough*
Some fight scenes are memorable, but they are pretty rare in that many episodes. Talking about many episodes, Naruto might have the slowest story from all
                  the animes I know. Sometimes I wish I would skip some parts, and sometimes I did: like I skipped the whole filler on the end of this series.
Now let's talk about the characters. There are characters you can easily like, and characters you can easily hate. I still don't understand why are there so many Sasuke fans, while he's the worst emo I have ever seen. However I like Shikamaru, his fights always has a twist near the end, and I actually liked Lee before his injury. After that: umm, just strange. =)
Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad series, but it could be better at some points. Skip the fillers, and have some fun. And remember: ninjas are always cool ... except if they are from Naruto.

                Despite a lot of the other reviews that i have seen, I believe that Naruto is a great anime! Honestly i believe that it is probably my favorite anime including Naruto Shipuden - that i obviously won't say anything thing about, because this is about part 1.  Naruto is a very happy anime and very fun to watch because it is so fun.
Story: Honestly, i love the story line, it focuses on Naruto, who because he is the Nine-tails jenjurici, gets despised by the whole village. I know that this is moving to some people, because they can relate to his feelings that are
                  shown in the anime. Naruto then gets put on a team with characters: Kakashi, Sasuke and Sakura. We find out that Sasuke has a goal to revive his slaughtered clan and kill someone. This gives alot of tension, because we know that Sasuke has alot of hatred and we want to know why.
Art: Not much to say really, as this was make in 2002, you shouldn't expect the same stuff that you see in more recent anime. though I love how they all look. <3 
Sound: The same, not reallly much to say.
Character: I love pretty much all of the characters, though i gave it a 9 insted of a 10, because i frikin HATE Hinata. Don't ask more questions about it. <3
Enjoyment: Naruto is overall a funny anime and i really enjoyed watching it <3
Overall: 11/10 would recommend watching <3 thankyou!",10

Ok this show is all about FRAKIN' NINJAS! I mean, how can somone not like ninjas?! 
yeah i cant imagine it either...anyways....
 so the main char is likke Naruto and he is like a ninja who goes to ninja school to learn ninja awesome techniques to impress hot ninja girls but unfortunetely
he doesnt has any ninja parents thats the reason why all the other ninja teenagers make fun of him.
Some day he steals a magical ninja scroll and everyone is mad at him but then its ok all of a sudden and he graduates his special ninja test by doing so....
He has like 2 friends
                  ->sakura the useless ninja and sasuke the emo boy of the village who is emo cause his parents are dead and shit.
Yadda yadda yadda they defeat the evil snake-person-man-thing-ninja orochimaru and naruto abuses his main character status to win all fights.
Everyone is happy, peace and shit, naruto gets laid the end.",8

                Naruto is an incredible anime, which gets the audience to constantly invest emotionally. Some fans even believe that it is the best anime in all of history. But as cool as Naruto is, it has one major flaw. The moral of the story is inconsistent. The creator wanted to inspire people into believing that hard work would always overcome talent. But this is contradictory to how the story really shapes out, because the main character- Naruto, is handed things, and doesn’t really work hard for it. 
When Naruto is born his parents die and is left alone in the world. The village hates him for
                  some reason as he is growing up and everyone tries to stay away from him. He is also really dumb. He is the worst student at his Ninja Academy, and is very bad at everything. He truly is the lowest someone can start at. The story keeps on depicting Naruto as the underdog who worked hard for everything and wasn’t born with any talent. That is a complete lie as the story goes forward. For example, both his parents were legendary ninja, so he got their powers which already sets him apart from the rest of his village, and gives him a huge upper hand. Also he is given extra power, because he has the nine tailed fox inside of him. That makes him not only stronger and more advantaged than the kids his age, but also many adult ninja around the world. Naruto didn’t really have to train to get powerful, he just had to activate his existing power in order to become the strongest ninja, and fulfill his dreams. 
Naruto was a great show, but because of the fact that there is a huge plot hole, it deserves to get two stars. If the main moral of the story isn’t consistent, then what’s the point of the story? The whole story is shaped around the fact that Naruto started from nothing, and he got all the way to the top. The creators wanted to inspire young kids into believing that they too could become and do anything they want if they worked hard for it. While that is a wonderful message, it is meaningless, if you have to give the main character of the story, so many advantages in order for him to succeed.",10

                I realized and accepted that not everyone is going to like something, or dislike it. No matter what the anime (or book, or game, etc.) it boils down to personal preference. So, how do you know if you'd like something you've never seen but heard so much about? 
When I first started Naruto, I saw the potential in it. From the first episode, they presented a distinct setting with distinct characters. Sure, archetypes were being followed (the boy dreaming of becoming hokage, the teacher, the rival). The first episode showed emotion and depth to its main character and what he will struggle with, along with
                  the dynamics of his interaction with other characters.
OST and EST in this anime are perfect.
Having seen all episodes, I can say at least for myself that at its best Naruto is a deeper anime than some give credit to, and can be quite addicting. A strong focus is on its characters as they develop throughout the series and there are moments of real emotion, tragedy, intensity and even just amusement. It's not perfect,and not everybody will like it,but to me it's one of my favorite anime ever..",10

                Alternate viewpoint review: (SPOILERS and REALISM follows)
Naruto is a young boy being raised in a Dystopian society where young children are trained to become assassins.
The nations of the world sponsor shinobi villages where the self-ran villages each train a significant portion of the populace to become shinobi in the interest of securing income for that village.
Naruto grows up in the Village Hidden in the Leaves, the first of the villages founded; and based upon the ""Will of Fire"" philosophy that puts village and the next generation ahead of the individual.
They are certainly the ""good guys"" compared to the Mist Village where the children once ritualistically
                  killed each other to achieve adulthood.
At the start of the series, Naruto is an orphan who is also social outcast in his own village; for he had a 9-tailed fox (a powerful being who has caused many disasters in the past) placed into him as a baby.  Despite this being a village where freakish ""jutsus""  (including infesting your body with parasitic insects, and supernatural abilities of illusion and murder) are the norm, Naruto is shunned for choices he did not make.
Motivated to gain respect and acceptance amongst the people (with an absentee Godfather who's off womanizing, he has no support at home), Naruto seeks to become a great ninja and leader of the village.
A lousy student, Naruto steals villages secrets to pass his studies and finds himself on a team with his rival Sasuke (an emo boy who only talks about murdering his brother), Sakura (infatuated with Sasuke, because murderous emos who ignore and belittle you are the hot item in this messed up village); and led by Kakashi; a man who lost all his teammates in battle and has been a black ops assassin ever since.
The group trains and progresses.  Naruto progresses by tapping into the dark forces of the fox and by transforming into a naked, prepubescent girl to gain training from his neglectful godfather (who was supposed to train him to begin with).
Sakura relies on passive-aggressive tendencies and is generally useless until much later; despite being a genius.  (good moral; Brains are useless, you just need to try hard to get everything)
Sasuke relies heavily upon his family's legacy, eyes that allow him to learn jutsus and understand them naturally; that and years of murderous hate.
The team faces their first struggle when they learn that the evil Orochimaru, a great former ninja of their village, seeks Sasuke's body.  At least they acknowledge something wrong with a man in his 60's proclaiming he needs a pubescent teenagers body.
Rather than react to the creepy stalker and take action, they instead go on about business as usual; and the result is a terroristic attack where Orochimaru assassinates the Hokage (the village leader and his former teacher).
During this, Naruto squares off against Gaara; another boy who had a monster placed into him.  Due to a brutal mindfucking by his own father, Gaara is a homicidal maniac (and unreliable assassin, nice job breaking it Kazekage!) but has his worldview shattered when Naruto proclaims he's fighting for his friends and defeats Gaara.  Sure, the fact that Naruto's monster has 9 tails and Gaara's only has 1 (a measurement of power) had nothing to do with it...
Naruto then sets out with Pervy Sage (the aforementioned Godfather) to find a woman who should be the next Hokage.  The woman is Tsunade, a woman who is a compulsive gambler, frequent drinker, and spends a great deal of power to look over 30 years younger than she is.  Apparently these are great leadership qualities in this world!
Then, as if to underline Naruto's arguments about the quality of friendship; Sasuke betrays them to run off and join Orochimaru to gain power, ignoring all the people he's killed and is offers his body in exchange for power.
Sakura, always the team player, gets Naruto to vow to return Sasuke to the village; a move that puts both their lives at risk.  Enforcing the immature, ""treat broads like crap, and they love you"" philosophy at play.
Much more happens, but basically Naruto has to deal with the fact that all the people in this world are permanently scarred (raising children to murder...nah, can't have anything to do with it right?) and is able to win people over to brighter point of view by just being a swell guy...or he kills them.
Summary:  It's actually a great series, but I figure almost everyone who's into anime has seen or heard about this series.  I felt it was important to illustrate that this series is VERY disturbing once you get passed the silly Shonen antics.",9
"
                Naruto is an Amazing Anime its characters backrounds and how sophisticated it is but it is a little annoying when some fights are dragged out sometimes that's bad other times its good as it gives more understanding and suspense the worst part of Naruto is the fillers which most people agree with like 50% of the story is just fillers especially around the second half of the story is when they start but before that it is a masterpiece and the villains are especially amazing. one of the best parts is also the intros/outros some of my favorite are the 5th intro and the 1st
                  outro wind. so if you want to have a good time watching Naruto i recommend skipping the fillers in the second half unless you want to watch them.",9
"
                THIS IS THE EMBODIMENT OF A SHONEN AND ANIME!!! TOP 1 of ALL-TIME. no other anime comes close to what this series represents and has to offer. My vocabulary isn't even big enough to describe what this series means to me. This franchise will never die. As a kid I absolutely loved it and I still do. Having something grow with you is an amazing feeling. I graduate from college next monday and I can't thank naruto enough for all the lessons this series has taught me. I'm also gonna include part 2 and naruto next generations in here instead of trying to review all
                  3. In addition, naruto has very impressionable characters and a memorable cast especially the villains. Zabuza/haku are very well written man, they literally are the reason naruto created his ninja way. Not to mention the whole shinobi aren't just tools and have emotions plot point. Freaking delicious!! Naruto, sasuke, kakashi, zabuza/haku, orochimaru, itachi, nagato (by extension Pain) , obito, and madara are the most complex and grounded anime characters in this series. Kishimoto went crazy with the pen!! Also the various dialogue put into this is just fantastic. Itachi, pain, obito, and madara have speeches that transcend a 2D plane. Furthermore, THE DUB CAAAAST!!! Everyone knew what was going on man, dub just hit so hard. Can't forget the heart-warming moments. I don't care how old I get, naruto meeting kushina will always make me cry and him saying goodbye to minato. The character arcs go stupid too. Overall, naruto just a great experience to go through. With me have watched over 500 anime series', naruto still stands above them as the best. A timeless story. Naruto next generations honestly shouldn't have happened so fast. Rushing it out to make money lead to a lot of negative consequences like quality and pacing. I have to skip through it to stay interested and the only interesting parts are with naruto and sasuke. Waiting on time travel arc to drop, but in the meantime I got other anime that will get me through it. Naruto still has a place in my heart and I will ride it out til the end, forever.",10
"
                In this review, I ignore ALL filler episodes, and I strongly recommend that anyone watching this do the same. If I didn't, this anime would get a 6 at best, which does not do justice to the episodes that are faithful to the source material. 
Naruto has the most intelligent fighting in all of anime, a varied and powerful soundtrack that never fails to compliment the scenes, intriguing villains and likable protagonists, an addictive nature, a semi-realistic art style that noticeably evolves and improves over time, and a satisfying plot, despite being a bit slow.
The problem is that all of this is basically there to
                  justify the fight scenes. If those scenes were not there, or if they were not as good as they are, Naruto becomes meh. I would estimate that more than half of Naruto is spent in fighting scenes. This huge dependence on something that, in other anime, merely adds spice to an already awesome package prevents me from ranking this up with the best of the best. 
On the other hand, those fight scenes are the best I've seen. In particular, characters will set up multi-step plans more or less right before your eyes, without you realizing it. They will then blow you away with the checkmate, and you get an explanation of exactly what they were doing before and why. This makes for intense, thrilling action that culminates in 'OH, SNAP!' climaxes. Intelligence, and not last minute powerups or brute force, wins the day in Naruto. Furthermore, abilities in Naruto always have disadvantages, limitations, or risks, which are made clear to the viewer. There are no random asspulls. Even with those restrictions, abilities are basically always used in unexpected and creative ways. The same trick never works twice. Naruto also knows when a simple, emotionally charged beat down is called for, and delivers them. In summary, Naruto is the Death Note of fighting. If that's what you want, definitely watch this anime.",8

                Finished this a while ago, but I really wanted it to have a place in my blog because it really deserves it&hellip;. What an amazing long running series! I truly liked how the characters developed over time through all the events that occur. The action&hellip; AMAZING! The choregraphy that&rsquo;s done is great and well thought out, so every moment of the anime you can appreciate the art and hard work that is being shown right in front of you. Of course, I always watch my anime SUBBED because I want to avoid Dubs as much as possible as it personally feels like it ruins the
                  original work as it revamps anime as cartoons for children. So I gladly get to dodge all of the &ldquo;Believe its!&rdquo; getting to enjoy the anime much more. The only thing that was an obstacle for me was the pacing of FLASHBACKS. It really bugged me that in the middle of the intensity of a fight they break off to a flashback to explain a character&rsquo;s motive for fighting or whatnot. Towards the end, the pacing becomes an amazing story arc leading up to the present &ldquo;Shippuden&rdquo; series, where the flashback sequences are appropriately placed for correct pacing which makes me feel better in the long run. Naruto is a strange character, yet his morales and drive as a young genin makes you want to root for him, so I became really drawn in to follow his journey until the end. May the chronicles continue!

                First time i watched Naruto i did not like it. Second time i did not like it but since all the people praised it for being so good i saw 5 episodes of it. Before that i didnt even got through the 1. And i liked it. 
The story takes place in an alternitive world where ninjas exist. And you will be following Naruto and his life as an ninja. He is an 12 year old kid who graduates from the ninja acadmey at the first episode and so his the journey begins with Uchiha Sasuke and Sakura Haruno as Team 7.
If you like the
                  system, world etc you will love this serie, even if youre not a fan of the main charachter. 
The best thing about Naruto is the story and charachters. You will feel sympathy for almost everyone and at some point you might even cry.
The music is also a great thing. Toshiro Masuda who composed the soundtrack is godlike. You will be listening to the soundtrack the rest of your life after this.
The first 135 episodes are godlike. Even tho they did censored some things its still awsome but after that the rest is just fillers. 
Then there is Shippuuden, Its a continue of Naruto when is older but they thought of Naruto as a way to make money so the Anime went down a bit.
But the Shippuuden manga is even better then the first 135 episodes.",10
"
                Naruto is definently not as good as people say it is, the story has been done to death, but most other aspects of the series are good.
Story: like previously stated nothing new here, ninja boy reaches to achieve his dreams, has many wacky and serious adventures along the way.
Art: The animation for Naruto is good, i would put it above what Shippudden is like right now, the character design isn't really all that different, i mean 5-6 sub-main characters have permanent spiked hair.
Sound: The intro themes are some of my favorite, i love Asian Kung Fu generation, and i never really listen to the endings
                  but that doesn't matter, the music they use tends to fit the scenarios, ie.no hard stuff during funny moments, but most anime has decent sound tracks.
Character: Like most shonen anime they catch with the characters, and they are all well made. You can find all the different characteristics in this anime, emo, goth(gaara), pervert, blah blah blah i gerantee you will find at least 1 memorable character in Naruto.
Because of the easily predictable story line, my enjoyment of the series is lost, half way through all the episodes you can pretty much predict who its gonna end, but its still worth your watch.
Overall im giving it an 8 good series if a tad predicatble, but hell its a shit load better than shippudden",8

                So.... Naruto. I don't really know why I'm writing this review as my first review, there are plenty already,  and I don't particularly care about the series... I guess it's one of those whims. Let's move on to the review then, I'll try to keep it short. And btw, I'm writing the review for the whole Naruto series, including Shippuden and the rest.
Naruto is without any shred of doubt, the most popular anime outside Japan today. Completely surpassed any high Pokemon, Dragon Ball or Yu-gi-oh ever achieved, the whole world all of a sudden just can't have enough ninjas. These are all for a
                  good reason, the anime completely blew most American cartoon in term of maturity, art quality, story and bgm, yet somehow keep it simple enough for kids to love. It didn't deliberately dumb itself down as if mocking 12+ years old kids brain size, yet not twisted enough to ruin an 8 years old fantasies and innocence. Suddenly kids are treated to a cartoon that not only gets you laughing but also complex and heart rending.
Now the question is, why did I only gave the anime a 6 if it is that good? Because ultimately, this anime is a kids stories disguised as something mature. And as a mid-20s seasoned anime enthusiast (read: otaku), it's just hard for me to find this engaging. Here's the complete breakdown:
Plot (5) - Debatable: Why debatable? Because maybe for younger audience, this was a masterpiece, who knows? But for me, the protracted episodes length, the out of place fillers that keeps contradicting the canon, the almost stale twists in every corner of the plot only to be replaced by yet another twists. 5 is generous.
Art (5): Completely mediocre, barely average (thus the 5). Understandable since the anime is made to be long running, but it doesn't erase the fact that the art quality is lacking compared to other shorter series from the same time.
Sound (7.5): As with other popular JUMP's anime such as One Piece, Bleach, Beelzebub, etc. the op and ed were typically beautiful, picked from various famous contemporary j-pop/rock. The in-anime BGM was nothing special.
Chara (6) - Debatable: Nothing special, typical of shonen series. Sasuke's breakthrough as one of the most likeable antagonist is pretty notable, as his duality existence with Naruto had been the driving force of this series since the time skip.
Enjoyment/Overall (6) - Debatable: It was pretty enjoyable at first, especially back at the time when I still don't mind watching anime with more than 50 episodes. But after 100+ episodes, with each episodes so protracted, with not much happening, I decided to drop the anime and just read the manga. This is not isolated to only Naruto, but I always find that anime adaptation of the manga tend to move really slowly and less enjoyable than the manga, especially if it's JUMP's.
So that's my review and I just want to leave a few words, for all of you so called 'Narutards', Naruto is not the best anime ever, it was not even close and never will be. It was good, and that's it. For trolls and haters, No, the anime is not as bad as you make it to be.",6
"
                As you can see I had to give this anime 7's all across mainly because the last 70 episodes were dreadful and drag this anime down a whole lot. With that said the first 130 episodes or so were fantastic I Must say. Naruto was one of the first animes I cracked open, and at first it appeared fresh and bold taking Anime to a new level, and it did for the most part. Although Naruto has MANY good points, it also fails miserable at many things.
Story
The Story has been kind of done before, a loser kid wanting to become a winner. But this loser
                  kid has been given some kind of special power which the leader of his ninja clan implanted in him at birth known as the Nine Tail fox. Naruto now looks to become the leader of his Ninja clan, so Naruto Uzamaki with this orange jump suit and heart wrenching battle cry &quot;IM GONA BE HOKAGE&quot; sets out to become the best ninja in his clan.
Characters
This is where I really enjoyed the show and didn&rsquo;t enjoy the show. Of course Naruto the main protagonist is interesting for a while but the anime focuses far to much on him and puts everyone else in a very long waiting line. No other characters besides Naruto and to some extent Sauske  (Narutos rival and best friend)get a fair level of development. Now the villains are certainly exciting in Naruto  and for most fans like myself, the villains actually carry the show more then Naruto. Its always interesting when the villains are conspiring mysterious schemes.
Overall
Although Naruto is entertaining at first, it quickly begins to fade as a show that&rsquo;s lived for too long. After a while the story line becomes weak and very boring as fans ache to see more of the villain instead are fed filler episodes. The characters may get annoying but to Naruto&rsquo;s credit, the fighting style and drama is very real and new. If your looking for that anime that has a good level of action, drama, and comedy you should try Naruto.",7
"
                The story was amazing.  It keeps you entertained throughout the series.  The only part I did not like about it is how the fillers are placed.  You don't really to a realistic transition, it doesn't feel smooth.  This isn't the only Naruto that has this problem, the whole series has it.  A good example of a show that has good filler transitions is the East Blue arc of One Piece, but I wont go into depth because this isn't a One Piece review.  The art is old, and for how old it was, I cant go to harsh on
                  it.  So a 6 is the right place for me, its pretty good for its time but is now outdated (The Style).  The sound is good of coarse.  The fights had good audio and the voice actors for the English Dub is perfect to me.  The voice overs really brought out my emotions and it was dead perfect, I loved the sound.  The characters are all unique, they all have back story's that go into high detail.  Since Naruto is a long anime, you really get to know them and their personality's well.  But this kind of buds into the story and makes it less smooth, but regardless its a 10 with the characters being perfect.  I loved the series and I recommend it to anyone who likes anime.  One of the best older animes in my opinion.   But I ESPICIALLY recommend it for someone who just got into anime.  It will make you love anime if you watch every episode, this is just a phenomenal anime.  This concludes my first anime list review!",9
"
                Naruto and Naruto Shippuden are my favorite anime, but i'm going to stick to my guns and give this show an honest review. 
Most people who have watched anime have seen Naruto at one point, the same goes for One Piece. For me, the face that i've been watching the show for so long kept me pulled in to keep watching when i started the series beginning to end for the first time. For other people who didn't grow up with the show this same ""pull"" may not apply, especially for the first couple of episodes the show starts off rather slow just as most
                  other anime or shows. Nevertheless i'd still recommend Naruto to anyone especially as a starter anime.
Now on to the review :p
The animation is good, nothing special but it's not bad at all especially for its time. the voice acting still holds up as spot on emotional at some times performances. This applies for both the Japanese and English dub though i do recommend the English. The story is great, some if not most episodes end in cliffhangers making me want to watch more. The show is well balanced with action and dialogue/story moments. Aside from some crappy fillers, the episodes do a good job building up the story and telling it well. Some fillers are good and fun to watch, while others seem like a complete waste of time. up until the 100's there are hardly any fillers at all and the story stays consistent with build up and excellent storytelling. The story does a good job at showing progression throughout the series, the characters mature and change and the story evolves. When one arc ends, a new one starts keeping its roots to the central story but being different at the same time to not just feel like you're seeing the same thing over again. The characterization is one of the show's best features, as the story goes on, you genuinely start to care about these characters and understand them well. Certain characters are kept mysterious when they need to be, and it's interesting to see their intentions revealed over time. With other character's it's nice to watch some change and mature as the show progresses on. The story isn't full of crazy plot twists or intense action though. However this is only part 1 of the series so it's done like that for obvious reasons i guess. The action at some points is spot on and can be surprising as well, but like i said the show can sometimes lack a real intensity.
Basically that's everything, i didn't truly have any gripes with the show, but it's obviously nothing outstanding and perfect. Still Naruto is a great show nonetheless and i'd highly recommend it.
I apologize if this review was bad, but i hope i can help at least a few people (:",8

                Post Series Depression: ~4.5 (reason after my overall statement)
Tear Factor: ~1 - 7 (wide range)
Laugh Factor: ~4 - 8 (wide range)
Drama Factor: ~5
Character Attachment: ~10
DISCLAIMER: I may have some bias for this show however I will try to keep my review objective.
Story: Can vary in quality ranging from amazing to dragging your feet in mud waiting for the next arc to pop up. Additionally ~40% of Naruto is fillers - skipping through fillers may speed up the story as some filler arcs are not necessary/canon.
Art: By today's standards - yes - the show is very behind in quality, however by this I mean resolution. The
                  art itself is iconic to its style and is still enjoyable.
Sound: Naruto has a very wide range of sounds, which keep you interested, nothing becomes monotonous as you keep listening to the show. However, the show is again old - so you may hear artifacts in the environment sounds, etc..
Characters: This show is known for its characters. Each character is unique and you're more than likely going to find a favorite at some point, or multiple favorites, or your favorites may switch when you meet new people. Almost every character has their own filler arc as well or overall character development (leading into Shippuden as well). however heavy focus is laid into the leaf village.
Enjoyment: This show has always been a favorite, I enjoyed re-watching it to make this review. I'd say you'd enjoy it if you're into shounen fighting anime.
Overall: Very long series but great too. Skip fillers if you want story only (there are online guides for this).
Post Series Depression: Though there is Shippuden after the original series. The mood, the characters, and even the fighting all change along with how the show works. Though it may still be Naruto at its core, something fundamentally changes with Shippuden that makes you miss the original series.",9
"
                This is probably the worst shounen I've ever seen.
Story: 3/10.
Art: 2/10. Easily the worst animated shounen I've seen. 
Sound: 2/10. Nothing of note here. Since the series itself is like 9001 episodes long you can probably find some good openings or endings though. I do remember Ending 4 making me want to rip my ears off, it is abhorrent.
Character: 2/10. Sasuke and Naruto are basically the dumbed-down version of Griffith and Guts. They have no chemistry, and their 'friendship' consists of Sasuke getting all the girls to look at him and Naruto expressing his envy every five seconds. Sakura is just a third-wheeler who gets
                  in the way and, oh boy, is she annoying af.
The only good characters are probably Rock Lee, Orochimaru and Kakashi. Rock Lee actually puts in hard work and strives to be the best; he doesn't have asspull demon powers to guide him through everything, and he's just a likable guy. Orochimaru is actually intimidating and has an ounce of intrigue to his character. And Kakashi, well, there's not much to hate about him. He has a cool design and is pretty chill.
Other than that, the rest of the cast is basically what you get when a 13 year old writes a 2deep4u shounen. Edgy dudes like Gaara and Sasuke make me hate rival tropes in shounen.
Enjoyment: 1/10. Do you want to go through endless filler, flashbacks and slow paced episodes with horrible artwork? Me neither.
Overall: 1/10. I'd rather watch Fairy Tail, and I despise Fairy Tail.",1
"
                When I first watched Naruto, I was amazed by all its glory. I was completely speechless of its humor, how great its art is, etc. etc. I was a total newbie to anime, for Naruto was one of my first anime I've watched.
What made me eventually grew out of Naruto is its fanbase. Naruto x Sasuke this, Sasuke that. It made me pissed off. The story was overall great, but the art, to be honest, it's not that great. The sound still impresses me even today. The character development is decent, but not that all amazing. Enjoyment is decent enough to be watched. Overall, it's
                  good for new people new to the anime world. But eventually, they will grow out of it.",4
"
                First of all, why did most people here think that naruto was a good enough show to get at least a 7? Sorry if I am going against your opinion but I personally found this show alright.
1.) The story.
At the start, naruto started off slow and I found it boring for a while until it got into it more. For that reason, I am rating the story a 6/10.
2.) Art
The art style doesn't really matter to me in an anime but I will rate it anyway. Considering that naruto was first aired in 2002, it was expected that the art style wouldn't be as beautiful
                  as some other anime's today. Knowing that I rate the art style a 6/10
3.sound
The sound in the anime was good enough for me to at least enjoy it slightly. I will rate the sound 5/10
4.) Character.
Now, this is the best thing about naruto, the characters. I found out that in the end, I got attached to some characters and wanted to see more. My favourite character would most likely be Kakashi for no reason whatsoever. I will rate the characters a 7/10.
5.) Enjoyment
This anime was enough to make me watch all of it without sleeping my way through it. It may be slow but some scenes were enough to make me hype for the next one. I rate the enjoyment a 5/10
6.)Overall
I rate this show a 5/10 overall.",5
"
                To say that I was bored when I typed Naruto into Youtube would be a little understated. I have been watching Keroro Gunso For a whole week, my computer was just fixed( watched Keroro Gunso on the PS3 web browser), and I have no real friends would make me completely bored out of my skull when I typed in Naruto…even though I never regretted it. 
Naruto follows the plot of every single Shonen to date. A Young man has something that no one else has, he begins to use the thing to fight his way to the top of his imaginary society, and he will
                  be fighting off against his best friend or family members soon. In this Anime’s Case, Naruto has a demon, he uses it’s chakra(spiritual energy if I am right) to get his way to become the leader(Hokage) of his Ninja Village.
While watching the first episode, I was honestly surprised to find the Japanese voices to be a bit annoying, so I switched to the Dubbed version and even was more surprised to find I actually liked it. The voices fit the characters well(But some of the characters sound a little too old for their age) and the script wasn’t half bad and it wasn’t censored so much that to explain the dead bodies, they say their ‘sleeping’.
The storyline is pretty much standard, but it picks up enough after the first story arc and I get pulled in after the rookie 9 meet for the first time. That takes…20 episodes.
You might be asking why I stayed in that long if the story was standard fare. And I will say because the characters are incredibly easy to relate to and even easier to like, if not love.
Naruto is pretty interesting as a main character in his own little way, and Sasuke can probably make all the girls in the world rise up and cheer if he just kisses Naruto again, and Sakura…well…doesn’t do anything but otherwise she stays out of the way most of the time and is interesting in her own way. 
The other main character is Kakashi, the most kickass teacher in the whole F’in world. He is mysterious and yet not moody, He is incredibly powerful but not arrogant, he has a great sense of humor without trying too hard. In fact, You could have given the entire series to Kakashi and he would probably have the same(if not better) success as naruto. 
The supporting characters are just as good, and all of them have a great back story and deserve to have the praise and fan fiction they get and more.
But every series has it’s downfalls for people…and for some it’s worth not watching a great anime.
The first problem(complaint) is that Naruto is filled with Fillers. And I honestly say that the popularity of Naruto thrives on Fillers. To point out why I think that, lets compare two animes that are known for Fillers.
Dragon Ball Z
A huge fight at the beginning…and then we wait the entire season for at least something like that to happen again. Meanwhile, We get to train! And Train some more! And we get to watch Goku learn two boring moves and when he finally uses them, they are nothing but wimpy when used on the two enemies where only ONE was damaged.
Naruto
The Fillers show more of the character themselves and I can’t distinguish one filler episode from just a regular one. Naruto has fillers filled with character development that I love and cherish(Except for that kid in episode 2, I smiled when he cried at the Hokage funeral =)  )
The Second problem is that Naruto has stereotypical characters. I admit, many of the characters that Fans like all have some sort of troubled past or they watched their entire village get slaughtered(WINK). But Yet again, I am not picky and all the characters are stereotypical in a way that isn’t obvious as some other animes.
The Third problem is that Naruto is copying off from other anime, which I find silly because Anime is always the same really. In fact, most of the anime you find will  look incredibly similar story wise. But Anime is special in that the characters are always new and fresh and can easily be related to. Naruto is no exception.
The Fourth and final problem is the flashbacks, and I honestly can say that you will get a flashback about every 5 to 10 minutes! And the flashbacks always focus on what happened in the last episode. There is a point where we already have gotten five different aknoledgments from the characters of what happened, we need a flashback on what just happened. 
In short, Naruto is a anime that you will enjoy if you are open minded and want something new. You won’t like it if your complaining about the characters jumpsuit and you don't like Ninjas.
That means your a Pirate guy right?",8

                Naruto means a lot to me, it was a big part of my childhood but here is where i put my personal feelings a side and review it from an objective standpoint.
The story of Naruto is a bit uneven. On one hand it brings some spectacular and great emotional moments but is brought down by the poor pacing and a lot of fillers. There are episodes with great character development, episodes with spectacle, episodes where nothing happens, episodes with turtle pacing and episodes that have fight scenes that never end. 
The art and animation is alright. Since it is a 220 episode anime the animation
                  budget for each individual episode is not equal. Some episodes look great others dont.
The soundtrack is really good. It builds up the action and gets me pumped every time. The dub is an okay dub that gets the job done but you are not missing anything.
The characters are the best thing about Naruto. They are well developed, deep and very well written. They feel human. However the antagonists(excluding Zabuza and Haku) are a bit shallow, while pretty cool looking overall not much to say about them.
For my enjoyment i can say when its good its GOOD. The chunin exam arc is the best example of this but the fights some times go on forever and filler nightmares dont help that either.
Overall Naruto is an enjoyable anime. Is it good? Yes. Is it flawed? Yes. Is it worth the hype? NO! Is it worth watching? Only if you are ready to sit through 220 uneven episodes and thats not counting shippuden.",7
"
                Naruto is my first anime and is one of the most popular animes out there after it's sequel Naruto: Shippuden.
Story was for me very enjoyable and fun. I like how they mixed up school and missions and got awesome storyline for everybody to like. Everything is about friendship, success in becoming a great ninja and honor. Once again story was very well done and I would not change a thing in it :D
Art in Naruto is very simplistic, colorful with bright themes and even the ''scary parts'' look that way. You can see good artwork in detailed backgrounds but not in characters...yes they are noticeable
                  in different ways, but not overdetailed as in some animes.
Sounds I liked very much...I can say that the soundtracks did a lot for me and my enjoyment in anime. They go well with all scenes and characteristics; happy, funny, sad, agressive etc. There are some soundtracks with flute and shamisen that I enjoyed the most, so I always get goose-bumps when I hear that kind of music in Naruto =)
The most important part that makes Naruto what it is are characters. Each different from other by looks, color, clothing, talk, ninja ranks, abilities and skills. They each have their own background story that helps the main storyline. They're all awesomely done and if you don't like anything else, you'll like the characters.
I think I already talked about my enjoyment, so I'll just say this; yes, Naruto is maybe little overhiped, but no one should get in anime with a lot of expectations and I guess it's not the best anime ever (for me it is), but it's definitely worth watching =)",10
"
                It's about 3 guienan Naruto (the annoying one) Sakura (she luvs sasuke) and Sasuke (Naruto is jealous of him) and their master Kakshei Sensei.He helps Naruto suprisingly sakura and sasuke. And Naruto's dream is 2 become the best Hokaga ever.And on the way there he makes some friends on the way.
Do you thimk Naruto will concore his dream?

                Naruto is amazingly awesome.  Until you get to the part that is completely overrun by filler.
Everything besides the filler of this show is truly good.  The story is well-designed, the art, sound effects, and music are all very high quality. The show really shines in terms of characters, featuring many characters who all express pretty good development. The story does kinda span over what seems like too many episodes, but for the most part it does deliver high quality action and character interaction very effectively.  Well, until you get to the non-canon filler.
Despite the fairly low rating I'm giving this anime, I
                  must stress that several of the most impressive moments in anime history do occur here. Character interaction at some points has never been better, and depending on the type of person you are, this anime does have the potential to bring tears to your eyes as your mind is blown away by what could be the most appropriate ending to the best fight scene you may have seen in your entire life.
Really though, you have to wonder the logic behind several of the filler episodes. It's possibly the dumbest thing that happened to what could have been one of the highest quality shows in existence.",7

                Story: 8 (Very Good)
Art: 8 (Also Very Good)
Sound: 7 (Good)
Character: 8 (This is Very Good)
Enjoyment: 9 (Great)
Overall: 9 (Grate)
Nearly every Naruto background character is Steve Blum, it is but I suppose you could have only seen two movies, or even just 1 movie and a door. Truly, no more words need be said. It is too bad that Sasuke leaves Hidden Leaf Village at the end of the series though. Crap, I am going on for too long and this review is becoming more of a rant by mistake, I sincerely apologise for that. SO THEN, THIS IS THE END OF THE REVIEW.

                  have any questions please feel free to e-mail me at DrunkyDory666@gmail.com",9

                This is my first review, and I might be a bit jumpy and in-cohesive, so I would like to apologize before you read any further. This is also the first anime I ever really watched, although my opinion of it has changed over the years.
When I first watched Naruto, I was completely obsessed. For days on end, I would complete tons of episodes, entranced by the plot, the characters, the fights, the emotional tug, and the sheer ecstasy I felt by seeing Naruto win over his battles. There is always something magical about seeing someone being shunned for so long find something greater than blank,
                  cruel stares. Yet, at the same time, I was too naive in the anime world. I had no way to compare such things as story, art, sound, etc. Naruto was the best because it was the only one.
Surprisingly, as I ventured into less well-known anime, my view of Naruto became a bit more critical. My initial amateur eyes that adored that yellow-haired boy and his adventures judged the not-so-amazing art, the lack of intense emotional appeal or response, and its amount of fillers (there are quite a few). The fact that Naruto was one of the so-called ""Big Three"" was enough for me; that in itself shot its rank up my list. That is, until I began to realize maybe it's so popular because it's quite an easy anime to accept? I am still not sure, but I do not want to deny it has been a good enough anime for me.
Story: 7/10
Just from the synopsis alone, anyone should be able to realize the story will have at least some depth in it. Beneath the usual light and comical air Naruto tends to bring on screen is a darker secret that he tries his best to hide his pain and loneliness. That already makes a powerful story, something many viewers can watch and learn from. Naruto teaches many lessons, especially about not giving up. Perhaps what makes it so popular is Naruto's continuous drive to find acceptance. So much of the anime revolves around that goal, but that then makes so much of it quite amazing.
I may be slightly judgmental here, but given the black/white nature of Naruto, there seems to be a bit of a skew. It is easy for the anime to be easygoing, but it seems to need something sad in order to develop its other side. That seems to be quite ironic because Naruto's life for a long time was one without friends and light. At the same time, I would understand it because in a way Naruto is trying to move on, but it just feels like the pain and suffering endured in the past is forced by their current circumstances (if that even made sense).
Art: 6/10
I realize if I reviewed this anime years ago when I first watched it, I would probably give it a 9 or 10. The art was not heavenly, the battles were not that epic (some were), and sometimes it just seems the artists did not put too much effort in. To summarize, I've seen better.
Sound: 7/10
Generally when I watch anime, I do not pay too much attention to music, but it does heighten certain feelings when played in the right time. Naruto does a good job, especially during moments of sadness. Those for me stand out the most. For the rest of the moments, though, the music just blends in. It is not particularly super, but not bad either.
Character: 7/10
Character development is pretty good. A lot of time is spent on main characters' pasts which add depth and understanding. Although not everybody gets their fair share on the spotlight, enough is given and explained.
Enjoyment: 6/10
I personally enjoy deep plots. Naruto had a focus on that, with its emphasis on Naruto's past suffering and pain, but at the same time the amount of deviation from its original standpoint somewhat irritated me. In other words, I didn't really like all of the fillers. Sometimes they provided more background, which was nice, but usually they were out-of-the-blue and did nothing to the storyline at all.
Overall: 7/10
Maybe if Naruto was the 5th anime I watched and not the 1st, it would have been ranked lower. However, I feel the beauty of this anime comes from its huge popularity. It's widely known throughout the world (probably), and that's what makes it unique. Sure it is not the best anime out there, but it does deserve some respect for being so... natural. It's one of the most natural anime out there. Give it a shot.",7

                ** I dropped the show at Episode 148 (13 episodes into the fillers)
+ A vast and interesting ninja world
- Terrible pacing (too slow) exploring the world and characters
+ Likeable characters with different personalities
- Sakura
+ Few characters are developed quite well (Sasuke, Gaara, Neji)
- Most characters remain one dimensional- Naruto is the typical bratty shounen MC with exemplary morals
+ A unique soundtrack that felt perfect
- Meh animation, though it is an old show
+ Chakra, element, jutsu system is interesting and creative.
- Most fight scenes are too long, filled with bad dialogue and flashbacks.
- Naruto may be weak, he may be a kid but he WILL yell at you and he WILL change your entire mindset.
+ Chuunin Exam Preliminaries
- Fillers
I watched 148 episodes in a week so despite its flaws I found Naruto enjoyable. It's a fine show but I'm starting to think shounen is maybe not my cup of tea.",5

                This review goes for both Naruto and Naruto Shippudden.....and all the 10 movies and 6-7 specials as well as the spin-offs. [no spoilers]
I've been through so many reviews saying naruto is an over-rated anime....
And they are not wrong. Perhaps naruto may be a little over-rated. Some say the story keeps collapsing, others complain about the animation, things don't make sense even to the supernatural and fantasy genre, flashbacks can be lengthy (it's more than in the manga), the number of fillers (I side them on this) are more than there should be.....so maybe Naruto is over-rated.....but why?
I know how they feel. I keep wondering what
                  was it that made people score Clannad, Spirited Away to the top 15 list (pardon for those who liked it).
Just like they speak so of these animes so compellingly, I shall speak a little so of this one:
There is something about the Naruto series that makes us just love it. Maybe it's the story which so cliched or unpredictably entertaining which doesn't want to make you miss a single episode, or the characters which are so much varied and contrasting making you laugh yourself out. Maybe it's the action which can make one thrilled and surprised at times, or the length of the series which you keep watching and eventually start to like it alot, like a normal song. Maybe it is the songs! People love it for some reason or maybe all of it. It just makes us feel so lovable towards it.
And it's not a first.
I've noticed there exist this category of animes that are usually action-based, supernatural, fantasy related with episode numbers exceeding hundreds and dozens of sequels and side-stories and a classic - Dragon Ball Z, One Piece, Bleach, Katekyo Hitman Reborn!, etc. etc., and of course, Naruto.
All of them may have so many minor or major flaws in them and may not make it to the top 15 or 50 list....but they are the ones which stays in our memories longer, no matter what your type of genre and likings are. Which while caught during flipping through channels many years later we wouldn't mind watching it for some time, no matter how senseless it feels then, which would make you say ""Aaaah the good ol' days, I loved this anime.""
Perhaps it's why they have so many more fans all over the world than haters and have their characters on every anime site you go too [and (sadly or not for some) have hentais made over them too ): ]
I watch them and sometimes even I notice the flaws in them and wonder ""maybe it is over-rated (fans are gonna kill me), but what the hell."" and I continue.
It's not worthy or un-worthy of your time. It's just plain enjoyable, thats all  : )",9
"
                This is the show that got me hooked on anime. 
STORY: I really loved the beginning of the story, including the training and exam. Since my favorite character of this series is Kakashi, I loved watching Team 7 go on missions and learning new tricks. I didn't like the story towards the end because I am not a fan of Orochimaru, even though he is pretty cool. 
ART: I loved the art most of the time, but since the art changes so much, there were some art styles I didn't like
SOUND: It is known to have one of the best soundtracks of all time for
                  a reason. The music is so good covers of the music get over 90 million views on youtube
CHARACTER: As I said above, I love Kakashi. The rest of the characters are great as well (except Sakura)
ENJOYMENT: I loved this anime and it felt like 200 episodes were over in a day. Super easy to watch
OVERALL: 9 because I like the storyline of shippuden a little better",10

                to those how are new to anime and have watched this are your first i wish to be the first to offer a apology for this will most likely turn you off the anime world
story: because this is a shonen jump anime/manga there is barely a story with most of it being filler this wouldn't be a problem if it was a random story anime like hetalia but seeing as it was meant to be a continuing story you will get turned off by the over use of switching story's and the over long episodes.
art: many might be turned on by the art style and
                  the look of the character however the animation will be a turn off when you realise that some of it were exact copys from other better done animes like this infamous one http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e86/CETAWS6/1256431478681.gif
sounds: the sound was not as annoying but it is very forgettable 
character: it's impossible for me to do this part with out using the words hate of f@#$ you anywhere. naruto is the main character but he's pretty much everything bad about anime rolled into one. he's annoying, he a complete douchebag, he's a loud mouth, and were suppose to like him. he's not the only annoying one in the show. sasuke is basicly the agnst type without any of the growing up. sakura is a annoying fan girl to the agnst so half her dialouge is ""oh sasuke, oh sasuke"" to be honest it's hard to say anything good about the character (with the exception of kakashi because he act's like a ninja. the perverted sage for being a perverted and the shy girl because she rarely talks). in other words i hate these characters
enjoyment: what enjoyment the anime is too fast paced and gives no room for anyone to breath in the show but there is nothing to breath in that's worth breathing
overall: AVOID THIS ANIME AT ALL COST. if your new to anime avoid it like the plaque this can most likely ruin anime for you! watch other anime's doesn't matter what just anything besides this!!",1

                I will repeat something that has already been said in other reviews: Naruto is the most overrated anime in history. Yes, but I will be honest in my analysis.
Story: Nothing to complain about, it could have been better, but it manages to be attractive and cool.
Art: I am not exaggerating, after all this is one of the few positive points that I see in the work as a whole: Art. There are characters with very beautiful features, of course, nothing complex and superior to other works, but analyzing Naruto separately, this is perhaps the only point worthy of a good note.
Sound Production: I think for
                  a lengthy anime, repeating the same soundtrack may be a bit overloaded, but I can not say that OST's are bad, on the contrary, they are always well-matched. Nothing complex, nothing out of the ordinary.
Characters: The reason for my 10th note to the characters is due to something that you will only understand if you watch the sequel: Naruto has good characters, and for an extensive work, he deserves admiration for not forgetting several characters. The characters are well spent, fun, charismatic and developed. In the final arc, we have the use of several characters that needed to be developed, and they end up being: Neji, Shikamaru, and others. Besides the lack of protagonism shounen in that part.
Enjoyment: Despite being a good work (note 8), it does not captivate much from one episode to another, ends up curling up in some parts, which discourages watching, but still worth it.
Overall: 8-This part of manga adapted in anime, deserves that note. It is not a very original shounen, the end is open for continuation, there are good characters that are used, and a work that, however it is not my favorite, is a good work!
I do not recommend the continuation, since almost everything I mentioned here is reversed in the continuation.",8

                This anime is about a ninja boy who dreams to be Hokage so the village will acknowledged him. He has a biju in him which is the Kyubi. He gets joined in a team with his crush Sakura and his rival Sasuke and his sensei Kakashi. This leads to meeting villains doing tourments like Chinnin Exams. The animations are good like the water, the character design. Everytime i hear a ost from here i get joy for the scene. Some characters are interesting like Orochimaru or Kakashi. Overalll i give it a 9

                Naruto is one of those animes that almost everyone knows about. It's so well known, that only in my country, it streamed in 5 different channels the entire first season. 
If you ask me to describe naruto with one word, it would be : COOL. 
Yeah this anime is cool. It's not so epic/dramatic/funny as other animes are, but for sure it is cool. What do i mean? Well i just loved the plot.. and for young teenagers, or even for more advanced ages, this anime can make you on the edge of your sit. 
Plot: 10/10. This is it. This plot is something amazing.
                  I can´t think about Naruto without thinking about a web. Yes a web. 
There is just so many things to explore, that when you start thinking about it, you get amazed. I watched this anime 4 years ago, and i still find it unbelievable. 
The originality is astonishing. I mean .. this is not just ninjas .. there is bunch of things that makes this anime so big in terms of content. What really impressed me, is the variety of powers. 
Here, on Naruto, you have a thing called ""Chakra"". You born with it. It's like your source of energy to use special skills. Then, depending on the person, the chakra can evolve up to 5 different types of chakra. For each type, there is tons and tons of abilities. Plus, there are special powers, that only some have, are transmited via DNA so only members of that clan can unlock those powers and you also have tons of different clans, so you have really a lot of things to look at. 
While in some animes you get bored because the plot ends up to be the same thing.. here such thing does not happen. There is just to many different types of skills that you will never get tired. There is always something to new to be shown. 
Plus, it's not just about skills and how many there are. It's also about the entire background story. The anime starts by telling that once existed a demon nine-tailed fox that attacked konoha(our main village), and moves 12 years later, and the journey begins.  
The plot at first. is simple and nothing great.. but with time, new things will be added, new characters will be introduced. Besides One Piece, this anime has the biggest cast i've ever seen. But unlike One Piece, when everything is forgotten at some point, here they are introduced and they stick with us until the end. 
When you realize the size of this plot .. well for me it's always a pleasure thinking about this anime. Nothing here is forgotten. Everything has a reason, everything has a explanation, and at Naruto Shipudden, you will realize how everything was connected since the beginning. 
They always move back and foward, so they really don´t stick with a time line. They often explore things deep into the past and by doing that, they always introduce new characters and new misteries to solve.  It is really an impressive plot. 
Art: 7/10. Well this anime is old, so either the background and the character design is not the best out there. Even though the animations are pretty well done for it's time. I really enjoyed the action despite of it's lack of detail. So i guess they didn´t failed that hard. 
The character design makes every single character unique, which for me is nice since there are animes out there were between the chracters, only the hair colour changes. 
And of course, this is a shonen so fan service takes place every once in a while. Personally i don´t dislike fan service, but for who does not like that, don´t worry. There isn´t to much. 
Sound: 9/10. The sound is engaging. It draws us into the action, which is such a nice feeling. Every single opening is well done. For the spirit os this anime (spirit of adventure) the openings are truly amazing. The tracks used are also great. They fit with the action, and they add something more to it. 
I would even say, the tracks used make this anime a litle bit epic when it comes to action. But well that is just my opinion. Anyways, i watched this anime 4 years ago and i still remember the openings and some tracks. So i guess they are memorable and so they are good. 
Character: 8/10. Well for a shonen .. we can not expect more. Pretty much standard characters. But take in mind. this anime was made almost 20 years ago, so back then, the cliche protogonist could not be so cliche as it is now.. Anyways the characters are enjoyable and almost all of them get a decent develop. It only fails when it comes to personalty and reactions. Unlike the plot, the characters are not that original, at least considering that nowadays they all are clichê. 
Enjoyment: 8/10. If there is one big problem .. is the comedy. Makes this show so childish and only breaks up the mood. The comedy is nothing more than stupid comedy, so it could be deleted from the anime that you wouldn´t miss it. Plus the last 2 or 3 arcs of this anime are fillers. I can´t ignore that. I didn´t watched it but they are there. I've only watched one arc, and it was so boring omfg .. 
The rest .. it's fucking amazing. I watched every single episode with a smile on my face of pleasure. Really enjoyable.. 
This show does not have an end.. it has a cliffhanger end to conect it with it's sequel, Naruto Shipudden. 
Overall: 8/10. Well i reccomend it ! I don´t give a crap about Naruto Shipudden, this show by it self is amazing and deserves a chance. You can skip and you may skip the fillers because they are useless. 
This show is a nice shonen, one of the best !",8

                Wow. I've been following the fandom and hype of this series for about four years now and i haven't managed to think up a review that encompasses the brilliance of Naruto. It's a staple in shounen jump and arguably one of the best animes of all time. All i can say, while avoiding spoilers, is that its a phenomenal series that everyone HAS to check out. If you're new to anime, then its also a great series to start off with. You may not love it immediately but 10 episodes in and you'll be hooked, i promise you that.
It's my favourite anime for so many
                  reasons. It just evokes so many feelings in you. You start caring about the characters so much and becoming so absorbed in the plot without even noticing it yourself. The world building is also so believable that it just makes you want to live it, despite the many sacrifices of being a ninja. Every character and every arc teaches you something new, if you only just stop to ponder.
The plot is insane. If you haven't read the synopsis, its about about a boy who hosts a demon fox spirit which is shunned by the entire village but is still determined to become hokage(the village leader).  Naruto is probably the only series i have watched where every arc is captivating and keeps you on the edge of the seats. The battle sequences are also nicely chereographed and well-thought out.  The plot is carefully woven and well-paced so there are no giant gaps between arcs. The so-called ''filler'' episodes are as funny and entertaining as the actual episodes and also contribute to the plot, rather than filling up screentime with mindless laughs, like other animes do.
My favourite thing about the series are the characters and their development. Despite having a huge cast, each character is still given his or her moment to shine and no one is left out. Naruto is a great protagonist. He's spirited and stubborn in the best way, refusing to give up on his goals no matter what the setbacks. Sasuke, sakura and kakashi are also well-characterised. Kakashi, in particular, was a character that i found interesting because of his aloofness and mysterious past. That's the best thing about the series. The characters are all so unique. You won't be able to find duplicates of anyone in naruto. Side characters also fit nicely with the plot and are interesting to watch. Another thing i like about the series is how the villains are treated. They are also given screen time to show their development and are not just mindless and one-dimensional. It's not just the good guys getting all the attention.
The artwork was beautifully done and was a great conversion from the manga. As for the voices, i prefer the english dubbed over subbed. I felt that unlike other animes, naruto's doubbed voice actors were casted brilliantly and even surpassed the japanese seiyuus, because their voices suited the characters better. They also didn't sound forced and contrived, like other series do, which was a plus.
Overall, i rate naruto an outstanding 10 because its the best anime i've seen to date and it will probably claim that number one spot for a really long time. Go watch it, if you haven't already. Check out the manga version too. You won't regret it.",10
"
                       Now, first off, I am not going to claim that Naruto is bad. I know a lot of people who would, but I won't. I also will not explain the plot, because once I start it gets hard to stop. What I am going to talk about is how Naruto lost me. It used to hold a very special place in my heart, because it was the anime that got me to look it up on the web, and finally discover what anime was and where to find it. I don't know how long it would have taken
                  for that to happen otherwise, but it was the catalyst. Back in the day I was a diehard Naruto fan. Now, I'm going to start with what is good about the anime.
     The action is very good, and while I generally prefer One Piece and a couple other anime in that department, it's still well done. The music is very good, and gets you ready for a good time. The best thing, easily, are the characters. The cast is large and there are quite a few stand outs. Rock Lee is a personal favorite, but almost all of the main cast are very well done. Naruto himself is a great protagonist. When they delve into his childhood, it really works. The Zabuza storyline is probably the peak in quality,  but the Chunin Exams/Gaara arc is my favorite. The ending fight works very well, though I've seen the same idea done better elsewhere. (Keep that in mind, I'll bring it up again in a couple of days.)
    Now for the bad. To start off, the problem with the great cast is that the writer has no clue how to focus. As time goes on, he spends less and less time with the initial cast that drew us in, and keeps throwing in new characters, only about one in ten of which are a fifth as good as the original characters. I don't want to spend more time with Sai, I want Hinata! For the anime the filler is atrocious, between Naruto and Shippuden literally a year and a half of filler. Some of it was good, but most was really bad, and because it was filler it was a year and a half where nothing of real importance could happen. Then there's the Sasuke problem. I didn't like Sasuke at first, but by the end of the Zabuza arc he had grown on me. But then the Sasuke retrieval arc reared it's ugly head, and now I can't stand the guy. And it got worse! Every time he's shown up since then he's made me more and more pissed. At one point it started to feel like Sasuke was supposed to be the protagonist, but luckily it switched perspectives again soon after. Plus, after the initial success of Zabuza and Gaara, I haven't liked the villains much. Orochimaru started off cool, but degraded fast. The Akatsuki didn't really impress me.
   The thing that gets me the worst though is the story. Over time, the plot has become more and more sidetracked and convoluted. It keeps going off-course, and not resolving what it's set up. Off everything that has happened so far, I think only the tailed beasts and Naruto's parents were things the writer knew when he started. Like I said earlier, the Gaara fight felt satisfying because it felt like it was built up to, and everything fit just right. I haven't felt that since, and that is a shame. Let me compare this with the anime I talked about yesterday, One Piece. One Piece set up huge plot points years in advance, in one case decades, and did so where it usually wasn't obvious that Oda was leading us there.",6
"
                This is one of my favorite animes that I've ever watched and obviously to be considered one of the big three of anime.
Characters: All the Characters of Naruto I love because they all are different from one another my favorite characters are obviously Naruto, Rock Lee, Shikamaru, and Neji. Just these characters alone show how great the show is also not only that the villains in this show like Itachi have in-depth storytelling that is fantastic. 
Story: The story itself is great following the boy Naruto Uzumaki on trying to be the next Hokage and the arcs in this show are amazing and are great
                  storytelling. my favorites include the village hidden in the mist, the chunin exam, and the Sasuke retrieval team. these in my opinion were the greatest arcs in the show.  
Art: The animation for this anime was incredible especially for the fight scenes blew me away with how well it was executed and the fights themselves kept you on edge sometimes and you never knew what could happen especially in the Chunin Exams.
Overall: I love this anime and highly recommend anyone this anime who wants to start getting into anime.",9

                Naruto is one of the most famous anime series of all time.(along with One Piece). Its called the number one series ever and is also said to be called a masterpiece. This is not true. Naruto is far from a masterpiece. Is it bad? No. Is is amazing? Far from it. Its just good.
Storyline7/10-NO SPOILERS-Naruto is a young boy who wants to be the be the best ninja ever by training with his teacher, Kakashi, and his two friends, Sakura and Sasuke. They train toghter and try to become hokage. Naruto and his friends also learn to fight with chakra and fight bad guys. The
                  idea starts off good, and is very enjoyable. However, there are WAY to many filler.(More then half the series is filler). Also, the pacing is very slow. It takes forever for arcs to finally finish. It is enjoyable at times, but does get old.
Characters4/10-This is the worst part of Naruto. The characters arent that good. Naruto, is annoying. He never gets any better, his jokes get old. Sakura is no better. Shes very weak(she gets better, but still isnt the best). The back storys are enjoyable, but it seems like it came out of a drama anime. Gaara is the best character. Hes very strong, and has a good story. Sasuke is good, like Gaara, but the others arent.(well, neji is pretty good). The characters are bad, not terrible, just bad.(they also never mature).
Soundtrack9/10-The OST is very good. I find it very enjoyable to listen to. The opening and ending themes are amazing. The battle music is epic. Naruto always had a great soundtrack. The sad music is beautiful. 
Art6/10-The art is fine. The character design isnt that good.(Expect for Gaara). The overall art look is decent. Ive seen better. I never think of it that much, because I never thought of it as amazing art. Just fine. Its good at some moments, however, it can be kinda poor.
Enjoyment7/10-I did enjoy it. This is a very enjoyable series. The soundtrack is what I enjoyed the most. The music, is just so enjoyable. Its beautiful. This is a anime also full of comedy. The humor is also what made me enjoy it. However, ive seen much more enjoyable series. There are things I didnt enjoy like terrible pacing, and filler. The enjoyment is good, but not great.
Overall7/10-Naruto was a series I enjoyed. However, its VERY overrated. Its called the best anime ever, but its not. The manga is much better. It cuts of all the fillers, better art, and better pacing. Read the manga. Dont watch the anime. It is good, but not number one.",7
"
                To be honest, I used to be obsessed with this anime. Literally. I would never watch any other AMVs besides the ones that included Naruto; I thought everyone who hated Naruto were idiots; I thought Sasuke was so hot, etc...
But the thing is, I only enjoyed it up until a certain number of episodes. The reason for this is, it got boring. In my opinion, anyway.
I think that they should've ended the anime at a certain spot. They shouldn't have put so many filler episodes, and Kishimoto shouldn't have made Naruto: Shippuden.
But, I do think the plot is great. It had a lot of potentional.
                  The characters were a bit cliche, but still enjoyable. The art could've been better, but it wasn't horrible.
I think the thing that ruined it for me, is that the story dragged on and on until finally they ended it to make a Naruto:Shippuden. Also, I was soooo into it that I guess I finally got sick of it.
Overall, this anime isn't horrible, but it's far from great. I do think that if you haven't seen it, you should still give it a try.",6
"
                This really isn't that great of a show, and if there was less focus on the side characters (like what happens in Shippuden) then it probably wouldn't even be tolerable to watch at all. The world-building and soundtrack carry the show on their back.
Naruto is the main character, and one of the most naturally gifted/talented/OP MCs of all time, entirely while the show tries to pose him as some weak underdog. The underdog that's never lost once. 
There are 2 entire seasons of filler episodes after the actual Finale of the show that aren't canon (or at least any progression gained is lost afterward, and
                  the main plot doesn't move an inch) 
Overall I would never recommend this show to anyone, it's definitely one of the bottom-tier shounen anime. The only reason to watch Naruto is if you've already seen it, and you have enough nostalgia for it to muscle your way through, or you want to watch it purely because of its legendary status and prevalence in media.",5
"
                Personally it is one of my favorite anime, it was the sixth anime that I saw, I want to clarify this, since many believe that ""Naruto"" is a childhood anime or as one of the first anime that have been seen and for that reason they brand it as overrated, I really don't think that way, I know people who have seen ""Naruto"" in his adulthood, and they really love it.
Well having clarified that point I would like to give my opinion about this anime and why you should give it a try.
*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*
This anime considers that it has many good values to
                  teach, the desire to improve yourself, the power of friendship, fight for your dreams and never give up, were the main ones. I also think that it can make you think about life and change your way of thinking. This anime teaches you that the world is not just black and white, there are gray tones, this can be seen referenced a lot in the ""villains"" that are in Naruto, these villains are not bad because yes, they all have a past, something that happened to them and I cause that they now have that way of thinking or being like that, that is why most people can sympathize with these characters.
Before I had said that ""NARUTO"" can change your way of thinking and make you reflect about life, which is true, at least in my experience it was like that, I am a very pessimistic person, I give up very easily, I don't have any reason to live or some goal that I want to achieve, this thought has led me to think if it was really important to continue living, it sounds stupid, but that is what happened. I cannot and could not live without having a goal, I needed something to do in my life, but there was nothing, I had already given up, I was only living day to day, I was already planning to commit suicide, I had planned to do it in about 10 more years , I was not happy with my life. But there was something that did not let me, I always had two thoughts that collide with each other, I have a negative side but also a positive one, unfortunately for me the negative was winning. All those thoughts flooded my mind, no matter how hard I tried to get out of that bubble of negativity, it didn't work.
Until I remember Naruto, how was it that a child who has a terrible childhood and life, that his parents are dead, I never get to know them, as if that weren't enough they died on the day of his birth, I mean your birthday is Important, one on those dates is generally happy, but knowing that your parents died on the date of your birth must be strong, it must be said that the people, the VILLAGERS, also blamed him (who at that time would be about 6 years old) of the death of the Hokage and the deaths of several more shinobi, all because a man wanted to control the Kyubi and take ""revenge"" against the village, causing the whole village to hate and despise a child who had not the slightest fault of this.
But despite that, Naruto never had a grudge towards people, no matter how bad they treat him, he always stays strong. He always looks to the future, he had a goal, a DREAM, which was to become a hokage of his village, with this people would not despise him, but they would value him as he really is, as a person, not as a monster.
I have always quite liked happy and pleasant people, his personality was and is perfect for me, I know he is clumsy and quite clueless, but his enthusiasm, his desire to live to fulfill his dreams, is the reason why I admire him so much.
That was one of the things that captivated me, his energy, his attitude, his personality, but what I liked the most is that he had a goal, he always had it, this caused in me two feelings, envy and admiration.
Envy because he knew that he could never be like him, he could never see the world with the same eyes that he sees them. I could never be happy like him. I could never have a dream, something that I am passionate about to continue with my life.
Admiration because I always wanted to be like that, to have his enthusiasm for the things that he is passionate about, the desire to learn new things and that despite having very difficult moments I never give up, it is not an option, no more.
I will not give up anymore, I still do not have a goal in my life, but that does not mean that I will lose, I will look for one, I will find something that I am passionate about. That's my goal, it's my ninja path.
I will fight for my goals, and when I find a dream I will fight even more.
I seriously know I recommend them too much if you are looking for something related to self-improvement, if you are going through a difficult time, especially in adolescence, where I am currently, I know that this process is complicated especially by mood swings or also confusing by hormones, in short.
Have you heard of Naruto evangelizing characters in anime? Well let me tell you that Naruto evangelized me, he took me off the path of evil, that it would lead my life to misery if I continued with those mindless thoughts in my head.
So I am very grateful to Naruto, I really love this series.
SO BOYS AND GIRLS FIGHT FOR YOUR DREAMS. DO NOT GIVE UP. FOLLOW YOUR WAY NINJA.",9
"
                The story line for Naruto was one that I'd never seen before. Kishimoto was very creative in creating an intricate world and background story for all of the important characters. The art isn't outstanding. But at time where the characters are engaging in battle you have to sit back and watch the great visual show. The characters in Naruto are of the most unique and well developed I've ever seen. Kishimoto is a specialist in the 'dreaded flashbacks' but those flashbacks make the characters we're watching so in depth that Naruto has become a phenomenon as cosplaying and especially fanfictions (which happens to be a
                  secret pleasure of mine)
Another point of Naruto that makes it very popular with your modern day otaku is the jutsu's. I praise Kishimoto's creative ability for creating jutsu's that play on characters different strengths, bloodlines and topology.
At times the plot can take far longer to unfold in the anime then it does in the manga which can lead to fillers. I believe that if Naruto had less fillers it would have more fans than it does. But for the true fans that find a character they can associate with (almost everyone can) Naruto is an enjoyable experience and is well on it's way to becoming a classic. 
The music for naruto also adds to the experience. The opening songs can be of the best and worst around. I know that I have a few personal favourites. The music during the program adds to the emotion of what is happening in the scene. It also seems that many characters have their own theme songs which is always entertaining.
Overall I give Naruto a 7 for a often heartwarming and heart wrenching story about an outcasts struggle to be accepted and never take no for an answer when it means reaching your dreams.",7
"
                A lot of people who have not watched Naruto have probably heard of how crap it is or how many fillers there are.
WELL. Naruto is probably as mainstream anime as you can get and as much as they drag the story on, I suppose it's quite necessary as they explain every aspect of every character's life. 
The whole story at first may seem to revolve about the main character, 'naruto', who wants to be the hokage of his village (hokage being the head/most strong ninja of the village), but as you get further into the story there are many minor arcs that involve all the
                  characters. Many moral values are portrayed through the anime such as friendship, betrayal, loyalty, courage and all your typical heroic values. Such as never giving up even though you're spewing blood from your mouth.
Though you should probably be prepared for the one fight carrying on for 10+ episodes, normal for any mainstream anime.
Overall, 8/10 :)",8

                NARUTO IS FIRE, one of the 1st shows I watched and I love it to this day. In my opinion one piece is better but the reason I like naruto more is because i watched it as a kid. But still I love naruto and my view on it will never change. I recomend you watch it if you havent. 
I gotta fit the mal word thing so NARUTO IS FIRE NARUTO IS FIRE NARUTO IS FIRE NARUTO IS FIRE , one of the 1st shows I watched and I love it to this day. In my opinion one piece is better but the reason

"
                Despite what filler haters say this anime is a masterpiece it had that something that made me wanna watch more and more of it even doe the animation at some point is pretty weak it's understandable, those haters who dont know how hard is to animate should keep they're mouths shut. It's harder making an anime that has fights in it than making an romance anime because depending on the character speed the need of drawings could increase in my opinion its easier to make tv series like the walking dead and the other tv series than anime anyway i deviated for the subject .
The
                  art was outstanding for an anime from 2002 its pretty good drawn except for ""I SEE YOU"" part fans will know what i am talking about
The story was great  beside the fillers the cannon was good and as a kid i loved the fillers too because they were actually funny.
The OST of the anime was amazing especially ""Need to Be strong"" 
The characters were portrayed pretty good everybody being unique in its way except for the disposable characters (Sakura which I was disappointed that she didn't die)
The anime was enjoyable as a kid I loved it, I had a pretty good childhood not like the nowadays cartoons 
Overall 10/10",10
"
                While I do agree that Naruto is the most overhyped anime in history, I can't deny the fact that there is some good in this original series. What made fans like me back then so interested in this anime was the main character himself, Naruto. In some ways a lot of people could identify with Naruto due to the lonely childhood he experianced when everyone in the village hated him for carrying a demon spirit inside him. This makes us feel pity for him, and also sets up his role in the series as the hated underdog who never gives up. Throughout this series Naruto
                  and his friends overcome harsh obstacles in their life after they are first introduced into the dangerous world outside their village. Their vulnerability and inexperience keeps us guessing and curious about how they overcome adversity from their foes, when faced with the battle of life and death. 
A perfect example of this would be the first arc of this story, The Land of Waves, as they travel on their first A-rank mission. When given the chance to return to the village, Naruto vows to carry on this mission by stabbing his hand after he was poisoned by rogue ninjas. This vow shows us his unwillingness to give in, even when it comes to puting his life on the line. This is the point where we start to admire the character and cheer him on throughout the rest of the story. The same types of character development can also be seen by the other two main role characters, Sasuke and Sakura. (Although after Sakura does develop an arc in this series, she does remain the same pitiful character throughout the rest of the series). Sasuke in particular, was also a character people could care about, because although we do know that he was the most skilled ninja coming out of his class, we also feel his pain and despair when his motivation is introduced later on in the series.
Other characters include Hatake Kakashi (the three character's sensei), and the surrounding cast of other ninjas in their class. Kakashi can be a well-liked character because of his past experience and leadership with the three, while the other surrounding cast can be just as likeable when they go through certain arcs in their life and eventually team up with the three main characters when a conflict arises.
Another good point that should be mentioned in this series is the music. This, in my opinion, is the most underrated part of this series. Songs like Sound and Strike and Sadness and Sorrow were key in exemplifying  the mood in certain action scenes, as well as scenes of sadness. This gets us more involved in the scene and interested in what happens next.
Unfortunately what brings this anime down to a 7 is the tedious and mediocre filler arcs that follow after episode 135. Since this anime closely follows the manga, there was a point where the anime eventually caught up, and had to wait for the author to pick up on his story. The result eventually led to the tedious story arcs that ran from episode 136 to 220. These arcs had no relation to the story or the characters as they continued to repeat the same plot elements from the previous arcs before them.
Although a lot of us can agree that Naruto Shippuden has taken this series downhill since (which is a darn shame), I do think that people should not overlook the original series, and at least try to watch it whenever they get the chance. There's a reason why it is well liked by many, and should at least be considered before looking at the colossal mess in Shippuden.",7
"
                This is the second anime I ever watched and going into it I didn't think I would like it. There were a few rough spots here and there like flashbacks (I almost quiet it because of them) but the characters and storyline definitely make up for that. 
The characters that the show had overall made the show even better because all characters had unique designs and powers and I really enjoyed learning about them all.
Many people criticise this brilliant show because of the amount of filler it has but that is easily avoidable if you just skip it as it has no real importance to
                  the story.
Animation was a bit rough in some parts but in defence of Studio Pierrot there budget was quite small when they started animating it.
This show definitely lives up to its hype and that's why I've given it a 9.",9
"
                This is one of some shows I really don't know why is so successful. I can only guess why: It was one of the few animes transmitted on the TV with an easy way to watch. I guess this because of it was the very situation on my country down to the last decades, so I think this is the overall situation. 
If you drink some soda, listen to some song or play some video-game, how do you know these things are good or not? Exactly, comparing with other products of the same type. If you have no others products to compare, you will probably
                  find anything great, because it's a pure type of innovation in your life. I'm almost sure it was the reason Naruto became so popular. 
Naruto is just one of the many commercial crap released with no clue of creativity, if you watch like, Hunter x Hunter before it, you'll easily note the elements recycled to that. Took as example the main character: a good smiley pre-teenage boy with a big dream, how cares a lot about the people around him and is kinda of an idiot. Then you have a cool-head fellow with a serious expression and a dark past. 
OK, it already is a very big resemblance, but does it end here, right? Nope. Although it does end in the main characters, you'll see many others resemblances in others characters, like antagonists, tutors, aged men, etc.
You may think ""resemblances are natural in those types of work because the authors have inspiration and hall"" wait, it doesn't end here, only in the characters, despite we getting two exactly looking characters at the very beginning, it has already to many others ""resemblances"", as we say. What about the routes the plot takes? Our brave kids go trough a lot of ""similarities"" in a way it's kinda of very scary. We got to see them going to doing a time-limited test to take an object from an obviously stronger adult; we got to see them doing an exam to graduate to the job they need to, which you'll see them passing through quest-based games, individual fightings and a time-limited contest that you need to get some objects from other competitors, then get out of the demarcated area, that has some extravagant animals besides the other competitors who will make your objective very much difficult. 
Although, not everything is the same. Naruto also tries to discern in some cases, but then we get some horrible things: the author tries to write deep characters, I know it, but the think is he don't know how to do it, the maximum he could do was putting distinct characteristics at unidimensional buildings. It's not an horrible move, in fact, is one of the most things shounen writers do. The horrible thing about it is the constant need to rub that in our faces. WE ALREADY KNOW HOW MUCH NARUTO SUFFERED, WE ALREADY KNOW HOW HATRED SASUKE IS, WE ALREADY KNOW HOW DETERMINED LEE IS BESIDES OF NOT HAVING NINJUTSU, DAMN. 
Another horrible thing about the show is how lazy Kishimoto tries to settle the conflitcs up: it's just: fighting, fighting, more fighting, Naruto crying about it's past, fighting, Naruto gaining a lot of power from the legendary creature inside of him to win the fight, ok, this over, everyone happy now. 
Summing up: this show is a huge caught in the hurricane plot with no creativity at most part, and when tries to create something original, it ends up boring, repetitive, painful to watch and a pure waste of time.",2
"
                I see alot of reviews on here attacking the ""fanboys"" and how this show is not any good. Those people who are so aggressively against naruto are the exact opposite of the fanboy and there arguments are bias in the other direction. Due to that fact, they also cant be trusted. 
An honest review of Naruto should be mostly positive because the show is pretty good at alot of things. To start, the world building in Naruto is fantastic, the shin-obi world that has been created is interesting and unique. They also capitalize on that world building by making what seems like realistic decisions and
                  not going overboard. So the story focuses on a determined little boy named Naruto, who lacks talent but makes up for it with his spirit and guts. Naruto might not be the most interesting character but he is love able and I found my self rooting for him to succeed. The rest of the characters are pretty like able and the story does a good job of fleshing each character out and making them feel real. The plot is interesting in its twists and turns, while the motives of Naruto and his friends seem genuine. Where the show falters are in battles, or at least the battle scenes, which are predictable and take an overly long time. Characters often are found talking to eachother and experiencing flashbacks during battle which really can get tiresome. The battles can be interesting at times but too much of the times your thinking ""JUST FIGHT ALREADY!!!"" Also seeing the same flashbacks over and over can be annoying and it just seems like a way to extend episodes. 
Overall though Naruto succeeds at pulling you in and making you care about the characters. Even though the battles can seem tedious, you stick with it because you're anxious of the fate of a character you've grown to love. Also don't complain about fillers, just skip them and you'll be fine.",8

                IT IS POPULAR FOR A REASON!
I just re-watched this show two months ago, so I'd thought I should review it.
When I first watched it years ago, I remember gradually falling in love with it. Asides from Yu Yu Hakusho, this was the second anime that grabbed my attention. I really did not like it at first. I thought it was boring, sexy/harem- jutsu annoyed me, and Haku's gender confused me! I think what grabbed me to this show was Zabuza's final speech. That whole scene was brilliantly emotional, and I automatically became hooked.
That being said, it takes a while to fall in love with this
                  show (it starts off really good though), and then it takes another while to fall out of love with it. But do I recommend this anime? Yes, that is considering you have the time to watch, you are patient, and realize that there is another series (Part II) after this. The show does not really end.
The soundtrack for this anime is amazing!  In my opinion it's unique, not classical,  and better than what you expect! That's all I can say about it.
The art gets better as the story progresses especially the fighting sequence. Unfortunately, I cannot say this about Shippuden (Naruto: Part II).
As for the characters, after you watch a lot of anime, you realize how unoriginal they are. There is nothing special about them. However, when I first watched it, I remember having a very difficult  time deciding who my favorite character was going to be because I thought all of them were amazing. Now, I cannot stand most of the characters.
Naruto: the main character is alright. His perseverance is very admirable. The only problem I have with him is that he is dull-witted; but even that is a gateway to bring humor into the show. I’m glad he is the hero of this series because he does bring the good emotional side of everyone.
Sasuke: He is the reason why I hate characters that are so emotional. That ""cool-dark"" vibe does not appeal to me. It is over used! He is the definition of a psychotic masochistic-emotional loser! I just want to slap him. It gets worse as the episode goes on. I did even not understand how all the girls love him. Speaking of the girls, how come they are all ridiculously vacuous? 
Saukura: If she is the smartest out of her classmate, there is something really wrong with the people there. All she does is love Sasuke. She is mean to everyone else. Furthermore, there are moments that she does have character development, BUT right afterward she is just annoying again: A FAIL of a heroine.
Haku- he is not a main character, but I remember having an argument with my family about whether he was girl or a boy. It really did start a riot in my house. It was a mind boggling moment in my life. I swear! This was before I realized that Japanese anime always has at least one male character that speaks and looks like a girl. However, it is still surprising that the English dub kept the female voice. 
As for the other characters such as: Neji, Hinata, Kakashi, Gaara, Lee, Choji, (and so many more!)are developed really nicely. I love them! All of them have similar traits to Naruto, but they are different and beautiful
Lastly, I want to speak about Shikamaru! The laziest character of ‘em all.  To be honest, I had never seen a character like him before when I started watching, so he fascinated me (now I know, there are so many of them). I feel like out of all the characters, he had the best character development even though he was not a part of all the episodes. It was done perfectly as well. The laziness still lived on, but the maturity starts revealing itself. He is what you call intelligent, not Sakura
Lets just say, as  cliche as the characters are, their (heartbreaking) storyline makes the show.
What do I hate about Naruto?
It doesn't end. There are so many fillers (pointless episodes that do not relate to the storyline). A person can only watch so much! I must have been really stupid, because when I started this show, I LOVED the filler. However, it took so much out of me that I could not even watch Shippuden. 
If you are going to watch the show, do not watch the fillers! DO NOT WATCH IT!
The only fillers that you should watch are the ones that you like. Research the episodes before you begin. I loved episode 101: Kakashi's real face. It was a question I was thinking about since the beginning of the anime, so it was interesting to know that the characters thought about it too! And the Neji's curry episode was funny as well.
If you are a Hinata, Neji, Sjhikamura, Kiba, Ino, (or whoever), there are specific episodes related to them, so just watch those only, nothing more. There are more than 100 fillers I believe, soo..... don't. watch. all of them.
Overall, this is only a review for Part I.. believe me, if I had to talk about the manga or Shippuden, the rage would ooze out of your computer screen. Okay, not really, but I would have more negative things to say even though I like it.",7
"
                this anime was a masterpiece. ive seen 100s of anime read about 1000 manga titles. honestly i do have to admit naruto was my first anime and that could cloud my judgment but ive watched naruto like 4 times after that. i finished rewatching it for the 4th time about a month ago. its still the best. if u think otherwise Kys (pls dont). in all seriousness if u havent seen naruto i reccomend u go watch it its a 10/10 in my book, and hopefully it will be the same in yours.
the review still isnt long enough wth just let me post the review
                  DAMN!!!",10
"
                this is my first review so i thought i start it with the first anime (besides pokemon) that i have watch Naruto. i used to love naruto when i was young being hook on to every episode, waiting eagerly for the next one to come out. it was a good anime and i think it a great anime to first start watch anime. now that my options is out lets start the review.
story- The story is about a boy named Naruto who has a nine tail fox seal in him has set out to become the Hokage of the leaf village. i kind of like
                  the story because it was so simply even a 6 year-old child would have figure it out in the first episode.(this it true ask my cousin if u don't believe). the story was great until it got to sakuke turning evil, after that it was just crappy fillers. i personally didn't like filler because it get us off track of the real story that is happening. i think i end it here.
art- The art in this anime was nothing to be excited about. there is nothing special about it. it will not make you jump out your seat or bed surprised. its just decent. i also think that the artist was either lazy when he did some episodes or he was messing with us.like that time during the Chunin exams when sasuke's forehead was huge. i think he was trying to make us laugh and it worked cause i was lmao.
sound- Sounds were great and incredible. the voice actor done a great job with this anime and music were pretty awesome. most of the OP and ED were great and i actually listen to it enjoyment without skip it. and my favorite of all was the backgrounds music play during every sad moment made me almost cry.(almost)
characters- the character in Naruto are good but the problem is that the character development sucks. naruto is still the cocky and stupid kid who trys his best, sakura is still a useless and bitchy girl who still in love with sasuke. finally sasuke who i think did a little development from emo to Super Emo.
enjoyment- Naruto is very good anime to begin first watchig anime. naruto has that addiction that make you want to see the next episode a soon as possible. the fighting scene were the most enjoyable to watch. and even though it had alot of crappy filler i did find a couple that were good.
overall this is a good anime with some of the best music i ever heard and i'm saying this because it was the only thing i thought was really good. you should started watching this if you haven't because this anime waits for no one
first review finished",7

                Oh boy, Naruto. I remember being really into Naruto as a kid. I started watching it again around February to get into Shippuden. And you know what? I loved it. The anime is amazing. Amazing story and characters, amazing soundtrack, the art is good (nothing too special, just good) and really just enjoyable. The plot twists are good, character development feels natural. I really like how characters don't just get powers for no reason and get super powerful out of nowhere. They develop and train gradually which makes it more believable in a sense. But then, at one point, the anime went into 84 episodes
                  of fillers. Now, now, I know some would say ""Then just don't watch them"" in which case I'd say ""But they are still part of the anime!"" In that case, I'd just read the manga. That has no fillers. Really, before the LONG filler period, I'd have given this anime a 9/10. It was amazing. Not super complicated and a bit cliched but I still think it did its things well. Hell, I was okay with the first 20 fillers or something but they got WAY too much after that. It was torture. 
Now, the story is good. Non-filler episodes have a pretty good story. As I said, the plot twists can be pretty good. The pacing can be slow, like that episode when they did a recap of all that happened previously for no reason. I'll admit that this anime can make you feel really sad when it wants to and can make you laugh at other times. But not the fillers. There are few good fillers. Those are indeed funny and can even be alright stories. But most of them are so PAINFULLY cliched. They tend to use the exact some plot points we've already seen. The stories repeat themselves and are dreadfully predictable. The whole filler thing ruined how the original anime should have ended. The characters are also pretty good. However, they can be definetely a bit samey to some people as some complain about a lot of them having tragic backstories (like, A LOT). However, it isn't much of a problem for me as I love a lot of the characters personally. There are some that are pretty weak, though, a lot of whom tend to be female characters (Gosh, Ten Ten sucks, that's just what I wanted to say. Sakura as well) Then the fillers screwed that up.  Most of those characters follow either one of these patterns: dead parents, monster inside, boy turns out to be a girl etc. It's awful really. Which makes the story just good, as well as the characters.
In terms of sound, Naruto is amazing in that regard. I really like the voice acting and the soundtrack is beatiful. There are a few tracks and voice actors who aren't all that great but it's nothing too serious. The art is generally good, considering the time period. It definetely isn't the best nor does it need to be.
Overall, Naruto is a good anime. The first half of the anime is amazing, before the whole filler thing started, then it went into crap territory, hence why I had to drop my score by 2 points. That's because there are still some good fillers and the first 20 are bearable and the fact that before them, the anime was amazing (even if they love flashbacks a bit too much).",7

                Believe in the Naruto that believes in you... that’s what Kamina said at least, right?
Naruto is iconic. With all the Naruto-running, cropped pictures of Sasuke being choked, and the forgotten classic of “Tobi is a good boy” memes that have laced the Internet, this the Digital Age is not without its Naruto influence and perhaps even bigger to people today than what Dragon Ball was to the generation prior. I wouldn’t be surprised if at least 10% of all zoomers have seen some form of Naruto in their life too. It’s an anime that deserves to be experienced. 
If it wasn’t already apparent, I love
                  Naruto. Naruto was one of the first anime I remember watching where I was aware what I was watching was just that. I would even credit the show for lifting my fascination for Japan and all things anime off the ground too. Going from staying up late with friends to catch the latest weekly episode on Toonami, to going to the Naruto website to catch the latest subbed episode, to reading the manga, and rewatching the show over and over again as the years went on. But over those years I’ve slowly become disillusioned with the it all; Naruto quickly became one of the more contentious shows I’ve groan to know.
I have to say though, from the get go, what I appreciated about Naruto conceptually, ever since I first tuned into the show, was how it managed to subvert viewers through its premise. Knowing its creator, Masashi Kishimoto, originally had in mind to write his now highly-acclaimed, modern classic manga as a story that happened to revolve around shinobi arts as a vehicle to depict the value of friendship, it’s incredible in the amount of world building put into the it all, stringing together all sorts of East-Asian lore, mythology, and history to make up much of the inspiration. Instead of mercenaries set in a traditional, Edo-period Japan, we instead get a group of teenagers graduating from an academy to achieve their genin status depicted in a brand new ninja universe. All of that in mind, I’d go as far to say the world in Naruto is one of my favorites in any show.
That brief mention about teenagers attending an academy? That’s only relevant for the first three episodes — arguably one. It’s funny how often I remember Naruto as a show about students attending a ninja academy when it’s not even near the core of the show itself. Instead we have students broken up into squads of four, consisting of three just-graduated genin and one jonin, the highest rank of shinobi, and it’s this dynamic we will be used to. Having the show revolve around a squad and not a room full of students at a school allows for more freedom in the story for our characters to move and a better chance for us to learn about the world through action. 
Like most shounen, action anime/manga, there is a power system in Naruto: chakra. Chakra is energy stored in all shinobi for which they utilize it through intense rigorous training and allows them to active various forms of jutsu. This power system, although better thought up compared to Dragon Ball, but one that’s not as well managed or balanced as Hunter X Hunter. More on that later. The different jutsu shinobi can learn and use include the three basics: ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu. There are also other, specific techniques like fuinjutsu which is a sealing style of jutsu meant to lock or unlock words, people, or chakra amongst other things into scrolls and paper tags. There are even techniques only specific individuals can utilize, being kekkei genkai. These are hidden techniques known only to specific clans or otherwise other passed down through their bloodline. One such example is doujutsu, an “eye” ability that, if they possess the correct eyes, can perform unimaginable abilities. Having chakra, as well as the focus, allows a shinobi to walk up walls and on water. There is a huge rabbit hole of information regarding the different shinobi arts and reading about it online is just as interesting as watching ten show itself, if not more.
However, the gripe I have about this system is there isn’t any clear way distinctly knowing how much chakra someone has or how much is used up. Sometimes you’ll see characters fatigued or will straight up say they’ve used up all their chakra but you’ll find that any character can get around this through convenience or outside circumstance. No more chakra to use on your opponent? No problem, just run out of the way, perfectly throw a target, or have a neighboring ally save you from harm. If all else fails, just give it a little bit of time and you’ll suddenly regain enough chakra to use soon after.
Jutsu get pretty ridiculous from time to time too. Although not nearly as bad as the power creep would get in Shippuden, moments where Kakashi and Zabuza, an incredibly skilled mercenary and Jonin that’s said to be just as powerful as Kakashi, are shown making hand signs, lasting around 10 seconds or so to do, in order to summon two giant dragons made from water out of a nearby lake, and that’s the only time you see a sequence as detailed as that. Every time characters do hand signs, time is not nearly as spent on the action and newly graduated Genin are able to do this while fighting off the enemy. Sure these are not just teenagers but ones that have gone through years of training to be able to do any of this, but it downplays the nature of battling with jutsus and sooner than later you find nearly every single fight is primarily a battle with magical powers. Again, thankfully this isn’t so much a problem in the OG Naruto show as it is in Shippuden, but the leniency of not having a tighter grip on the power system and the powers that come from it create too much risk for something out of control.
Our main cast consists of Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, and Kakashi, and for sake of brevity will focus more on than their importance’s to the show itself. The characters themselves, although not anywhere near the most original I’ve seen (especially for a shounen), share a strong distinction from the other, complementing each other’s strengths. The primary colors are often paired with green, for a fourth color like in the Opponent Process theory, and our main cast members all distinctly fit into each color (with a secondary color to boot), setting them apart easily when together and allowing room for their personalities to shine more. Naruto has both yellow and orange to emphasize hope, energy, and a bright future. Sasuke has a deep blue and black to contrast Naruto especially as well as show his dark and dejected past. Sakura having red and pink to represent the passion and love she bears. And Kakashi in a green and white which tells us how calm and focused he is towards his life and his students. It’s a simple yet effective way of storytelling, further preparing us for who shares the screen.
The side characters to any show are only as strong as their mains and thankfully this show has plenty of good ones. There are several other squads that graduated from the same academy Naruto came from and each have their own distinct personalities as a squad. Unfortunately, every character outside of the main four have muted color schemes but up close you’ll notice their cool individual designs. Each character has an unmistakable style or “gimmick” to them and it makes for interesting scenarios for when they’re on the battlefield.
Growing up and entering middle school around the time I was first watching Naruto, I fell in love with most of the characters found. I was enamored with their dynamics and interaction both in and outside a fight. It was like having a awkward, fogged up view of what being a teenager could be like... only without the ninja stuff. What’s unfortunate is those characters I loved would only appear for a certain number of episodes and then later, when that arc would end, would never be seen again until the next arc, if that (sorry Ten-Ten fans). As hopeful as one could be, not every side character is given the same treatment as another. Some are treated like temporary main characters, others barely have any lines. It’s as if Kishimoto doesn’t know what to do with them aside from being window dressing, with more screen time given to some in some of the ops and eds rather than the actual episodes (again, sorry Ten-Ten fans). 
Something Naruto does well though is how they handle their arcs. They are recognizable from each other and last for a long while, so unfortunately if an arc doesn’t excite you, it can come off like a drag sitting through it. Naruto, for better or worse, has two really great arcs, The Chunin Exam arc and The Retrieval arc. Every arc Kishimoto creates can be split into sections, which make for an exceptional way of handling them, but the two in reference are well beloved by fans for good reason, as they do an exceptional job in its overall content and refreshing narratives compared to some other long-running shows. I’ll admit that getting through some arcs feel a little “meh” than others, but I’d argue they at least hold a lot of significance and maintain an identity all in itself and the progress you see Naruto and co. go through. All in all, it’s a net positive in the arc department. 
Now, I gotta focus on the negatives, because if there is something I think Naruto doesn’t get enough flack for is its pacing. Naruto has filler, an ass load of it, but even during canonical episodes you will witness poor pacing that cuts the seams in the production schedule. Showing anyone this show, at this day of age, can be cringe inducing. Having to sit their with your significant other as you watch all the characters stand around for nearly a minute as the scene pans around, closes in on everyone’s reactions, and zooms in on a single still shout of the “action” itself. Hearing a chuckle accidentally release from a confused viewer, I am reminded we are watching mediocrity and not something with proper heart and creativity put in. If the show isn’t randomly inserting filler in the middle of an arc, then it is bogging down the episode by stretching out its moments, contributing to the horrid pacing. Not every episode is like this and several fights in here I’d argue are among some of the best fights in anime ever, but that’s only a fraction of what makes up the bulk of this show. 
I mentioned it before, but Naruto is plagued with its filler content. If you’re wanting to pick this show up, just know it is quite the undertaking. I already mentioned one of the shows to precede Naruto, being Shippuden, but the other is Boruto, which is a spin-off taking place after the events of Shippuden, so to get the complete Naruto animated experience you not only will have to complete 220 episodes from here, 500 episodes of Shippuden, maybe the 11 films sprinkled here and there, and the currently airing Boruto: the Next Generation which is sitting at 185+ episodes as of this writing. I’d honestly pit a good argument that it’s more of a journey getting through all the show than our titular character has ever experienced.
So, how much filler are we talking here? Well, firstly, I will admit that I too, sometimes, will not give my full attention to a show for every single moment it graces my screen. This is mostly due to the lack of time I have to enjoy to myself outside of when I’m working and would rather indulge in multiple outlets. So the idea of someone not committing to giving their full attention to the filler in Naruto is understandable, but it’s still questionable. If you consider the 720 episodes of Naruto and Shippuden combined, there are 425 episodes that are canon to the manga. That’s 59.03% that is actually related to the story being driven. Just slightly over half of the animated television material is worth consideration of being absolutely crucial in the eyes of many fans.
Something that’s far more common than I expected for new fans of the show to do is follow a PDF, usually one found somewhere online, that list the different episodes dedicated to being filler, and skip those episodes. And that’s the problem. If a show has way too much filler that you’re willing to skip, perhaps that says a lot about the product itself or maybe the viewers that skip it all without question are hesitant to admit the show’s shortcomings. Perhaps that overall rating isn’t deserved? Hmm..
I’m actually a fan of filler. For the most part I’ve never really minded it before or after knowing whenever I’ve watched any too. Naruto, for a majority of the time, has some good filler. There is some bad filler, in fact, literally the second episode in the series is a filler episode. That episode is a bad and annoying episode, and while we are at it, if you’re about skipping episodes, you can probably just skip the first two episodes as the third episode makes for an amazing pilot episode and is one of my absolute favorites in the series, but that’s neither here nor there. Many that have watched the filler with agree that the episode involving Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke trying to see what’s under Kakashi’s mask is an example of good filler. Although I personally don’t care for it, as it’s a bit too slapstick and tonally separate from much of the show, it’s at least a bit of proof that there is value in watching them. The Land of Tea and Land of Rice Patties arcs are two of my favorite sets of filler episodes that I think every fan should watch. Of course, many will still skip the filler as it’s a matter of principle and finishing the show as quickly as they can without being bogged down by events that are inconsequential regardless of the entertainment value.
The art is both and hit and a miss. For the time it looked pretty good, but nothing stellar. Watching it now I’m able to notice more of the shortcuts the animators made when producing the show. Kishimoto has even expressed concern over his drawing abilities over time when illustrating. The show does have its fair share of sakuga, particularly in certain high stakes moments in anticipated fight scenes. 
But if there is one thing every Naruto fan CAN agree with it’s that Naruto has some of the best collection of ops and eds on the market. To me, Naruto felt like it was always trying to one up itself and change its theme music to not just keep us in tune for when a new arc/section of the show begins and ends, but just because it could. Naruto had the clout to justify its seemingly rapid output of ops and eds and each one sticks with you in some way. You could probably learn a lot about a person judging solely on which Naruto op and ed they favorite the most.
Looking into everything, I’ll admit this show can be a fun ride and not even me at my most cynical, not even me after binging Neon Genesis followed by Angel’s Egg, not even me with a partner at my side could intellectually tear this Show down by saying it’s not fun. Because Naruto can be fun to watch. It’s a show you can easily get lost in. I didn’t want to focus on any spoilers but there’s plenty to nitpick there, but I can still understand why someone could like the show regardless. As essential this show is to experience, at this point in my life, if pacing/filler is an issue for you I cannot in good conscience recommend someone sit through at this show. Again, I believe it’s essential but you’d be better off lurking online for information regarding the show rather than be disappointed trying to commit to the entire thing. If you decide to check it out and watch a few episodes , I think you’ll know right away if you’re going to like this show and want to stick with it in the long run. I may have a hard time liking Naruto, but I still love it.",7

                Out of all the long-running Shounen series that are out there, to me, one stands above the rest. Even though I only watched this anime recently, it holds a special place in my heart as my favorite long-running action anime that I have ever seen, and for good reason. 
Story:
One of the main problem’s that plagues a lot of long-running Shounen’s is their ability to keep an interesting narrative throughout the entire run time of the show. They make it interesting by having the show made up of many different arc’s that each have their own stories, characters and problem’s that the characters must face.
                  A lot of these arcs are self-contained stories that don’t do much for the plot, despite the quality of some arcs. Naruto, doesn’t really do that. While each arc does have their own problems that the characters face the overarching story and the reason these events are happening tie in to the constant narrative that plays throughout the whole show. The plot is always advancing and not once is it ever boring to watch since the characters are always growing and learning different things about their friends and the world that they live in. Normally, if I would ever review any long-running Shounen’s in the future, this would be the section where I do mini reviews of every main arc in the series, but considering the whole show plays out like one big narrative, it’s almost impossible for me to do that. 
The main story itself is compelling enough that it doesn’t feel like reason just to get cool characters to fight it out (Which is the vibe I’m getting from Bleach from my experience of watching it so far. The story in Naruto is always expanding, new characters get introduced, new villains emerge and while a lot of the events in this series are set up for what’s to come in Shippuden (Especially in the Sasuke Retrieval Arc) it’s still worth watching to see where the characters grow and mold into the people they are later in the story (I say this because it seems quite a few people skip this series and start with Shippuden). 
Not everything is flawless in this department, however. Naruto is notorious for having insane amounts of filler episodes and this show is one of the biggest offenders of this problem. It starts off harmless enough by having a recap episode, then a hot spring episode, a fun episode about Kakashi’s face and a five-episode arc about a race which would be fine if that was all it was. Instead of ending the show at the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, the show continues into 85 episodes of filler! Even for a long-running show like this one, 85 is an insane amount of filler episodes to have in a row. They even start the filler, right when the story was about to make it to the time-skip. While it was done to wait up for the manga, they could have just ended the original series and waited until they had enough material to start making Shippuden. Instead we got 85 episodes of low-quality random ninja missions that are close to unbearable to watch. I made it through the first few episodes of the first filler arc when I decided to stop and skip to the final episode. Even though this problem can be avoided now since you can just skip these episodes, it only really bugs me when I think of how long fans had to wait until the filler ended back when these episodes were airing. It may not be a problem now but it gets annoying when it still plagues Shippuden. But as I said before, you can just skip them now (Which is the most recommended option). So, in terms of the story department, Naruto does an excellent job considering all the filler is skippable. 
Characters:
For long-running Shounen battle series, it is important to have cool, likable characters that make up the cast. No matter how cool the battles are, they won’t matter if you don’t care about who is fighting. Luckily, this is where Naruto shines the most. Naruto, as the protagonist of the story, does a great job to make the viewers root for him. Being the ultimate underdog, Naruto aims big in this series and is where the main emotion comes from throughout the show. He’s a boy that has nothing, that aims for everything. His relationship with the other main characters, his rival and best friend Sasuke, his love interest Sakura and his teacher Kakashi is what really drives this show and is what made this show so popular in the first place. As Naruto bonds with these characters you see him grow from being the village loser to their strongest ninja by doing nothing but making friends and working hard to get stronger. His struggles are relatable and his goals make sense for a person like him. At first, he causes trouble because he’s alone and he thinks that everybody hates him. But by meeting his new squad and bonding with other ninja, he becomes aware of how special friendship is and how you need bonds if you’re going to be Hokage (which is the head of the village).
Apart from Naruto, the cast is made up of the coolest and craziest character’s I’ve seen in any anime. I already mentioned Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi but some of the best characters come in the form of rival ninja teams or the crazy villains that the heroes face. Among my favourites are Rock Lee (the lovable goofball), Shikamaru (the lazy genius), Hinata (the very shy, true love interest), Neji (the vengeful prodigy turned ally), Temari (this one is biased since she is my favourite female character) and Gaara (the frightening villain turned greatest ally). Even characters that I didn’t like at first like Ino, Choji, Kiba, Kankuro and Orochimaru turned out to be some of my favourite heroes and villains. But the best character (apart from Naruto himself) is Naruto’s perverted teacher, Jiraiya. Jiraiya is probably one of the most important characters in the series, mostly because of the impact he has on Naruto. While his squad leader Kakashi is training Sasuke, Naruto heads to Jiraiya who teaches him the Rasengan which becomes Naruto’s signature move and becomes Naruto’s father figure throughout the rest of the series. He’s motivation for Naruto to not give up and to continue moving forward with his dreams and ambitions. While I could continue with characters like Tsunade, Kabuto and Itachi, I’ll end this segment here by saying that out of all the other categories, Characters is what Naruto excels at the most.   
Sound:
The soundtrack is amazing. The songs are a nice mix of traditional Japanese music mixed in with bad-ass guitar. The Main Theme of the series is one of the most memorable, iconic and beautiful pieces of music to anybody that’s seen this show. If you haven’t heard it, you owe it to yourself to listen to it since it’s probably the most amazing song in the whole soundtrack. In terms of Openings and Endings, Naruto proves once again that just because it’s a long-running Shounen, it doesn’t need to half-ass it’s theme songs. Every Opening is a memorable J-Rock tune and not one of them is bad. It’s hard to pick a favorite from these songs which is why mine is a three-way tie between Haruka Kanata (OP 2), GO!!! (OP 4) and No Boy, No Cry (OP 6). The ED’s, while not as good as the OP’s, are still good and get the job done as Ending songs. Wind (ED 1), Viva Rock (ED 3) and Ima made Nando mo (ED 5) are my favorites while the others are still good, but not the most memorable. 
While I haven’t heard the Japanese voice acting since I watched the Dub, I can still judge the Dub and my god, is this a damn good Dub. Every voice actor hits the mark with every character they play. Maile Flanagan does an amazing job as Naruto and Yuri Lowenthal (who is one of my favorite voice actors) does one of my favorite performances from the show, as Sasuke who is one of the most iconic characters from the show. Tara Platt also does an amazing job as Temari considering that her performance is one of the main reasons that I like Temari so much. Other notable performances are Steven Blum as Zabuza and Orochimaru, Steve Stayley as Neji, Stephanie Sheh as Hinata, David Lodge as Jiraiya and Liam O’Brien as Gaara. Every other performance of the other main characters was also great but those were some of the best ones that were worth mentioning. If you couldn’t tell, Naruto also does a great job in the Sound department. 
Animation:
Now to some of Naruto’s low points. The best way to describe this show is by saying that you’re basically watching an animated manga with a few great examples of amazing fight animation. While this isn’t Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters levels of barely animated, it’s noticeable considering there are a great number of shots that either linger or are completely still. Despite that, every fight in the show (and there are quite a lot) is always interesting to watch and is never boring to watch. The lack of animation during the dialogue sections of the show is made up for by the great animation for a lot of the fight scenes. Battles like Neji vs. Hinata, Rock Lee vs. Gaara, Naruto vs. Gaara, Naruto and Jiraiya and Tsunade vs. Orochimaru and Kabuto, Rock Lee vs. Kimimaro and Naruto vs. Sasuke are all excellent examples of fight animation in long-running Shounen battle series. 
The animation takes a turn for the worse, however, when you start getting into the filler episodes. They start off fine until the big 85 episodes of filler begins and you see how cheaply the episodes are made and how ugly everything looks. Speaking of things that look ugly, sometimes the character models will look strange and distorted which can come off as very weird and half-assed. I think this might be a problem in the manga as well but some of the off looking characters can be vary jarring when you see them for the first time. This happens very rarely so it’s not too much of a problem. Apart from that, the background art looks amazing and is highly detailed. Even if a shot is barely animated the backgrounds are always interesting to look at and is proof of the crazy amount of work that Masashi Kishimoto put into when he first published each chapter. The show can look extremely beautiful at times but still looks kind of blurry at times (which is a problem shared with Bleach which means that it’s more down to what Studio Pierrot was doing). Naruto does a great gob in the Animation department). 
Final Thoughts:
Overall, if you are going to pick one of the Big 3 (Naruto, Bleach and One Piece) to watch, Naruto is your best bet. It’s fun, easy to get into and has a satisfying story where you see every character grow with every decision that they make in the show. It might be the only one worth watching in the end, since it hasn’t fallen apart like Bleach did and it might end unlike One Piece. Even though the show is 50% filler, you can still skip it which will make the experience shorter than what you may think. As it stands this first season of Naruto defined a whole new generation of anime fans when it premiered all the way back in 2002, and as it continues now in 2017, it continues to define a generation. A generation of Fighting Dreamers.

                This is my first review, and i want to start with one of the most known anime shows, ""Naruto"" that was aired in 2002 by TV Tokyo . This review is going to be short and to the point with no spoilers and i will talk about my opinion on fillers and the show.
Lets start !
For me ""Naruto"" is one of my favorite anime shows,i was watching the series when i was kid and maybe that's why the final score might be influenced than you may expect it to be.  I have read the manga too and i must say that the art is
                  amazing, the story is outstanding and you can easily figure out the personality of the characters.
The story overall is very good, intense with a lot of fighting, and very dramatic scenes.
Every character has some unique super power, which differentiates them from each other making the combat scenes more dynamic(in some of the cases) and more intense.
The evolution of the main characters are very well highlighted and i bet you will love some of them.
You will find a lot of comic scenes in the series.
The music/sound in the anime is good and it gives you the feeling of ninja combat and it greatly accentuates the dramatic scenes.
(I would like to recommend you to watch it with the audio in japanese, i don't know but it kinda gives you that feeling of ninja combat and for me its sounds much better, but its your choice and you must choose what fits you)
Lets now go to the fillers, and yes , i know many of you don't like them or not going to like them, they just, repeat, and repeat, and repeat, and repeat... (Maybe that's why the score of the anime is so small)
The fillers are trying to give you a much deeper understanding of the situation/characters from different perspectives. And i think its also reminding you things that happened in the past,  and i think this is good for someone that stopped watching the series for some time.
And yes,  i know that they are trying to get more out of it ($$$), bla bla bla.... but i think that you need respect the series and the work that the guys are doing.
So this are my scores :
Story : 8
Art : 9
Sound : 10
Character : 9
Enjoyment : 9
Overall : 9
I may not be a good critic or reviewer but this is my short opinion about this anime show.
I hope you will find this helpful !",9
"
                Naruto was the first anime that I've watched that drew me in of which I was aware of it being an anime. Due to that, I tend to consider Naruto the first anime I've watched, despite this not being true due to the fact that I've watched a bunch of other anime before it, but rather, because due to it I've gotten interested in the medium of anime as a whole. 
I've never really considered Naruto to be incredibly good, but I remember REALLY enjoying it and being into it. I really enjoyed the powers of the characters and the diversity and just the plain
                  multitude of possibility of powers that can be used, as well as for once that a cartoon is trying to present some tragic stories/backstories to their characters. It was, ironic to a lot of the traits Naruto has, is because of the fact it was a serious story. The first of its kind I've ever had experienced. But as Naruto went on and as I got older, Naruto (the franchise) became an obvious botch, where only about 50% of the content moved the story forward due to fillers.
But what is Naruto at its core?
Well, Naruto, at its highest points, is a story where the world presents some characters of whose motivations and capabilities are explained quite well, where you can have a character wanting to seek a high political position because they want to be accepted by all the people that have ostracized him through his entire life, or a character that is incapable of learning any sort of special power and decided to train himself physically to a ridiculous extent, just to prove that they can be as strong as everyone else, or a character that decided to become someone's tool for war, simply because said someone were the only parental figure willing to raise them. A lot of the characters have very strong motivations for what they are doing, and that makes them noteworthy and memorable, despite all their annoying/artificial personality traits, the things they've been through and their motivation for the direction they're moving towards is engaging and makes their personality mishaps pretty easy to ignore. 
Naruto at the core of what it tried to be is a meaningful story about people trying to get somewhere in life and how they've suffered. Which is a hard thing to execute, presenting a lot of characters, with different motivations, goals and stories. With all the shortcomings Naruto has, it is hard not to admit that its story was ambitious in the beginning, where a lot of the backstories the characters have been presented with would be enough to create an entire story arc or series just for that specific archetype. This ambition is what made it noteworthy in the beginning. Naruto tried to present a lot of stories at the same time, present a lot of ideas, without really focusing on a singular entity too much which worked both in its favor and in its detriment. What was in its favor was what I've already praised it for, the story at the highest point. 
And the detrimental part was the fact that it has no idea where to go and it tried to present too many characters and ideas. It kept creating powers, characters, motivations and other such things, but as the series progresses, especially in the sequel, the powers simply don't matter and the strategy behind the fights simply starts fading, because of the sheer multitude of powers, and the characters also start taking the back seat and being irrelevant, due to how many of them are currently. In this series however, the effect of this isn't really felt, but it is true that for the most part, the main characters don't and really, can't drive the story forward. This part of Naruto ends with both characters being just one step closer towards their goal, but still pretty far from it since its merely their first. That's very slow for 135 episodes of mostly non-filler.
Naruto suffers from the fact that it has no idea where to go and what to do after this series. It presents interesting powers, it creates interesting fights the more limitations it has, but the more tools it creates for itself, the less unique it becomes. Naruto wants to present interesting character stories, but it really starts forgetting on the way which characters caught the interest of the fans, and fails to deliver on them and thus manages to drag on, and just present a lot of new characters who don't really drag the story forward since their motivations are now singular or shallow. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't present this at all, but I want you to be aware of this, if you are a completitionist watcher, that Naruto's sequel will downgrade and why it downgrades.
So I won't drag on just like the Naruto franchise, the story of Naruto tries to present a lot of characters and their motivations and does a fairly good job at it, but in this process the main characters don't get a lot of progression towards the goal they've set up to be. The characters have interesting motivations, backstories and abilities, but their personality outside of all these things is often jarring. The main character is a rambunxious cunt who screams and rants about how much he wants to make his village great again every chance he gets and the other protagonist is an emo kid with a hate filled boner. The action in the series is mostly comprised of presenting a variety of powers and before there aren't a multitude of abilities presenting, also using them in an effective way in order to make up for your gap in your knowledge gap. The comedy in the series is pretty much ranch, with the main character transforming into a naked girl for people to laugh, I guess, or characters acting in really over the top manners such as crying or being overly violent because they were slightly critical of them.
In terms of production values, Naruto has a good soundtrack but some occasionally poor animation. The soundtrack is memorable because the composer used traditional japanese instruments while combining those with the sounds of more modern instruments, like guitars and drums. This made Naruto sound unique and innovative. And while Naruto's animation can be decent, it occasionally has some random dips in quality, where characters aren't drawn with a consistent level of detail to other points in the series or just because the series doesn't know how to color balance, partly because the series is also old.
To conclude, Naruto did plenty of things poorly and plenty of things that are worthy of praise. But ultimately would I recommend it? Yes and no. I think it is a good watch if you're intrigued to analyze the series and see what drew interest to it, and why it even started being successful. It has some interesting story arcs and characters because of their motivations and goals. If you're looking for something you want to watch past that, avoid Naruto because it just doesn't know where to go and it is pretty much the definition of a series dragging on. Naruto didn't know where to go and just aimed to present as much content as possible. Naruto was made to sell, not made to please. Which isn't something anybody can deny, with its high amount of fillers or its just general lack of progression for its main characters. But while Naruto was made to sell, it also sold because of some qualities that it indeed did have. It built interesting characters, it created some interesting powers. And it kept doing that, without ever realizing, that series sometimes, also need an overarching plot. Which Naruto while it may not lack, it does not focus on. And while I don't think that I will ever forget Naruto, because you never forget your first time, I don't see how a longwinded story which doesn't have a point and drags on, will keep dragging in new people.",5

                SPOILER FREEEE!!!!!!!!!!!
“Those that break the rules and regulations are scum. But those who abandon their comrades are worse than scum. If I'm going to be called scum either way, I'd rather break the rules! And if that's not being a proper shinobi, then I'll destroy that idea!”
Most people who have watched anime have seen Naruto at one point, the same goes for One Piece. For me, the face that i've been watching the show for so long kept me pulled in to keep watching when i started the series beginning to end for the first time. For other people who didn't grow up with the
                  show this same ""pull"" may not apply, especially for the first couple of episodes the show starts off rather slow just as most other anime or shows. Nevertheless i'd still recommend Naruto to anyone especially as a starter anime.
Story (7/10)
The story is quite unique in a way – it was set in an entirely different world which, at the same time, resembles real life situations such as wars, laws, conflicts, vengeance, hatred, loyalty, patriotism, and friendship. Although some may say it may resemble other anime, but the setting and the situation of this one is quite different, being in a world of ninjas and all. As mentioned earlier, they ingeniously designed each episode to make your mind wonder what will happen next whereas in psychology, they will feed you what you desire and before you become fully satisfied, they will take it away from you so that you will want to see what will happen in the next episode. Yet, there are too many fillers and for a while all they do is go on mission after mission. There doesn’t seem to be progress at times.
Art (8/10)
The art is about average, but depends on when you are watching it. If you were watching in 2014/2015 you would probably rate the art lower as to someone who watched it in 2004. The original run started in September 21, 1999, so to take it in consideration the art is fairly well down for it’s time compared to many other shows out there. 
Sound (8/10)
The soundtrack is really good. Soundtrack is good and very diverse, and there are certainly a few very awesome tracks, but I like the original better than Shippuuden because it suffers from poor timing and poor track placement, and the OST overall lacks the same sense of character that united all of the tracks. Great soundtracks would be Loneliness, The Rising Fighting Spirit and Sadness and Sorrow. Now overall, if you watch dubbed, in my opinion it’s horrible, but in Japanese it’s not bad. 
Character (9/10)
The character development is great. It takes a lot of time to get to know each character but in about 220 eps you pretty much get to know a little bit about everyone. They take 2-3 eps just to introduce a person or they add that person to the mission, so we get to know more about them. For example,  Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura are the characters you learn the most about in the original series, but say they add Neji to the team mission. During that mission which is usually about 2-3 eps you learn a lot about him. Another example would be during the exam, Rock Lee fights Gaara and it take 5+ eps but you learn so much about them. Now, I personally don’t like all the flashbacks but I do think they are valuable to learn about a character. 
Enjoy (7/10)
The enjoyment was average for me. Usually, I find myself skipping parts after a while because sometimes it would be boring. There would be a fight but that fight takes like 5 eps because of flashbacks, which is valuable sometimes,  but not when it’s a character who will only be there for those episodes. Take Sasuke’s arc for example when everyone is chasing him, the fights were awesome back there was a flashback every fight they got into. It personally takes the enjoyment away for me at times. . 
Overall (8/10)
Overall, Naruto has its ups and downs. The storyline is deep, with a plot that follows the manga. Naruto also has several filler arcs which lead away from the main plot. The music is great, and matches up with scenes well. The characters of Naruto, are well thought out.. they all have details about them and are interesting to watch. Animation is excellent. Fights are very detailed, you know how far away the characters are, and there are great camera angles.",8
"
                Like is the case for many people, Naruto was one of the first anime that I watched. And like a lot of people who hadn't seen much to compare it with, I loved it! But I grew up with Naruto and as time passed, I did find plenty wrong with it. Now it's a show that I like to make fun of out of love, like an old friend. So with that disclaimer out of the way, let's get to my actual thoughts on it.
Naruto is seen as one of the most overrated series of all time because to any seasoned anime viewer, it IS
                  average. The artwork can seem subpar, the shear number of filler episodes is terrifying, and certain dub voices can make you cringe. However, there are a few qualities that do make the series special. Not all of the music is great, but there are a few songs that you can't help but be moved by. And with the dozens of songs, you'll never get bored of hearing the same thing. Secondly, there's a great balance between plot, action, and fun time (granted, the humor isn't great, but hey, there's still action and drama, right?). And once you finish wading through the sea of filler, there are the moments that make it all worth it. But sometimes it does feel like work to get to those points, so if you're the type who would prefer an anime that doesn't hold back and jumps straight into an intense storyline, Naruto isn't for you. But if you enjoy a good long show that slowly develops lovable characters, is in no particular hurry to get where it's going (but it will get there), or just want to see an old classic, Naruto might be perfect for you.
Personally, I may have to watch it again soon myself. After all, this show really did change my childhood and probably made me a better person. I hope it can do the same for everyone else.",8
"
                I suppose why Naruto is so popular and can be welcomed for ages, the main reason is Naruto just like a funny booktext, every one reads it with fun and remembers the context and charaters. when we grow up the idea of be one of the character in Naruto just come out. and Naruto is still there.
              ",7
"
                    Over-hyped does not compare to describe this show.  I was looking forward to watching this show, but once I did, I regretted the decision.  I forced myself to watch 68 episodes, thinking I might find something I enjoyed, but I never did.  Most of the characters are horrible in this show.  There is Naruto, who wants to become the Hokage.  However, he does not seem to take it that serious and goofs off most of the time.  Plus, Naruto does not have to work hard because he has the power of the Nine-Tails.  After
                  a while, I think he forgets his long-term goal.  Then there is Sasuke, a one-dimensional emo character, but most of the girls swoon over him.  The worst character in Naruto has to be Sakura.  Besides the always whining and crying, she is also a horrible person.  I do not know how some people defend here characters, but she makes fun of Naruto for being an orphan.  If Mr. Emo would have not told her off about that, she would not have changed her attitude towards Naruto.  Then when the guys are working hard to get stronger, Sakura and Ino are playing with flowers and Sakura asks Ino why boys are like that?  Are these two girls not warriors as well?  Should they not try to become stronger?  Then the scenes of the cutting of the hair, it was too funny.  
    I would rather watch Dragon Ball Z, then this garbage.  I would recommend Hunter x Hunter (2011) and Katekyo Hitman Reborn!, instead of Naruto.",3
"
                I've both read the Naruto manga and watched the Anime. My personal summary is I absolutely love the entire series. I liked the following Naruto Shippuden a tad better, but all in all  Naruto is the perfect kickstart for this epic story. Naruto is popular for a very good reason, but as with anything popular this also leads to haters just for that reason. 
I believe Naruto shows us many elements of real life. Even re-reading and re-watching it in my 30's I believe it has life lessons that would make the world a better place and myself a better person. Having guts, valuing
                  friendship, banning hatred. I believe some of these are taught in the story in a very strong way. 
Story:
Especially when re-watching I enjoyed the introduction of characters, jutsu and other elements of the narotoverse. To me, everything makes sense and the build-up towards emotional developments, clashes between friends and incremental strength of characters is well thought out. All things introduced, later appear to have been mentioned for a reason. Not in a big announcement kind of way, but very distinctive.
Art:
Maybe not all of the artwork has the same amount of detail and attention. That being said, some of the scenes featuring hand-to-hand combat are magnificent. For me the artwork is good enough to have some elements in my child's bedroom. Can't be that bad then aye?
Sound:
No discussion. Intro and outro are continuously good. Changing every 20 episodes or so. But the real winner here is the beautifully matching and emotional music during various scenes. I know they've pushed me over the edge of having some tears every now and then. Simply beautiful.
Character:
Some characters annoy me. However, Naruto gives you many many options to choose your favourite character from. In addition almost all of them get enough screentime and a fair share of character development. Some, I simply like more than others (Naruto, Sasuke, Itachi, Shikamaru, Jiraya, Kakashi). Some (Sakura, Ino, Choji, Shino) are a bit shallow. Nevertheless the connection between most of the characters and the briliant development (and backstory) of some of them made me connect with the whole story. 
Enjoyment:
Both the manga and the anime I enjoyed very much. I personally could not get enough of Naruto, so I even enjoyed the filler episodes.",9
"
                Story:    10/10
Art: 8/10
There was really nothing unique about the art. the artwork was pretty much average throughout the entire series. However the artwork really shines when it gets to fighting scenes.
Sound: 8/10
The songs pulls you into the situation of the characters whether it be sadness, anger, or happiness. It makes the characters feel more real and can sympathize with.
Character:  10/10
Character development is what really special about Naruto. I have never felt so much for the characters in any other anime than in Naruto . I really appreciate getting insights with the characters' pasts then you really experience the emotions the character
                  might be feeling. I don't why people complain so much about the flashbacks. They don't bother me, it helps you feel for the charactes.
Enjoyment 10/10
What I really like about Naruto is it doesn't have just fighting and battles. ( Of course it does have that) It has comedy and little hints of romance. And especially emotion.
Overall  10/10",10

                Naruto-one of the world's most famous anime and manga series, that even people in countries like my own hear about even when it is not airing on the TV. 
It took some time before I decided to watch Naruto, because of ninjas(well the naruto world of ninja is really good si I got very surprised) and I thought it was just the same in every episode-they met a new enemy, defeated it and then it was done. And well there were also so many episodes, but don't let that stop you!
This is my first review, but I'll try my best!
STORY(10/10)
The story is really a masterpiece.
                  Many of the characters past and background are alike many humans in the real world. I really know some of the pain the characters were going through, even when I'm not a ninja or something.
It is easily to get hooked and there were times when I even cried. I really love the story because of its sad and happy times. 
But then the fillers came(which lasted for over 85 episodes). I know that the fillers made many people stop watching Naruto, and it is of course alright to skip them(you don't loose any of the story) but well, I watched it myself, ALL of them. They are really the worst I have ever seen. There were some interesting ones, there was one or two fillers that had a little bit of fantasy in it if I could say so.
Anyway, when I look at the real story it is so super good that it gets a 10!
But then there was the fillers(yes, over 85 episodes!)
ART(8/10)
The art was good too. Sometimes the background looks completly real! The charactars are detailed and I think most scenes are all right with it's art. There's just one problem, sometimes the characters are drawn really bad and it is easily to see when that happends. But I understand that, this is a really long series. But even so, the art can become much better.
SOUND(8/10)
The sound fits with the mood of nearly all scenes, especially the sad ones. I really wish they could use more emotional pieces, and they use the same music very often. 
CHARACTER(9/10)
Most of the characters are really interesting with their backgrounds and stories. But well it is often you get tired of Naruto, but it is really impressing me how he developes through the episodes(suddenly he is more marture). I nearly give this a 10, the only problem, the only problem is that there are a little bit too much characters. Like Ino(for example), she doesn't do anything important in the series(well it was the story of her friendship with Sakura). Anyway, I really like most of the characters.
ENJOYMENT(10/10)
I did really enjoy watching Naruto. It was unique, it was exciting, it was great. Now I really like ninjas. The funny bits are a bit childish often, but you will definetily laugh sometimes. I remember a time when I was watching Naruto I was eating noodles at the same time as Naruto was eating ramen in an episode.
OVERALL(10/10)
It is much in Naruto that could have been much better, but at the same time the story and characters are fantastic and you just can't stop watching it. That is why Naruto is my favorite. I highly recommend everyone to watch it!",10
"
                The story started off slow enough, it doesn't help that pace gets slower once you hit the chunin exams  and  relief doesn't arrive till well past the introduction Tsunade.
The decent fights are full of bloated dialogue
What ticked me off  was how overhyped people that Sasuke was.
What ticked me off even more was how filler increased when pace picked back up a bit around the Sasuke retrieval arc.
WHAT TICKED ME off the most was how there were so many frocking prodigies. Allow me to list: Sasuke, Kakashi, Neji, Shikamaru, Haku, Itachi, Kimimaro, Jiarya, Orochimaru, Tsunade, Gaara, All the Aukatski, Any kage, basically anyone
                  with kekkei ginkai. By the end even Naruto, the main character goes from idiot to prodigy in his own right.
Maybe in this alternated world, prodigies are the majority and your special if your actually not a genius
Don't finish this anime if you can't get hooked on by the 5th episode",1

                *NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW*
I like Naruto for various reasons. Mainly that I grew up watching it on VHS and I would always have so much fun pretending to be a shinobi.
The story is one of the best i've seen, and after watching it again last year I can confirm it even more.
The art may not look the best but the fight scenes are portrayed very well with the angles and sound and portray emotion very well.
The sound is very good and their are many unique effects famous from this anime.
OBVIOUSLY the characters are exceptional. You can really see their development and they get you
                  to feel emotion for lost characters.
Even the fillers in Naruto are very good and do a exceptional job at keeping you entertained. 
Overall, Naruto has Exceptional comedy with very good story arcs, characters, and fights. Naruto is so good that when you finish it you'll be sad that its over. Fantastic anime.",10
"
                I first watched Naruto as a teenager, around when it was released, and thought it was dumb and dull. Now nearly 20 years later, as a 34 year-old, I decided to revisit it...and am more confused by its popularity than ever. 
Shounen series had been around for a long time when Naruto was adapted into an anime in the early 2000s. Weekly Shonen Jump began publishing in 1968 and big hits like ""Ashita no Joe"" and ""Tiger Mask"" followed soon after. Monster 80's hits like ""Hokuto no Ken"" and ""Dragonball"" would define anime for the decade and spawned a slew of imitators.  
Now, shounen
                  is a formulaic genre (main character becomes stronger to defeat increasingly menacing foes), but that doesn't mean one can't do interesting things with it, or create very good, even great series. 
What strikes me the most about Naruto is how shabby and uninspired it is. In terms of plot, characters, and even the art, it resembles a forgettable early 90's shounen that poorly and lazily tries to copy more successful properties. 
To begin with, the art is basic and undetailed, and looks shockingly bad for an anime made after 2000. Faces lack distinguishing features aside from hair and eyes, and even the bodies are often interachangeable. It gets even worse with any action sequence, a central aspect to any shounen. The movement of the characters is all wrong, resembling that of an ungainly trash bag rather than actual human motion.   
One way the animators try to make up for this shortcoming is reducing the number of frames used, but that makes it even worse. Oftentimes, we see nothing between a character staring at an opponent and then suddenly hitting them. All the wind-up and movement in-between is ignored. 
For a series set in a secretive ninja world, it's surprisingly small and drab. There are very few characters that truly matter, and we meet most of them at the beginning. Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, and Hinata, who we encounter in a dingy classroom in the first episode, are the four main characters, and shape the ninja world as much as anyone. The Third Hokage, the most powerful ruler, is also met in Episode 1, and presented as no one special, just an old man administrator.  
Rather than a rich, expansive world with mysteries and an abundance of unique, competing groups and ninjas, Naruto feels meager and limited. It doesn't help that the villains are largely forgettable, too. 
Shounen heroes take a variety of forms. Some are more reserved and stoic, while others are passionate firebrands. However, all the successful ones have one trait in common. They're cool. Whether it's the silent badass or the manic underdog who refuses to give up, these are heroes young male viewers respect and want to be like. 
By contrast, Naruto Uzumaki is lame. He is loud and annoying. He doesn't take his ninja studies seriously, or ever demonstrate a consistent dedication to becoming stronger or better. And yet, through a deus ex machina, at a critical moment in a fight he says something menacing and threatening, which sounds laughable coming from this clown, and quickly wins.  
There's nothing cool here. His victories feel undeserved and he reminds me of the loser spastics back in school that no one liked, not anyone worthy or aspirational. 
Lastly, the writing is lazy, riddled with plot holes, and disrespects its own world. Take the very first episode, for instance. The Third Hokage is able to see Naruto through a crystal ball. Why then are the ninjas he deployed to find him unable to do so until Naruto triumphantly returns many hours later? Did the Hokage not communicate with his retainers? Do ninjas have no form of communication, and were none of the ninjas left behind at the village to protect it or receive further orders?  
The actual answer is much simpler. Interference would have spoiled the scene of Naruto defeating a treacherous adult ninja, and the writers hoped the viewers wouldn't think too hard.  
But there is a much worse scene in the first episode. At the beginning, using a Clone jutsu for a school exam, Naruto is only able to summon one copy of himself, and a useless one at that. Later, at the climax of his fight against the treacherous ninja, he summons countless dozens of clones, all capable of effective combat. 
What changed? This sensational improvement occurred in less than a day with just a little more practice on Naruto's part.  
In other words, we're meant to believe he was a miserable failure after presumably months or years of training, yet is a spectacular success after less than a day. 
Incoherence aside, if a jutsu can be mastered so thoroughly with less than a day's effort, then jutsus are simple and unimpressive. After all, would you respect anything, like Tic-Tac-Toe, that could be mastered in less than a day? 
Notice that even a flawed series like Dragonball treated martial arts with far more reverence. Fighters would make great strides only after training for weeks, months, or years. And this was usually not any normal training, but under the guidance of a legendary figure (Master Roshi, the Kais, etc.), frequently in a unique environment, like the Hypberbolic Time Chamber.
In this way, the series conveyed the difficulty and magnitude of attaining a higher power level or learning a technique.  
In Naruto, however, all it takes is less than a day's practice, so we must conclude that this is all child's play. (And given that these powerful ninjas beating up adults are in fact children, it is!) 
Of course, there are further plot holes here, as Naruto spawning 100+ copies of himself should easily defeat countless future enemies, but he conveniently doesn't always use it. Or waits to do so. 
Thus, we see that in every regard, Naruto is a very lousy, uninspired example of the shounen genre. The real mystery is how it ever became financially successful. I might not necessarily like other megapopular shounen, but in every other case, I can understand their popularity and acknowledge that it had either good or unique qualities. 
Naruto, meanwhile, flat-out sucks.",3

                A lot of friends recommended this anime to me so i had high expectations. But i didn't really  enjoy it. There were many things that bothered me, such as that there were many fillers. But the one thing that i hated the most was that the show was focused on sasuke..!! Sasuke is so cool..Sasuke is so strong..Sasuke is so mysterious..NO..!!! Sasuke is selfish, hateful and the only thing he cares about is revenge..! theres nothing cool about that..! The main character is NARUTO..! And yet the show makes him look like a total loser, stupid and weak..!! I didn't hate sasuke but i
                  wanted Naruto as the main character to have more attention focused on him..",7
"
                There's only one way to put this simply: Naruto rocks! 
The storyline? A young boy, Naruto Uzumaki, is possessed by a demon, the Nine-Tailed Fox. He's treated as a misfit, but in spite of this, he wants to be the Hokage. He goes to Ninja Academy, fights the Akatsuki menace, and tries to locate his teammate Sasuke.
If you get the chance to watch it you definitely should!

                Naruto is one of the most known shonen animes for reasons good and bad. the anime itself is a hit or miss and there is fair points for criticism within it, nostalgia and personal bias definitely factors into why its loved by many but i don’t blame those people because i love it too. flaws do exist within the series with the way the women characters were written, filler hate, and some questionable storylines but the love and hype it received was well deserved. 
i will admit, i am bias from the attachment and comfort this series brought me and continues to bring me since
                  it was the second anime i ever watched but i can acknowledge that isn’t the best written anime of all time. it’s writing at most is a 6 maybe a 7, but the story is easy to follow and enjoyable. it hits the humor and emotional marks when needed and the found family dynamics it holds is wonderful. Naruto himself is a character i find hard to hate, though often outshined by other characters in his own show he remains my favorite. his enthusiasm and drive is something inspiring and no matter how many times i rewatch it i always find myself rooting for him and wanting to succeed like i’m seeing it for the first time.
it’s definitely been overhyped over the years with an iffy fanbase and with the repeated recommendations to watch, it has definitely been tainted for some people but the only way to get a personal experience is to watch it with no little to no expectation in mind beforehand. coming in and expecting a perfect flawless anime will leave you disappointed in the end because Naruto definitely isn’t flawless, but coming in to give it a fair chance will hopefully make the experience more enjoyable. 
overall, Naruto isn’t perfect but it’s definitely a fun classic that deserves the love it gets so it remains a 10 in my book.",10
"
                Everyone makes Naruto out to be the most beginner anime out there; you can't watch anything until you've finished Naruto. While it is an older anime, and it isn't a bad anime, there are many things about Naruto that can be hard to follow, lame, or just cliche. Naruto comes along to be one of the greatest anime in existence - but I have to disagree. Like many of us here, we can agree that Naruto is a good anime... but it is a far cry from masterpiece.
I have not finished all of Naruto, but I have watched most of it. I have an idea
                  on how the rest of the anime will run. 
Story (6)
For those of you who read the summary, this anime is about a young male, Naruto Uzumaki, who wants to surpass the Hokage, or leader of the Leaf Village, through training and hard work as a Shinobi (ninja). It was one of things that had originally drew me into this anime. It seemed incredibly original, and it actually is. Many well-detailed plot twists, interesting plot at times, and moments of triumph reign this anime supreme. But that's only a small part of the anime outside of the filler episodes that go through it. 
The original story of Naruto does sound very nice... it's about Naruto who wants to be Hokage. But the anime dwells further and further away from Naruto's dream that it starts showing up less in the main episodes and starts making a new home inside of the filler episodes, where you can watch literal hours of Naruto trying to learn something, fail, and then do something ""spectacular"" or ""creative"" to master a technique. I kid you not, it's one of the most boring things to watch in an anime... ever.
As I mentioned before, the plot about Naruto begins to fade and shed new light on anime all-time favorite character Sasuke Uchiha, the last of the Uchiha clan, who survived a massacre not too long before the events of the anime, and when he wants revenge on a certain man. This is a great side-plot, but the thing that bugs me the most is that many episodes focus on Sasuke's dark desire to bring his family the justice they deserve. I believe several people already pointed it out in other reviews... You being watching many filler Naruto scenes, and many plot-ridden Sasuke scenes.
Like I said, for the most part, story's really nice. But the amount of filler and add-ons were enough to make four different Naruto mini-series called Sasuke, Naruto Training, Goofy Garbage, and Boring Garbage.
Art (8)
Graphics are at the best an 8. The character designs were key in my approval of the art style, but the animation flunked some times and characters could be unrecognizable in combat unless they were the focus of the camera. The art style, in my opinion, while old - looks very clean and nice, and I find it to be very creative and appealing to look at, even if it lacks detail in far-ranged shots. Again, character design was cool. Kakashi looks wonderful and like a true ninja and the members of the Akatsuki are pretty unique.
Sound (8)
Some music is good, other parts, not good. The opening songs in Naruto are very annoying and forgettable, as I found myself reaching for my remote to skip ahead of it and try not the die from ear blood loss. I don't know how others feel about the openings, but personally, I find all of them to be very horrible.
Sound effects used are comical and had me laughing a lot at times. Naruto's blissful stress and irritation can be seen entirely through the noise each character makes when they are in such states of distaste. Especially Sasuke. Snotty little boy. 
Character (9)
Characters are my favorite things in Naruto. While they can be repetitive and lack originality, which is why I give this section a 9 over a 10, most of the people in this are very interesting and make memorable moments through-out the anime, even Rock Lee, who had me scared at night thinking about that bowl cut and perfectly round eyes. Most characters have their flaws and evil sides, which is what makes for a truly interesting character, even Naruto, who has the spirit of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox inside of him, an aspect that makes the Hidden Leaf Village have large urges against him.
Enjoyment (7)
Story is good, lots of humor added in there, enjoyable characters, and generally interesting action sequences are what make this have a higher rating. However, even with the pros listed above, Naruto has many moments of filler episodes, fights that last for 10+ episodes, and events that happen in the fillers that had me pulling my teeth out. I get that it's not necessary to watch filler episodes, but it still exists. Very hard to enjoy watching repetitive things happen during the course of Naruto's training, especially when he is with Pervy Sage (Jiraiya). So I give this a 7.
Overall (7)
To round this off, Naruto isn't a bad anime. It's definitely one someone should hit if they haven't already, but don't expect your socks to be flying off during the events of what happen in this anime. This anime is good - but it isn't as great as everyone makes it out to be. If you have the time to be sitting through 200+ episodes, go ahead and watch this, and be sure to skip the filler episodes unless you want to be bald from tearing your hair out.",7
"
                While not to everyone's tastes, I personally thought this anime was amazing. Granted, it's one of those types of anime that you might think of as more of a cartoon than an anime. Very well designed characters that really evolve and change in dramatic, noticeable ways. The plot left me twisting in my seat and biting my nails in anticipation the entire time. You never know what will happen, only that it'll be something amazing and very exciting. Naruto changes everyone he meets and changes everyone's thoughts about practically everything. There isn't much romance, but there are a lot of dynamic characters. Everyone is different.
                  It isn't exactly supernatural, but it is more than natural. Everyone has their own kinds of different powers. 
Overall, an amazing anime. I simply loved it and have rewatched it no less than two or three times. Plan on watching it again in the future. Probably one of the longest good anime series ever. Can't wait to finish the continuing series, Naruto Shippuden.",9

                When i watch Naruto series did not watch it when it come out and i don't want to spoil you if you did not watch Naruto Part 1 so lets begin on the review.
Story: At frist i was not hype when it started i got hype when there begin to start Chunin exams. At all most at end of Naruto part 1 that Naruto vs Sasuke fight was amazing.
Art: Back then in 90s was good art work but now it dose not look great know.
Sound: The sound is alright but it not the best their have some great opening theme songs and ending theme songs.
Characters:
                  I enjoy the some of the characters in Naruto series and their 2 or 3  are annoying characters but their are alright that end of the series.
Enjoyment: well at start first i had feeling going to hate the series but then when i watch it i started to enjoy it.
Overall: I like the start and ending of part 1 of Naruto i enjoy story and i like developed of the characters in the Naruto series",9

                Naruto is an anime that I would call overrated because you hear more from people hating it then ones who like it. And I think a lot of that is because people want a shows full of mindless violence and flat characters that look cool like DBZ and Bleach. I find Naruto to be much better then either of those. Naruto and One Piece are my favorite Shonen series.
What sets Naruto apart, for me, is the world Kishimoto has formed and how every character has his or her own distinct fighting style and personality and dreams and goals. The plot has plenty of twists without
                  becoming complicated and you never have 10+ episodes of fighting one bad guy like in DBZ. Things move at a fast pace most of the time. There are times when it gets boring and the filler is annoying. I just skip it and I am surprised most people just don't look up which episodes are filler and skip them. Simple.
Unlike shows like Bleach, Naruto has remained popular in Japan (Bleach being canceled and replaced by a show starring a Naruto side character is proof of that) because it is not the same recycled plot over and over and over and you do really grow to care about the character.
Naruto does not deserve all of the hate it gets. I watch a lot of different anime and Naruto is what it is and should be enjoyed as a long running Shonen series with lots of fun for people with an open mind to it. I think people go into every anime expecting a masterpiece and pick them apart for no good reason. Just let go and have fun. You just might enjoy it.",9
"
                Naruto is one of my favorite mangas and tv shows in the world i think the art is pretty good but what caught my attention was the story. the character choices in this show were very good [ a hero, a guy that wants revenge, a girl who doens't know that she is liked but instead likes a guy that cant stand her, and a just plain weird old man who has some funny secrets.] 
enjoyment was awesome i fust wish they'd make the episodes longer than 30 minutes. i was always wanting more in the end. 
but overall one of the best manga and
                  tv shows i have ever seen.",9
"
                I only recently got into anime, and so had the benefit of doing some research before watching the first series of Naruto.  I was able to skip all of the filler episodes, and believe me, nearly 50% of the anime is filler.  So, even though I said above that I've seen all 220 episodes, I've really only watched the canon episodes and a few of the recommended fillers.
Even so, Naruto was one of those shows that needed to grow on me.  Having previously watched Hunter x Hunter, it took me until after the Ninja Test arc to really get into it because
                  so much of it reminded me of Hunter x Hunter.  Nevertheless, once the two ""test"" arcs parted ways I felt Naruto better eased into its own thing.
I have the character mark an 8 because when I began the show I only saw Naruto as a whiny brat, but by the end his character really grew on me. Pacing might be a bit slow for some, but I'm one of those people who enjoy back stories and getting to know characters better.  For this reason I still have a few filler ""arcs"" that I've heard were good and might want to go back and watch.
In the end, I thought the series was highly enjoyable to watch.  I originally was hesitant to only watch the canon episodes, but having done so I'm glad I did.  There are a number of websites that list these.  Since the show is up in part on Netflix and other streaming avenues, I would also recommend finding the wiki on how the episodes divide into arcs.  This helped me get a sense of direction when watching.",8
"
                I'm going to keep this short as I can. This is a great show and has the potential to be one of the best anime series possibly of all time, but an incredibly irritating main character who you also love, a very stereo typical rivalry, an incredibly stereotypical love triangle, a ratio of 1 to 500, 1 being action, 1000 being dialogue and memory flashbacks, some sloppy art (forgivable with the amount of episodes but considering how sometimes it looks like a child drew it, it's inexcusable to me).
Also it has that goku vs freezer on namek issue where what should have LITERALLY been a
                  5 minute battle is stretched over about 10 or 15 20 minute episodes.
Take away all this and you have an amazing anime, but unfortunately, I do not recommend you watch this unless you have an incredible amount of patience and a high tolerance or like even, for annoying characters who do a running commentary on what they are doing, what they are going to do, and all that stuff every 5 minutes. It's great if you have a bad memory because you will always be reminded of what's going every 5 minutes of every episodes.
I wouldn't say it deserves the hype that it had and still has now but the story is good, especially if you manage to bare with it until it gets to shippuden where it gets much less annoying and the story gets REALLY interesting.",7
"
                I want to make my review simple and concise so here:
I only watched 25 episodes of Naruto, a lot of people would say that makes me unfit to review, I completely disagree, I believe an anime should have you hooked within the first 10 episodes and I gave Naruto over double that.
I spent several hours with this show and whether there is light at the end of the tunnel or not I cannot recommend this show to anyone because of what you have to go through to get there. 
PROS:
- Pretty charming at points
- Great soundtrack
- Interesting World - Some interesting powers
CONS:
- Weak writing
- Bad pacing
- Childish humor
- Uninteresting fights 
- Annoying Characters",5

                Naruto has some of the most interesting supporting characters you'll see in an anime, and there are a lot of them.  The main character and story line on the other hand are nothing special; both being frequently annoying and incredibly redundant.  I'm not same the the anime is bad.  I could be quite enjoyable if you like that sort of thing.  But its nothing new and there are really no elements to set it apart.  It is average at best and doesn't deserve the hype it gets.

                ok, let's be honest, most people who are into anime have heard in some way shape or form about naruto that it's either the greatest anime ever or its garbage. well it's neither of those things so let's talk about it. naruto is about a young ninja's journey to become the leader of his village someday and we get to see that growth through part one and then into shippuden (of which i will write my review on it later)
pro's of naruto
1. excellent characters
- the thing about naruto compared to alot of other anime's out there who have well written characters and sometimes even very
                  well written and also relatable. naruto has both. most of the characters in naruto have extremely unique personality's that  will appeal to a wide arrange of people and some might even be able to relate to more then one character. and more often then not if your end up liking this anime you'll probably be thinking at some point ""why don't i get to this such and such character more"" it happens alot and sadly there are a couple characters i wish we would have gotten to see less of (sakura) and more of (neji,hinata, asuma). to go along with their unique personalitys they are come with their own unique skill sets making most of the characters to be special and strong in certain area's (except sakura, no i am not trying to trash this character i actually like sakura but she doesn't do much in part one despite the fact she's the main heroine).
2.solid fighting
- the fighting scenes in the show do start off fairly slow but they do get much better with each episode to show how the characters fighting and skills improve.
3. excellent storytelling
- there is a solid main story here that is always pretty on target to reaching a certain point and it does keep you invested throughout the show. even though there is alot of filler (AHAHAHAHA) even some of that is interesting and somewhat needed
4. soundtrack
-the feels
cons
1.filler
-iam going to go ahead and say that i don't hate filler but naruto does WAY OVER DUE IT. some filler is needed in order to explain many of the backstorys with certain characters which is fine but more often then you'll feel as if its a complete waste of time
2.flashbacks
-way to many in part one, we get it this certain thing happend we don't need to see it 5 fucking times
3.artwork
-in some episodes its great others not so much
4.wasted potential of a main character
-SAKURA HARUNO
5.some parts could be explained more in part one but are just kinda swept aside.
overall this is a good anime, one of my favorites because i grew up with it, i reccomend everyone at least TRY it and if you don't like it you don't like it.",9

                Alright first review I've ever done, so I'm going to tackle a show near and dear to my heart.
Naruto
For many anime fans this was the gateway anime that entered them into this culture. It was flashy, fun, and definitely appealed to a great many with it's over the top action.
Looking back however, it doesn't have the gleam as it once did.
Story: 6
The story has a simple premise in common with many shonen, group of kids with special powers go and defeat the bad guys and save the world or town. Then more bad guys are introduced and true motives are revealed and it starts to
                  become a jumbled mess. In first 6 seasons of the show( minus any filler), the story was clean, simple, and engaging to an extent; come the start of the filler seasons, the story begins to needlessly complicate then come shippuden everything falls apart into a jumbled mess full of plot holes.
Art: 6
The art in Naruto is vibrant (though a little flat at points) and makes good use of color palette and the various villages have pretty interesting designs. The animation though is solid at best and downright pitiful at worst .Shippuden improves on this factor. (Sometimes)
Sound:9
Now this in my opinion is what made Naruto stand out among the other ""Big Three"" The opening and closing themes are almost always catchy and the background music has a distinctly Japanese feel that always complements the mood. 
Character: 6
Now here is definitely the most controversial aspect of Naruto.
Lets start with the main Three
Naruto: He's your typical loudmouth, hyperactive shonen protagonist. Though he does go from being bratty to a more typical hero, there's virtually nothing about him that stands out from other characters, except maybe his fashion sense.
Sasuke: He's the token cool mysterious black-haired character who is rivals with the protagonist. He's not really interesting and his turn to darkness is seen from a mile away. He just gets worse throughout the series. There's really not much to say about his character, he exists to serve as character development and plot. ( And fangirl-bait)
Sakura: She's the absolute worst of the bunch. This character mearly serves the role of being the ""girl"" on the team and having a crush on the cool kid. Even though she did well on the ninja exams, she shows absolutely zero capability in combat and sits on the sidelines waiting for one of the male leads to rescue her.  She has no real character traits other than ""Tsundere"" until season 5 where she becomes aware of her own uselessness. I blame the author for her lack of character, most of his female characters are atrociously written. That being said, she does develop a personality and becomes extremely useful in Shippuden and actually becomes likable.
For the other characters it's hit or miss, some bring something new to the character archtypes, though most are flat though with little depth. That being said, there is substantial character development with almost all of the characters during Shippuden and 5+ on. Plus, since this anime is so huge by the time you finish it the characters become like family to you.
Enjoyment:5
Naruto's battles are extremely fun to watch the the author gets extremely creative with his ninja abilities and powers. However, with the amount  of flashbacks and fillers, you won't be seeing too many exciting moments. The dialog progressively gets better with each season, so you have that to look forward to. 
(Gets a solid 10 for nostalgia rewatch value.)
Overall: 6
Naruto is not a terrible anime, but it's certainly not a great one either. Its cliche and stereotyped, but it's enjoyable, goofily bad, and manages to bring fond memories back. If you are the type of person who likes creative powers and rare but memorable fight scenes( and has a ton of time on their hands) this anime is for you.
If you are someone looking for emotionally deep characters and stunning plot,  might not be the best choice.",6
"
                Dattebayo! That's the trademark of one of the most famous anime character, Naruto. Named by some kind of ingredient in ramen. The story is just wow. It's just plain epic! You can see the journey of a boy who is being resent growing up to be a great ninja and become Hokage. All of the conflict, the struggles, tough challenges and emotional elements blended very well. But, it was kind of disappointing when your hero was unable to safe his friend. Anyway, the art of this series was very good. The character was written very well. You can see almost every relevant character got their
                  times to shine and everyone was developed greatly. Moreover, I can relate with most of this characters, which means it was carefully planned. I was enlightened by this story greatly. It gives you so many live lessons. It's not just some cartoon for kids, it's more than that. I called it cartoon before. Overall, I know this story does not perfect. It has it's flaws and not all people can get into it. It contains quite number of fillers too. I recommend you who read this to watch this series if you haven't.",9
"
                Naruto is SOOOOOO popular. All anime fans know of Naruto. Even non anime fans know about Naruto. 
I'm always surprised when I see that someone has never heard of Naruto before. 
Anyway..................Story: 10/10 
The good thing about Naruto is the UNIVERSE. There are many villages, the villages have ninjas who can use jutsu. Jounin, Chuunin, Genin, Hokage, ANBU....
And the awesome story where
Character:10/10
 the main character is a lonely orphan with a demon fox sealed inside him, so the entire village hates him. That's an impressive fact. Naruto. 
And the other main character is a boy who's older brother killed his entire family/clan. Wow. Sasuke.
The third main character is a normal girl with nothing special about her and a hell annoying personality. OK. Sakura. Boring 0/10 
So Sakura gets a lot of hate. But the good thing about this character is that she gives us a lot to expand upon, if we use our imagination or write fanfiction like Sakura's Glasses where you can give her the Sharingan or whatever powers you want or place her wherever you want in the plot or make her get trained by Obito or something. 10/10 
Basically this is the best anime because it lets readers get creative with the characters and make fanart, fanfiction, doujinshi, yaoi, etc. 
So even if the story is lame, the universe is good and makes up for the rest. 
And it's still an interesting story. JUST, make sure you skip all the fillers because it has nothing to do with the story, it's a waste of time unless you don't mind comedy episodes (for me it's hard to humor me and I hate all things comedy so I hate fillers,) 
Then it will be good. 
I enjoyed it 10/10",10

                Oh, Naruto. I want to give this series a higher rating since it is the first anime series I have ever watched and is actually the one that helped me decide I should continue watching more. However, with the sheer amount of high quality content out there, Naruto comes off overrated, even with its few redeemable qualities.
Story – 5
Without discussion of how events unfold in Shippuden, Naruto shows the early stages before the time skip of when 3 ninja have to individually develop their skills and learn the values of teamwork. I must say the story starts off excellent – there’s discussion of the ninja
                  rules, hopeless battles that are turned around by the protagonists through tact, and introductions of characters that build them up to be extremely threatening. The coolest part of the Naruto story is how ninjas are constantly tested by their ability to see through deception. That being said, the Naruto series is almost half filler (I’m not exaggerating) and beats to death the value of friendship, but in a more “telling” way than “showing” way. At the climax of the story, viewers are supposed to feel the tension of a friendship falling apart between Naruto and Sasuke. However, while the two did have fun times, they rarely shared personal moments or really exhibited their friendship towards each other. They only enjoyed each other in a misery-loves-company way because of how they both grew up alone. For me, the strong bond I was supposed to see simply wasn’t there. 
Art – 3
The art improves in Shippuden, but the quality of the animation and the jagged uncomfortable drawings of the characters is really off-putting. This is a combination of Kishimoto’s originally slipshod art skills (it gets better) at the beginning of the series and just poor animation. None of the characters look good proportionally, especially the women. The scenery and Konoha itself are really nothing special either, and most of the background is painfully simple in design. Background characters look like almost no effort was put into drawing them. Still, I suppose I have seen worse.
Sound – 6
The music is fitting to the anime, but nothing besides the battle soundtracks are really anything special. Compare the soundtrack of Naruto to masterpiece shows like Attack on Titan, Cowboy Bepop, or Puella Magi. The opening themes are nothing special but do have some very enjoyable tunes with JRock standouts like ROCKS, Yura Yura, Haruka Kanata, and Fighting Dreamers. While fitting, the soundtrack rarely evokes the intense emotion required of the scene. This also improves in Shippuden.
Character – 3
Boy, oh boy, character development is such a disaster on this show I don’t even know where to begin. The show throws a large ensemble cast at you during the Chunin exams, almost ALL of who add nothing to the story and become complete background throughout the series. The series is also the best at building up characters to seem like they are either strong or have significant plot impact only to forget about them entirely. Examples are Sakura, one of the main characters, who doesn’t exhibit a single unique skill throughout the series (and while she gets better in Shippuden skill-wise, she is given almost no screentime) and is in the story because it needs a damsel in distress. The rest of the kunoichi in the series are no better – We don’t even know Tenten’s personality, Hinata’s around for her crush on Naruto and is just a weaker version of Neji, and Ino is the same character as Sakura except with one skill that is extremely difficult to use when fighting on her own. The fifth hokage, Tsunade, is brought in as the strongest ninja in the village, but her skills are rarely showcased either – except that one time she beats up a guy who already had NO ARMS. The same goes for her teammate Jiraiya, another legendary ninja who barely gets a chance to show his stuff, his one time in battle being so drugged by Tsunade he was essentially useless.
Little else is shown about the other characters’ pasts, male or female. We know that Naruto and Sasuke had it rough as orphans and the Hyugas have a complicated family structure, but we are to assume that most of the other characters live normal lives otherwise. There’s no complexity in their pasts, and very little happens to them throughout the show to shape them into better people, unless it’s a villain who miraculously got turned around by Naruto’s words about how friendship is important (if only it was that easy in real life, eh?). The one true gem of Naruto’s cast is Shikamaru, whose sheer intelligence and developed leadership after the chunin exam makes him impressive and exciting to watch. Overall, however, what One Piece accomplishes for over a hundred characters, including a boat, Naruto fails to for a dozen. 
Overall – 6
While Naruto is heavily flawed in most ways, looking at it as a whole is quite different. In the same way books like Twilight are page turners, Naruto keeps you on your toes and each arc is genuinely interesting even if the quality of its storytelling is bland. There is plenty of action, maybe so much action that it detracts from all other aspects of the story. Nevertheless, it’s a show about ninjas geared towards teenage boys, and in that respect, it does well. The series presents itself as an amazing gateway anime, and it certainly is still worth watching.",6

                Naruto is one of the most well known anime of all time. Many people love it, many people hate it. I love it. Yes, it may be overrated, but I give it a 10 cuz its one of my favorite animes. Ever since I started watching it, I got hooked. I am still crazy about it. It may have fillers, has flaws, and the characters can get annoying, its still a lovable series. I wil try not to include spoilers. 
Naruto is about a boy named Naruto Uzamaki who had no friends. He was always alone, and sad. He never understood why everyone hated him.
                  The truth is, the Nine Tailed Fox is inside of him. 12 years ago, this creature attacked the hidden leaf village. The 4th hokage sealed the monster inside Naruto. Thats why everyone hates him. Naruto's main goal is to become hokage and make everyone see how great he is. He starts training as a genin Ninja, and joins Team 7, with the leader being Kakashi Hateo, a Jonin Ninja. Naruto's two teammates are Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haurno. Sasuke is a grumpy, nasty boy from the Uchiha Clan, and is out of revenge. Sakura Haurno is from the Haurno Clan I guess? She has a huge crush on Sasuke and hates Naruto. Naruto and his team go on mission's, train, and go in the Chunnin Exam. Naruto's quest now begans as he encounters death, lost, and betrayl.
While the series may have fillers, they arent to bad. Episodes 136-220 is all filler, so episode 135 is the last canon episode. Most of the fillers do get in the way, but some are funny and enjoyable. 
This anime does have a good soundtrack. It has one of the greatest soundtracks in all of anime. The music is amazing! The opening songs are very catchy and lovable. 
When it comes to fight scenes, Naruto doesnt fail with that. Most of Naruto is fight scenes. The fight between Naruto and Neji was amazing. It was exiting, and I didnt expect what happened.(Im not going to spoil that). The fight with Naruto and Sasuke was epic, and it was like 6 episodes. It was very intense. This anime really gets you hyped when it comes to pure action. 
This doesnt mean this anime isnt funny. You will get plenty of laughs from all the characters. Naruto may be funny with his foolishness, and his Sexy no Jutsu, but there are fillers that will make you laugh really hard. Like the filler with Naruto wanting to know what Kakashi looks like without the mask, it was so funny how they tried to do it. Its also funny when Sakura gets pissed and beats the shit out of everyone. The funnist moments are when Jiayria is being a pervert. 
I also love the characters. I always Gaara. He is pure badass. He has a amazing character development, design, and personality. I love his Sand Jutsu, which makes him so strong. I also really like Itachi. Besides from Gaara, Itachi is the most badass character you can find in the original series. But almost all the characters are enjoyable and memorable. A few like Ma Sakura, Shino, and Komamahru are just annoying. But the character development is still good, mostly for Naruto.
One thing I dont like is how half of the series is based of Sasuke. Naruto is the star. He should be the really important one. But is Saskue that everyone worries about. Like everyone is after him, he dissapers, he leaves the leaf village. Most of the anime is all Sasuke. But I still love the anime either way.
This anime isnt to sad. But there are some moments that are so sad. Like when Ikura went to save Naruto from danger. I almost cried when I saw it for the first time. When the 3rd Hokage died it was also very upsetting. I cried every time. This anime also has sad music that gets me upset. This anime can get you in the feels.
I really think this anime is really good. I always enjoyed it. I have rewatched this anime a few times, and it still never gets old. I do understand why people might not like it, and thats okay. Yes, its overrated, but I still give it a 10 cuz I love it. Plz dont write that im stupid on my comments just cuz I gave it a 10 and called it overrated. It is. But im one of those lovers. If your new to anime, this is a good choice. If your a older anime fan, then I cant recommend it. Its one of my favorite animes, and I will always love it.",10
"
                 Masashi Kishimoto's Naruto in my opinon was and is an outstanding anime. The story line was well written, the charcters well developed, The soundtrack was good and the art deserves a thumbs up. 
The moral of the story is different for each person who reads and watchs naruto, but to see such wonderful characters change and grow with each episode and chapter that is produced could make anyone pleased if they had the eyes, ears and heart to see it. I would recommend this anime/manga to anyone who likes a lilttle action and a good story line. :)
I enjoyed it very much :)

                Hello back with a review for naruto p1 
The story: 
at the first 2 arcs it was really decent but once the konoha attack started it became serious and amaaing specially akatsuki which are really interesting. it got some silly moments and fillers are really bad but its not a problem just skip them. the first arc story was just good for a prologue its gave us an amazing backstory between zabusa and the other guy. the chunin exam was really boring and a part of any exam arc in anime until orochimaru appeared it got us interested. who's that guy? whats his goal? many
                  other things konoha attack arc was awesome got the best fights specially the hokage level fight the building of orochimaru and gaara is perfect for a psycho path character. search for tsunade welcomed a really interesting organization got us wondering who exactly are they. the last arc was really decent bad pacing but its idea is cool and the development of sauske. I rate the story 9/10 
The art: 
really decent don't ever think of pausing you will see the worst frames ever but in normal watching its just good so 9/10 no one would feel that without pausing
sound: 
10/10 easily sad themes are great and it suits the events 
character: 
naruto always develops and not the same unlike some mc's like luffy. he's not the most stupid he's just normally stupid. Every side character got a backstory and a motivation and a goal which is perfect no would like more than that some great characters like orochimaru and itachi made the anime more enjoyable. sauske and naruto development is perfect too and sauske is following the same path as his brother to get power. 10/10 for me
enjoyment: 
Omg the pacing of chunin exams decreased the enjoyment with a crazy way but everything else was enjoyable the psycho path characters gave a special mood so 9/10
overall: 9/10",9

                Well, my first review on this website - lets see how this goes!
So, I like to think of myself as a definite otaku (...sad to admit, I know). However if being obsessed over anime is what 'otaku' means then I most definitely fit the description.
Naruto was the second anime I watched when I was beginning my 'japanese cartoon' journey and I'll tell you all now - if you want to get yourself dedicated to a shounen/ninja/hero/action anime with a little emotional rollarcoaster thrown in with a bucket of laughs to top it off then Naruto is definitely one to get yourself attached to. True, you
                  might think I'm going into this with a bias opinion and I probably am however I'm going to write a review anyway.
Story:-
          I gave the story a 9 because despite my never ending love for the anime it does contain a few plot holes which (depending on how hard you look) are noticable when you look back. For example; parents! We don't see enough of the parents buuuut nagging parents aren't something you want in an action packed anime. It might just be the hardcore fans that need the little details (I know I certainly do). And when I say little details, that's all they really are. The story arcs all eventually link together towards the end of Shippuden (which is the sequal season to Naruto) but you can tell that at the beginning of Naruto they didn't know they were going to have a second season.
Art:-
       I gave the art an 8. Now I was a bit skeptical of my choice because the only reason I'm not marking it a nine is because of it's age. It was first released in 2002 so you can only imagine the old animating style they used to have then. You can clearly see the progression of the style as time goes on. In the main areas of animation; speaking, running, fighting etc I'd say they're top notch for the resources they had 'back in the day'. 
Sound:-
            I gave this a 10 because of the soundtrack. Naruto (and Shippuden) has some of the most beautiful and emotional music in the anime community. When I'm looking at Youtube comments I can see that people who don't want the anime are listening to this music. It's amazing. Simply put. And when put to the animation it's even more incredible. Such an experience! Real edge of your seat stuff! (I don't mean to sound cheesy).
Character:-
                 This is where Naruto gets a liiiittle flawed. I'm giving it an 8 because of the way they sometimes portray little girls. And I don't mean anything to do with hentai, Christ no, I just mean sometimes they forget how young girls are. You know it; crying. And this is where I'll leave it for 'character' because I don't want you to go into this anime clouded by the fact they portray some girls a little annoying. 
Enjoyment:-
                  Well, obviously a 10! I, to this day, enjoy Naruto as much as I did when I first started it. Thoroughly enjoy every episode, including the fillers. 
Overall:-
             I gave it a 9 all together because of the two 8s and two 10s. Overall a fantastic anime which came to it's end at 220 episodes. When you get to the end, God, you don't know how to feel. You don't know if you can ever feel again. But it's worth, afterwards you get a whole season more!
WhooO!
I think I lost steam towards the end but I hope you find the time in your schedule to add this in. It's a great anime!",9

                Story(10) A young jinchuuriki that have a fox goes through hardships to achieve the goal of becoming Hokage. Friends join him on his adventure, and the extravagance ideals of what makes a shinobi differs from each individual. (Personal Opinion) This anime is a extravaganza of fun, and if you like characters that aim to be cool,silly, or other fun personalities this is the one to watch. I'd would personally skip some fillers ,and some are enjoyable this part differentiates with a individual I didn't take away a point since you can skip it.
Art(10) For it's time it did outstanding the fluidness of the battles is
                  where it shows. 
Sound(10) Never have I'd imagine a masterpiece to my ears during the personal moments of a shinobi, and the fun moments of one. It's really good to listen to.
Character(10) There's got to be a favorite character for each watcher of this series, and the one you find annoying which isn't a bad thing. The uniqueness of each individual is prevalent by far.
Enjoyment(10) You have a well rounded story minus the fillers, and great character build up. Also a nice touch to the soundtrack.
Overall(10)",10

                what can i say this is the best anime out there. Infact naruto was my first anime. When it came on toonami all i thought was heh this isnt cool but that was ny trend, if its not cool in school its not cool at all. after that i just couldnt stop watching it. the action the story all to good. a bit disapointed for what happened in the middle of the show ( hehe dont worry i wont spoil it ). the fighting is what hoocked me on it was just so flagrant with kicks and flips, just outstanding. all i can say in
                  the end is naruto is the best only top in my book anyday!",10

                Naruto. An anime that probably everyone has heard of.
I first began watching this as a child and grew accustomed to the bright and crazy tale of Naruto Uzumaki, but it was soon lost in my past.
After picking it up again, I was stunned as to how much I could now appreciate it after reading the manga and becoming a reasonably seasoned anime viewer.
I soon became re-absorbed into the world of the shinobi, with Naruto Uzumaki the number one knuckle head ninja of the leaf.
The story in inclusive and beautifully told, the art is stunning and cheerful but knows when to bring in deeper colours for
                  the more saddening areas.
The character development is what I found most interesting though. As expected for a 220 episode anime, there is a lot of character development, but what made me even more interested was the fact that characters that are side-characters or  have a smaller role in the tale, their background and stories are told with just as much depth as the main characters.
Overall, I found Naruto not just a fun and exciting anime, but a beautiful work of art that even had me close to tears.
I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of ninjas, japan, serious storyline, with a lot of fun on the side.",10
"
                Saw this anime  when I was a kid but never really finished it nor watched it religiously, then when I moved country I needed a show that somewhat feels like home al and saw this on Netflix, finished the whole thing so fast, that time Shippuden's dubbed wasn't finish yet so I watched it on subbed, just my own preference I like dubbed more coz I hate reading subtitles.. I wanna see the characters facial reactions into detail.. just me. LOVE the character development. 
Rewatched it early this year again, from Naruto to shippuden, and the movie, the nostagia is the same.
the whole NARUTO
                  is overall my favourite anime, and will let my kids watch this someday.",10

                Ah Naruto the classic anime underrated by these dbz loving so-called ""experts"" with a very original but simple concept if you think about it i mean sure some parts can be callled cliche for example the hidden power thing but be that cast aside its a epic storyline about his journey to bring back his best friend
Story: It starts with him beeing an outcast in his own village, joining a group of genin shinobi with the two genins Sakura and Sasuke he begins practically hating Sasuke but they begin earning each others mutual respect and befriending each other as rivals when the antagonist starts appealing
                  to Sasukes dark past and his thirst for revenge it ends up in him leaving the village having Naruto and Sakura desperatly searching for clues on his whereabouts. i give the story10/10
Art and Animation: well its a well drawn anime and compared to the shitty dragonball art it can be counted as epic but ive seen better and animation was pretty good or at least in the fights 
and as for the the characters well they were great sure some cliches like iill die protecting my friends and that but that still matches well with the story and though Naruto's character shaping would probably be pretty stereotype in the anime world and sure sakura is the typical schoolgirl personality all of that matches in with the story, and not to mention the awesome support charcters
But the main thing about Naruto is that youll enjoy it very much and if you watch naruto youll never ever consider watching such shitty  art as dragonball",10
"
                Honestly, this anime is amazing, this is the only review you need about it. YES it gets a lot of hate, some saying that it is ""over hyped"" but i disagree. For it's time it is amazing, i grew up with it and saw the characters develop along with me. A lot of who i am is because of this anime. I love the plot twists in this anime and the way the story flows it never feels forced, even the fillers keep you interested.
If you are looking for an anime to immerse yourself into this is it. The music composing is simply insane.

                There are so many good thins to say about Naruto and also a few bad things, but the biggest issue most people complain about, are the many filler episodes. To enjoy this great anime I recommend to skip these episodes, there are many sites that have a list of these episodes so it's easy to skip the fillers and to start enjoyimng the actual show. 
The story of Naruto is great, I love everything about the world the anime takes you in. The way they make you love the village and the ninjas in it, it's just amazing. The storyline has so many exciting things
                  and unexpected twists. It didn't take me long to adjust to this show and love it.
The art is good, but I've seen better. The characters look very unique but when it comes to quality it isn't outstanding. But I have to say that I have no problems with this. The fight scenes look good and almost each fight is memorable.
The music in Naruto fits in every aspect. This is such an important feature in Naruto. It completes every scene in it. Almost every opening is an opening that you won't skip. The music is just great.
The character diversity is another great thing about Naruto. You'll love so much characters as much as you love Naruto himself. Each and everyone has something unique and that's why you'll love them. A lot of character developement, very divers abilities, diffrent disigns. Konoha isn't the same if one of its ninjas wasn't there.
This show is a must see, but I highly recommend that you skip the fillers, its much more fun that way. I don't think that anyone who has watched everything without fillers has regrets. A lot of people love it and there's a reason why!",10

                One of my fav ANIME. People say it's a long series but for the people who have kept up with it, u know how kool this show is. The story is funny, even without romance it displays a mature side of ninja (usually ppl joke about bein ninja and laugh at it) this anime shows the part of the pain of reality. The evolution of characters is like watching someone grow up. Touching, at some episodes it'll make you squeal, cry, laugh, yell, and many more. Honestly its like life in some aspects but the thing is its very different. The characters you'll fall in
                  love with, many different qualities and personalities. Random moments (if u ever watch it, look up episode 101^^) opening songs, personally ive liked them, not all tho. At times you can relate to the characters perfectly and that's exactly why you'll like this anime. But warning, do NOT try to do the thingz they do on the show. It's animation, keep in mind anything is basically possible so dont go trying to climb a tree or punch it a thousand times.",10

                Naruto. Its a good anime. Good story. Good characters. But it has WAY too many fillers! Its basic story is amazing. But the fillers killed it.I love the rivalry between Naruto and Saskue,thats great,same with Ino ans Sakara. It had me all the way til after the chunin exams. Then it was kinda....okay?? But then it got better. But it should have ended after Naruto v.s. Saskue. I give it an 8. Its Great! But not perfect.
              ",8
"
                First things first: because of the obvious deviation and independence from the main story of the Naruto filler material, I am not regarding it as part of the series. I prefer to think of it as misplaced OVA material.
Fillers aside, I find this an awesome series, very well constructed, mixing great battle intensity with intricate major and side plots, and placing focus on character development. Only in its last arc does it drag for too long, and for a while it becomes almost arcade like - battle after battle after battle. Story stays on hold for a while, and for that reason it earns no
                  perfect score - indeed, I almost rated it with an 8, but because the previous arcs were so great, a 9 should be fair.",9
"
                After watching the entire of Naruto (fillers and all), I give the show a score of 8. It's not the best anime by any means' but it definitely has an endearing quality to it. If you're thinking about watching, go in knowing that there will be tedious fillers and that the show is not perfect, just enjoy the little details like character quirks and jokes which make Naruto great on a whole.
In the first episode I did not like the main character, Naruto, at all but once I got into the main arc, I had come to appreciate him and eventually through out the 220
                  episodes it was as if I was watching my brother grow up. The show brings a nostalgia, which is something I think is very difficult to achieve, I felt tremendously sad watching the last episode.
Story line up until episode 130 was extremely engaging but after that the fillers spoiled it. The art is standard, it gets the story across but considering the how long ago it was created very understandable. The music of OP and ED were outstanding, I still have the songs in my head till this day and I don't think I will forget them anytime soon. All the characters have at least one good attribute (shout out to kakashi hatake, he made the show completely worth watching). I recommend this greatly, just give it sometime to grow on you.

                The series would be alot more entertaining if it got to the point and stuck to the storyline. Too much of the series is made up of fillers that get old fast, while all the over exighted Sasuke fangirls want to know about is whatever happens to their preacious dickhead Uchiha, etc.
The beginning is boring but it gets much more interesting later in the game. It also gets way better once you get past the enormous brick of fillers and into shippuden. 
But I'll warn anyone who hasn't seen it right now, the fandom is huge and intimidating. Don't be a noob. Get your facts
                  straight before you post about anything, and for heavens sake its &quot;NAA-ROO-TOE&quot; not &quot;NUH-RU-DO&quot;",6
"
                Pros: everything, but only up to about the first 50 episodes (plus the clashes between the 3 legendary shinobidos later on)
Cons: everything since then
The anime is well viewed and understood. It thus does not require synoptic reviews. I'll just share some personal experience with the anime.
I started watching the series a lot later than most people, but once I started, I had no trouble comprehending the frenzies my friends would have about the series -- a tale of ninja and their mysterious techniques (grown up in China, I love all things elemental-related when it comes to magics and fantasies), a depiction of the hierarchy and
                  conflicts in the Japanese Warring era, and a ballard of growing-up with tears, efforts and friendship. It was an awesome escape from the real world, with either new shinobido techniques or new character stories to reveal every episode-- there is always mystery, suspension, and action.
However, (as with all things, there has to be a ""however""), that's only up to about 60 episodes, if I recall right. After that, the series is reduced to episodic missions that do not further the storyline or introduce any new techniques. The motifs of each small story are boring and blank at best. The whole series simply turned into a repetitive, dungeon-ish, adventure anime probably only geared for grade-schoolers.
Just to name one of its vice, it occurs in every single episode that some character, in a super intensive, emergent and often life-threatening situation (as depicted by the character's monologue anyway), would somehow freeze and take ages to make the simplest decision or the most obvious tactical observation -- as if the viewers all have IQ of none when viewing this series. What does the anime itself do during all these pauses? About 7 seconds zooming in on the same frame. And then? Another 7 seconds zooming out! If not longer!!
It's almost sever to the point that I can barely enjoy the episodes as animations but instead voiced CG drama.
I gave up after a few episodes of those, obviously. I would revisit the series occasionally and only receive disappointment - not to anybody's surprise.
Hence, my overall rating -> 3/10, in a protest against the inattention of the producer to the later part of the series, while the partial ratings remain high, in a tribute to the series' quickly-diminished potential.
EDIT:
Unlike normal rating, the word clause remains neutral/positive until the score is lower to as bad as 3 when writing a comment -> partly the reasons for the low score.",3

                I don't mean to be cruel but naruto was a total idiot at the beginning of the anime, and was clumsy. He wasn't a very good ninja until the rest of the anime started showing naruto learning new skills, and growing more mature. Naruto I must say is the best ninja anime Ive watched in fact the only ninja anime I have watched. What is really cool about naruto is that he holds the nine tail fox inside him. So to be honest its a great anime. I enjoyed watching all the episodes of naruto, and I belive in naruto nya!!",6

                Note: I didn't watch this when I was a kid and I haven't watched Shippuden as of yet either, but I'm sure it must have fixed some of the problems in the original. 
Pros:
-easy to follow story
-entertaining side characters
-good use of soundtrack
-well choreographed fights
Cons:
-sakura is annoying af
-half the show is filler
-some villains not that well developed-sub par acting for most of the cast
Best Characters: Kakashi, Jiraiya, Gaara
Worst Characters: Sakura, Ino, Tenten
Overall: 7/10
It didn't make me want to take a cold shower after watching, but it wasn't very good either. It had some nice visuals for it being from 2002",7

                Naruto is way over-ally overrated!
That's what you wanted to read, right? I say its only a little bit overrated. Its famous because its original. Leave it alone. You can not say some else's opinion is worse than yours. Its pretty lame to knock down the majority of opinions for your own. Its only a bit overrated because it does not have the best music or art. It has average art and cheesy music. But the story is developed quite nicely and it gets your heart pumping. Enjoyment is the most important thing here. What other reason would you watch an anime for? 
Story: The story
                  is amazing! You cannot knock naruto down. There are ninjas with special powers they made themselves! The main character has a sad setup too! It makes it all the more interesting.  It even has a world economy built into the story! I know there are only villages in each country, but that's okay. I'd say there are weak points in the story though. There are a couple electronics in this society and hospitals which does not make sense because they do not have cars or planes or ships. It also does not tell us what planet naruto is on or what time period it is based in. 
Art: I thought the art was pretty average. It was not spectacular (especially on episode 1) but it was bearable. I thought the noses and ears of the characters looked pretty weird. Ah! Annoying to look at. The fight scenes were pretty awesome and well done though. The art in them was amazing, and made the scenes all the more interesting to watch.  
Sound: Hmm.. I say it's fairly done. I thought it was pretty cheesy, but I got attached to it. The soundtrack fits really well with what anime it's going with though. It moves the anime along quite well. If you listen to the songs without watching the anime though, you may find them quite boring or weird. The openings and endings of the show have really well done music in them. I     enjoyed all the intro and outro songs. Hopefully you do as well. 
Character development: This is not poorly done, but i'd say it lacks a lot. In the second series of naruto,there is a whole lot more development. I just don't understand why they had to have such average development in the first series. There is hardly any character development with anyone besides the main characters. I know you will probably disagree, but it's true. Many are left with a bad after taste after watching this first show. Its really hard to understand where some of the characters are going. 
Enjoyment: This series is thoroughly enjoyable. It has a lot of fillers yes, but the fillers are quite enjoyable too. The fillers made me laugh hell of a lot, or made me feel relief from the intensiveness of the real story. It may make a lot of people complain of how repetitive this show can get, but i feel it adds to it. Its not bad to repeat ideas and expand on them. It's only impatient people who get frustrated with repetition.  
Overall, it's a good watch. I recommend it to anyone who has time on their hands and wants to watch an upbeat show. It's fairly interesting, and never gets boring (at least for me.).  
Warning: There are huge fillers everywhere in the show. Without them there would only be 140 episodes... not 220. I suggest you skip them and maybe watch them later when you run out of everything naruto. Do whatever you want.",7

                So ever since I started watching Naruto - I've read the manga, and only recently decided to give the anime a go - I've been, for some reason, unconsciously comparing it to Shingeki no Kyojin - my all-time favourite manga.
After the first episode of Naruto, I gave the show an 8. It was good. I'll give you that. The majority of anime don't get any more than a 6 from me usually. Shingeki no Kyojin, after the first episode, also got an eight. But I only changed that 8 to a 9 after the tenth Naruto episode, while Shingeki no Kyojin's eight turned into an
                  immediate 10 after the second episode. Now, why is that? I'll try and explain.
Firstly: sfx and music. The atmosphere set up in Shingeki no Kyojin by the music accompaniments is absolutely flawless. In Naruto, I find that those things aren't as good. Some of the sfx and music are cliché. A lot of the 'touching' moments are filmed in such a terrible way that I couldn't decide if the show-makers intended us to understand it an a parodied way or a serious way. Maybe that's just me. But oh well, we all have our personal opinions.
Secondly: characters. This may be because I've read the manga previously, but I feel that the characters in Naruto, from the very first episodes of the manga, are very predictable, excepting a few choice moments. In SNK, there is no such thing. Every new development is a surprise. Every twist, every turn of the wrist and every trip decision comes as a complete shock.
Thirdly: direction of plot. One of the first things we hear Naruto say is that he wants to become the next Hokage. Since the show is named after him, we can safely assume, even from the first episode, that he will surmount all the coming obstacles and ascend to the position of Godaime no matter what obstacles lie in his path. I like the show, I really do. BUT THAT'S BORING. I don't like 'predictable' things - one of the reasons I prefer Shingeki no Kyojin. With SNK's plot, and with its developments, we have no idea whether or not killing the titans will ever be achieved. The main character's - Eren's - goal is to discover the outside world, and to do that he has to destroy the titans. He has no choice in the matter. It's that or getting killed. But with the number of deaths within the main characters and supporting characters, we could just as well safely assume that he'll get killed himself before he can even find out what the heck it was that his father left in his basement. Hell, even as I speak, Eren is being held captive in some rich guy's basement and about to be eaten by one of his best friends. And there seems to be no possible way out of it. A lot of the fans agree that it's possible he - the main character - will die. Naruto dying? Not possible. Never even considered. There can be no NARUTO without Naruto.
Fourthly: this last one is personal taste, but I tend to prefer really serious mangas/animes with very few comic relief (Sacha and Connie are two of the only comic relief characters in SNK, while ALL of Naruto's characters provide comic relief), heavy plot, manipulations, intrigues, and whatnot. I find that Naruto (the show, not the character, because Naruto Uzumaki is one of the characters I relate to the most in any anime) has TOO much comic relief, and takes TONNES away from the beauty and intensity that could be the show.
There's more, but I can't think how to put it into words. I tried my best not to give any SNK spoilers. No names.
Hope this is helpful to anyone who's been thinking the same thing or was looking for a comparison of the two. If you want to contact me to talk about this, or for any other reason, actually, then do! I'd be glad to meet someone new.",9

                Naruto had been really hyped up before I had even clicked episode one, so I was expecting a lot. When I started it I loved it but when I got to the end, it got really boring. Was it worth watching? Defiantly. Did I enjoy myself? Yes and will I watch Shippuuden? Yes. But that isn't what makes me kind of dislike this anime. 
The story for this anime is great. Ninja's are awesome and all the missions they went on were very interesting until the end of the show. Now, the main villain is Orochimaru, one of the best and scariest anime villains I
                  have seen thus far and whenever he was on screen was the highlight of the show. He was just there and I was invested. He was a huge part for most of it and I found those episodes the best. And then the whole thing with Sasuke went down and we basically never saw him again, and it got boring. All they did for the rest of the anime was go on missions that were not necessary at all. It made me literally fall asleep because I didn't care what was going on. 
The characters were the best part of the series. They all have their unique styles and personalities that make you remember them. The top three that were most memorable, excluding Naruto, were Sasuke, Orochimaru and Gaara. All three of them were so fun to watch on the screen and I never got bored when they showed up. Hinata and Neji are also very interesting alongside Lee. Now of course Naruto, the star of the show. Most of the time he was on screen I was laughing and I was usually cheering for him. Though when Orochimaru came on screen I never really knew who to cheer for. No one hate me but I love Orochimaru, he is one of my favourite characters, behind Neji and in front of Hinata. Like those three, god bless them.
The animation was okay. This was made a while ago so it wasn't the greatest but I've seen worse. Moving to the music, I really liked it. There were some instrumental pieces that were kind of memorable but not as much as I know the music in Shippuuden will be. The openings however always got my attention. They were catchy and fun to sing along to. Especially Go by Flow and Kanashimi o Yasashisa ni by Little by Little. 
Overall I enjoyed watching Naruto, it was just the ending that spoiled it for me. I'll watch the sequel and hopefully love this series even more. Hopefully it'll make up for the last few episodes for this anime.
But I give Naruto a 7/10 since I did enjoy myself. Naruto has 220 episode, half of them not even necessary, and aired in 2002-2007. It is from the studio Pierrot and is adapted from the manga of the same name by Masashi Kishimoto.",7
"
                There is no need to introduce Naruto to anyone. Everybody knows it, even people who are not into anime.
This manga has become extremely popular, and even though it is over, it lasted long.
STORY
As in every long shônen anime, a lot happens in Naruto. We follow the everyday like of Naruto, an orphan rejected by his own village, in this world of shinobis who work for a living taking missions with their team.
We see these Shinobi pass exams to level up, take missions, and fight several threats including Gaara who has a demon inside him, Orochimaru who tries to destroy Konoha, and the Akatsuki, a group
                  with unknown purpose.
Now, the story is what makes Naruto popular. I can understand that. I actually would like the story... if it wasn't so non-concise and full of fillers.
Want an example? Just look at the 80 fillers in the end of the series ; or take a look at the Chunin Exam arc, which lasts 40 episodes (JUST FOR AN EXAM).
Basically, not only Naruto is extremely full of fillers, even the main story is very slow. As a result, it feels like nothing happened. MUCH MORE should have happened in those 220 episodes.
Hell, some anime with 50 episodes or less have as much story as Naruto!
As good as the story sometimes gets, there's just too few (compared with the number of episodes).
ART
Naruto is... not very good. The chara-design is weird and doesn't follow any logic, the drawings are bad and the animation is disgusting.
That said, the art does get better with time.
I like some openings.
SOUND
The OST is very basic, if not bad at all. The themes stick to the Ninja theme, though.
The seiyuus are good.
CHARACTER
That's both the main weakpoint AND the stronghold of Naruto.
- First, let's talk about the secondary characters. They're a bunch of useless crap with no charisma, who sometimes show an interesting attack/power just to try and get the viewer's attention for a bit.
- Then, there are the main characters. The Uchiwas are awesome, and thank god the story revolves a lot around them. Sasuke is often criticized as he is ""just an edgy character"" ; I personally liked following his path into darkness, although I am not a huge fan either.
Sakura is a useless chick and she just doesn't even deserve to be a main character. There's nothing to argue here.
Then, there is Naruto. Ah, Naruto. If he does get an interesting journey, as he evolves through the various dangers he encounters, in this first part of the manga he is a really annoying brat.
Basically, 90% of the characters are useless and uninteresting 95% of the time, and even the main characters are really lackluster as Sakura is useless, Sasuke is too edgy and Naruto is a brat.
Luckily, some characters do stand out, especially Itachi and Kakashi.
But it's not enough to change the fact that the Naruto crew is really screwed up.
ENJOYMENT
I read the manga and did enjoy some parts. I watched the anime and really hated it. As an anime, it fails ; as a story, the huge amount of fillers and the very slow pace makes it really annoying to watch.",3
"
                This is not a professional review, it is a rant. All I want to say is this is one of the most dragged out animes I have ever watched. 30% new content, 30% recaps & flashbacks, 40% fillers.
One fight can take up to 8 episodes easily and unnecessarily. I hated how the anime plays 3-5 fights simultaneously, it just kills the hype completely.
Story seems amazing (which is why I managed to watch the whole thing).
Art is complete crap and the sense of positioning is buggered. One second the two fighters are 3 meters apart, the other second they are 50 meters apart. Yeah this anime
                  came out 453 BC, but Dragonball is older and I don't think I complained as much about its art.",6
"
                Unlike most Naruto fans, I didn't grow up watching it. I never had some kind of emotional connection with it. It was only recently that I decided to watch it, and that was only because everyone was talking about how good it was and blah blah blah. Now, almost a year after I finished the show, Naruto is one of the few anime that I believe is truly outstanding! Don't be scared by the 720 episodes of the franchise. It seems a lot, but it isn't. Watching the first 10-20 episodes of the series didn't give me a different impression; it was just another anime
                  about ninja, I thought! When the actual plot began, I couldn't get myself away from the screen. It was so interesting that I just couldn't help but wanting to know what was going to happen next! But why is Naruto so good? Let's start with the story. It's appears to be pretty simple! The story is set in an alternative world where ninjas exist. It's an easy and believable concept that you don't have to think to much about. Then we have the characters! There are so many characters in the Naruto series, but each of them is so unique, that I can remember everyone's names AND surnames. The main character, Naruto, is not perfect, which is something that makes the series even better. Throughout the series we see his flaws, his troubles, his actions and we also see him grow up and change into a better person. He is not a kid who has a perfect life and wants to be a hero. He has a goal, and a reason for that goal. All that make Naruto's character more realistic and more relatable.
Then we have the Antihero of the series, Sasuke. Sasuke is the exact opposite of Naruto, and at the same time, they are so alike. Sasuke's character is also not perfect. He himself has many flaws and has made many mistakes throughout the series. But what truly makes him a good character is that he ALSO has a reason for his actions. I can't write any of the details because I'm trying not to spoil anything. Moving on to the soundtrack. I am a soundtrack lover. Naruto's soundtrack is unlike anything you have ever heard before. It combines traditional Asian instruments with modern rhythms. The result of that was outstanding. And if you become a fan of this series, some of these soundtracks will stick in your brain for life and whenever you hear it, you'll feel nostalgic. Next we have the Art. Naruto is not a recent anime, so don't expect the highest quality. But to tell you the truth, that didn't matter. At least not to me. I enjoyed the show despite that. Besides, the quality gets better in Shippuden. Finally, the most important feature of not just the show, but the entire franchise, are the hidden meanings and messages it has about life. I often find myself following the examples that Naruto characters set in the series. Overall, I think that the Naruto franchise is a hidden gem among the anime world, and I highly recommend it. It doesn't matter how old you are! I plan to watch it again one day, with my kids. One thing is for certain; Naruto will always have a special place in my heart!",10
"
                For newcomers to anime and for the younger audience, Naruto is a great anime to kickstart your journey.
However, as with many long-running anime, the fillers are absolute garbage. I would have rated it higher, if it stopped after 135.
Also, there were only moments of memorable magic, with the rest being quite forgetable.
My favourite part of the story is Naruto's upbringing and his will to fight. I thought that was quite inspiring.

                Okay, so I was just getting into anime when I came across Naruto. I know that most people start off with animes like Naruto, One Piece, Attack on Titan, and etc and then they move on to different anime and get a general taste in what genre they prefer. What surprised me though is that this anime has always been my absolute favorite, and although I didn't grow up with Naruto like a lot of other people, for me the same feelings come across through watching the show. The world they live in is charming, but can be quite chaotic at times. Each character has
                  their own unique design that complements who they are and their personalities. Each character is different and it is interesting to see what being a ninja means to them. I think the thing I like most about this series is that each character has their own story and preference and how characters grow throughout the series. Like, take Naruto for example, he has always wanted to become Hokage (leader of village) to be acknowledged but he realizes that to be Hokage means to gain the trust of the village. It is amazing to see how much Naruto cares about his friends' well being and how he creates new bonds with the people he meets to be honest it is inspiring to me.  And yes  I do realize that there is a lot of filler but if you don't care about those episodes than just skip it and once you finish all the canon episodes go back and watch the filler. Overall Naruto is a great series for anyone but I recommend it if you are new to anime or if you just love Shonen battle series",10
"
                Let's face it, this is a good shonen anime. The second anime that I had watched in my life (first being Dragonball). Overall I can say, it was a fun experience until I discovered panties, moe, and Evangelion. There are flamers and there are fanboys whose list also include bleach and One Piece and such other shonen animes of the same caliber. Enough about the basics let's get into the review.
Story - Not what everyone wants, but it WORKS. That's the most important part, it WORKS. It's nice and interesting, doesn't have to be as long as it is. Fillers, not so much, i like
                  how they get into the side characters, but there are better ways to do it then just send them on a mission together.
Not so much romance going on. Would've made things more interesting. good at explaining things that happened in the past as such.
Can't approve of all the plot devices used. Some are too cheap and i would have preferred if the story was darker and centered around a sadistic Naruto instead of a headstrong mentally handicapped person.
I give it a 7 - Not bad, did it's job for a shonen and the main plot line is still followable.
Art - Not bad but I've seen a few freeze frames that made me Lol. Not much ecchi or ero shot/Special Effects, so i can't say much. It's pretty basic.
7 - little things here and there. Not phenomenal, passes.
Sound - Again, very basic. fighting sounds were also basic. Music was good. Voice acting, like able. Didn't launch any voice actors into fame.
7 - nothing more to say.
Character: There weren't really any characters i truly disliked in the series. Stupid trolls flaming something they don't understand, fanboys are obsessed based on their primal instincts. Both have little to no grip on what makes a character and that's what makes them the animals they are.
The villains appealed more to me than the main characters. They had more darker, complicated back stories that i sympathized with and had taken a liking to.
There were way too many characters than there needed to be. Either have them be an iconic background character or make them a main character. You can only have so much in the supporting role.
Their pasts are very basic and I'm not going to review it on a level of a person who has seen some deep stuff and is very experienced with those sort of tropes. The people watching this should be little kids that should be educated on these sorts of story structure and understand how they work. This anime does what is needed. And the lack of character depth is probably to appeal to a younger audience as well as well as release as many games, toys, and cosplay costumes as possible. That fact however doesn't come on as strong though.
I had some favorites which means this deserves nothing less than a 7, some bad some good, balances it out. If i had taken out all the characters i disliked i would've given it at least an 8.
Enjoyment - Did I enjoy it? No, this differs from viewer to viewer and to me I wouldn't have the attention span to stay in my chair to watch this. Instead I'd be watching this while doing something else in the background, not even caring to read the subs.
This is something I'd give to my younger siblings to get them started on anime. They would love this stuff, and it'll prepare them for better animes by setting the bar very low on the first time. Watching a masterpiece as the first anime, really takes the luster away from the animes you would have enjoyed if you hadn't watched this first.
So always watch this first before you go into Code Geass.
6 - and this won't affect the overall score this is completely unrelated.
This is indeed better than Bleach (a lukeworm anime that excels no direction in particular, read my review for it).
Overall grade - 7
I think it's great for it to be as overrated as this is. It's basically the front gate for newcomers in to the anime universe, and being the position as it's in, i'd prefer to have it as overrated as possible. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for this anime. I wish it luck in it's future stories.
Let the little kids have fun, we can enjoy it from time to time in nostalgia, but I don't recommend it to anyone who wants deep story. If you don't like it, take it to a youtube video.

                Before I realy became an anime fan, I diddent want to watch Naruto at all, because it was too main stream. But then after watching Naruto I thought, why not watch more of this great story so now I cant wait to the next episodes of naruto Shippuden to come out online.
I liked this anime because its thrilling, funny and have a very great story all is planned out and lots of flash backs to tell when something is important happend and if you missed it. 
Great, Great series and I don't ever regret watching this anime. 
If you want to watch go ahead and
                  enjoy",10

                Just skip the fillers and you'll most likely watch the best shonen out there. I finished the complete Naruto series within 2 months. Without the fillers you still need to watch around 400 episodes but you'll never get bored even once. It's a true masterpiece.
The soundtrack alone is just perfect, it fits every scene perfectly! Furthermore you get a perfect japanese dubbing, each voice is unique and acted out superbad. The story is one of the most meaningful ever created.
Overall as I stated before it really is a masterpiece. Of course it has flaws but overall you'll get to see some of the best villains
                  ever created (all of them carry a superior motivation, noone is just plain evil), the twists are really breathtaking and you get great character development as well (even the smallest siderole gets the time it deserves to fill that person with life).
You won't regret it, I promise. It's due to the fillers that a lot of people dropped it so you are lucky now being able to circumvent them and to enjoy the canon story to it's whole extent.",10

                Naruto = my first anime. Thanks to this series I became an anime fan. It's my soul series. To refer only to Naruto: It's not really a masterpiece in terms of action, at least in the second part, at least from my point of view. However, it outlines the personality of the characters very well. The main characters receive a lot of attention.
As for the number 1 person, so to speak: Naruto - is the unpolished diamond. Childish, a little lazy at first (as if describing me from childhood) but who never gives up (""my ninja way""). Although at the exams Chunnin showed what his
                  skin can do, in the rest of the series he did not stand out, he did not show the same intensity in his actions. The fight with Sasuke being, in my opinion, the last fight in this series. After that fight Naruto becomes obsessed with Sasuke but does not show a major improvement and in some places he looked like a big fool; but he showed us all his attitude and soul in all its splendor.
The action: As he said earlier, the series became pale after the fight between Naruto and Sasuke, in the end we had a bit more of the action, but which was outlined more around Gaara.
Music: At that time I don't think there was much value on the soundtrack, at least I didn't do it. But always the sad songs (parts of songs) touched my soul.
For better or worse, the series was gorgeous, just like the main character: an unpolished diamond that prepared us for the next series.",10

                Naruto is one of the best story lines no one will tell you otherwise. However i feel like if someone knew nothing about Naruto and just watched the first few episodes they may find it a bit too childish but i ashore you if you can battle threw the first few episodes you will find out why people of all ages love this story so much and hopefully they make it to shippuden for a even more enjoyable experience. there are some darker moments to the show that give many a new perspective on life its almost like watching a motivational video as well as
                  a very well done story its a long story but definitely worth the watch. 8/10",8

                This review contain minor spoilers
Naruto is the very first manga I have seen and I think it's time for me to give an objective review of the serie. And despite many people gave Naruto low scores, I'll explain why I give it a 9. 
Story: 8
First of all, if you want to enjoy Naruto, skip all the fillers, they are not part of the story and it won't hurt to skip them.
The story of naruto is outstanding considering it is one of the first long shounen series out there. I will not tell the story in detail but it is basically about main character naruto's
                  path to prove himself and defend his friendship with sasuke. If you have seen a lot of shounen animes, then you would probably realise that many other animes have their story background or several arcs based on Naruto, Boku no hero academy' tournament arc and attack on titan's background of a titan broke into nine pieces. I would say that naruto may not have the best plot considering all the animes that came out after it, but it is definitely one of the best when it was airing. Please do consider this while rating it. Apart from that, most of the arcs in Naruto are super exciting, I will not spoil here, but if you consider Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden as a whole, you will realize that the whole story is very well structured.
Art: 6
I gave Naruto's art 6 because again, at the same time you are saying about contemporary anime's great animation, please do bear in mind that Naruto came out several years ago, it is simply not fair to compare Naruto's art to other animes that came out decades after. Though I have to admit that from contemporary perspective, naruto's art is not good. If you really can't bear the animation, I suggest you read the manga instead, it is much better and I would not recommend you to drop the serie just because of animation. 
Sound: 9
I do like all the voice actors. Naruto's OPs are also fantastic, no need to explain more.
Character: 10
Now this is the best part of Naruto in my opinion. Though Naruto is a typical protagonist, hot-blooded, works hard and has some gifts given to him, but you could see his change from the begining to the end, the way he viewed friendship and responsibility. Sasuke, in my opinion, is a very -well built character, all of his actions are reasonable, and I don't understand why people are saying they don't understand sasuke's change from a revenger to Naruto's ally, it is probably because they just did not pay much attention to the story, as someone who finished all the manga and anime about Naruto, I promise you what they are saying are not the case. 
Side characters are also great, particularly members of the Akatsuki; now these are typical example of good villains, they don't do ""evil"" for the sake of doing evil, but rather have their complex mindset and way of viewing the world. Each of them carries a different dream like love, peace, childhood, etc. It sometimes makes you question whether or not they are the evil. 
Enjoyment: 10
I definitely enjoyed the serie, but if you don't insist on watching animes I would rather recommend you to read manga instead, it is much more enjoyable. 
Overal: 9
Great anime, but received many unjust ratings just because fillers and aged animation, which in my opinion, are just unfair to Naruto",7
"
                There are so many reasons to love the classic Naruto. The very first reason is the character Naruto himself. He is a young boy who is very immature. As the show progresses he begins to grow up. It is so fun to see him develop into a true shinobi. While the show focuses on Naruto he is not the only character who develops. There are many characters who you will fall in love with along the way. As far as the story goes it is quite compelling to a certain extent. What I mean by that is it tends to drag on a little bit.
                  While on this note one downside to this anime is the number of filler episodes. It seems like once most of the show is done (around 3/4) the filler episodes go full force. The only problem with this is it has nothing to do with the main plot. So for that reason, I have lowered the overall score.",8
"
                Naruto is the anime that accompanied me from my childhood to adolescence until early adulthood, and I feel the series have a lot of love because of this personal experience from the fans.
The story is typical of a hero (Naruto) passing through various difficulties and challenges, but the ninja world, all the jutsus and emotive moments give the show its uniqueness.
Every character has a distinct personality, and the episodes present you different perspectives of goof and evil, right and wrong, and of course Naruto trying to convince them to change their ways, and being influenced and growing out of those experiences. All of that is
                  covered with a lot of action, fights, and mysterious stuff.
I recommend that you watch it all, even if you feel the first episodes art is crap, because they are the foundation for your attachment to the characters.
Highly recommended.",9
"
                Nostalgia is probably pumping up my ratings here haha. Naruto (excluding fillers, please if you're gonna watch skip them because this is a long ass series and they don't really add anything to the story in my opinion) is a really good story when it starts out. As a shounen genre type thing I really liked the exploration of darker themes with ultimately good messages. The character development is interesting, the story is engaging, and it it gives you characters to root for. It can be funny, it can be sad. It's enjoyable and a really common gate way anime. That being said it was
                  originally made for younger audiences and is by no means a true masterpiece of any kind. If you look too much into it you're gonna find a ton of plot holes (and this increases doubly in Shippuden and x100 for anything post that) so enjoy it for what it is. It isn't romance based but the fandom in general is pretty focused on that, so keep that in mind. If you get into a Naruto kick the music is gonna stay with you, it's pretty great!",7
"
                If you tell someone who watches anime that you do as well, it's simply assumed this is one of those shows you've both seen, right? Well I've watched since dubs weren't really a thing if that gives you an idea of how old I am, and I'd somehow never gotten around to watching Naruto. IDK how or why, it just never happened. When I saw Netflix had it available and I had some time to kill I figured ""Why not?"" I thought with how long it had been around and the perceived impression, it had to be at least DECENT, right? RIGHT? 
No.The setting's weird
                  as hell. Is it the future? The past? An alternate timeline? WTF? They walk everywhere because I guess cars don't exist, but indoor plumbing and electricity, do? ""Maybe I'm just being picky,"" I thought. ""You're getting hung up on that, but not talking frogs that are bigger than most houses, who magically appear by doing magic gang signs? OK then."" I stuck it out for over 100 episodes mostly on the collective ""anime classic"" status I thought it had (I generally tried to avoid conversation about this because I didn't want to sound like some kind of anime hipster because I'd never seen one of the most famous). So onto the characters:
Naruto - actually not THAT bad (although, let's be real: a young teenage boy with the ability to create temporary clones, make them look however he wants - including his first one ""Sexy Jutso"" where he makes himself look like your standard anime female, and if you think he would be interested in doing anything other than wanking off 24/7, you're delusional). He's your typical anime protagonist: a lazy screw-up who thinks he's the best despite all evidence to the contrary, but because he decides he REALLY wants it, and now apparently enough to actually work for it - then he's gonna be the greatest! (Well that and the fact that he keeps getting access to WAY more powerful magic gang signs most other people don't know and because they don't have a young priest and an old priest there to EXORCISE THE DEMON).
Sauske - Your typical edgelord rival. Seriously, if you've ever played D&D (don't act like there's not a lot of overlap between that and anime. Stop lying to yourself), ya know ""THAT guy?"" The one who always plays a rogue with resting bitchface who is attracted like a magnet to the corner of whatever room he's in? The kind with a backstory so dark you can tell they did it just to one-up Batman? The one who would list brooding and standing on rooftops looking into the distance as his favorite pastimes? That's this guy (putting the tryhard edgelord in shortpants was the ballsiest thing they did with his entire character).
Sakura - just a basic bitch who gets moist everytime gothboy appears just like every other basic bitch in this show. Seriously, can SOMEONE get this girl a glass of water because DAMN she's thirsty!
The sad thing about all this is each of these characters had their own little chance in terms of a few episodes that focused solely on them, to become a deeper character and like the background in a Scooby-Doo chase scene, the creators decided ""Fuck it. Changing that up a little sounds suspiciously like work. Just loop it over and over; nobody'll notice.""
The plot: So... yeah, I guess this show's main plot is these heroes taking care of their little village, although WTF anybody else would care about it, is never really explained. So maybe it's about the individual character arcs then? Well Tropeboy's only goal is to be leader of this village just so everybody there will quit treating him like the plague because he has a demon inside him, even though once he starts to give a crap and becomes a 1/2way decent ninja, nobody really gives him shite anymore, so you stop caring about his goal since he's basically already made it. Basic bitch really has no backstory except a history of being a tsundere to the MC, while creaming her shorts everytime Gothboy walks into the room. Making his story the best by default, which isn't something to be proud of. 
All in all, if you don't want to feel like you're a weirdo upon meeting other weeaboos, then sure - watch it. But if you're just looking for a GOOD anime to watch, pass.     
EDIT: So being in lockdown, I took a 2nd look at this review when a friend who DIDN'T know how I felt about this anime recommended it to me. I figured: ""Why not? It's not like I have anything better to do."" I stuck it out a little longer and there was a pretty big event that happens which changes the entire dynamic of the show where one of the main characters is out of the picture for the most part for quite a while. I won't say that it makes it a GREAT anime, but it does change the feel of the story a LOT so I think that after this major change is why a lot of people think so highly of it. Also once they switch over to... I guess you'd call it the ""2nd chapter?"" the story DOES get a lot better when they do a time skip to Naurto Shippuden and you find the kids of the story have at least somewhat matured a bit. I don't know if I would go so far as to say I'd recommend it, but if you HAVE started this before and you can manage to make it through the beginning part, then don't put in the time and effort of seeing the beginning then give up on it just when it makes a major change which at least SOMEWHAT gives a payoff for all that effort.
2nd EDIT: So they did it to me again. I've pinned down what, or rather WHO it is that I can't stand in this show. Once they got rid of them for a while, the show was INSTANTLY a lot better to watch... then they bring them back... and do 20 episodes of flashback filler so you don't even get the slightly more mature and palatable version...

                In America, Naruto is without a doubt the most overrated, overhyped anime of my generation. Everyone has heard of Naruto. However, since I didn’t start seriously watching anime until a few years ago, I didn’t grow up on this anime like many others did. The nostalgia factor isn’t there for me, so I feel like I’m able to give a non-biased review. Needless to say, because of the endless praise I’d heard my friends and peers give the anime, my expectations were extremely high. Unfortunately, I found Naruto to be a vast disappointment. I hate to admit the only reason I pushed past episode 20
                  was so my opinion of the show would be more “valid” in the eyes of my youngest brother, who adores Naruto. If you’re a fan of Naruto, I’m sorry—this review won’t be a kind one.
Story: 3
I didn’t care much for the story. I wouldn’t necessarily say that the story itself was bad, only that I couldn’t find myself becoming invested as it progressed. I will say, that the main selling point of the story is supposed to be that Naruto is excluded by his peers because of the fox spirit inside him, and aims to become the strongest to prove them wrong. However, by the Chunin exams, it’s perfectly clear that those who don’t like him dislike him because he’s annoying. I found it hard to blame them.
Art: 7
The art of this show is probably the thing I think the highest of. I appreciated the use of color, especially the pop of Naruto’s orange jumper and the pink of Sakura’s hair. The character designs were one of the main highlights for me, especially the naturally proportioned bodies of the girls; it’s typical in a lot of shōnen anime and manga that the girl characters will have slim waists and large breasts, but here the bodies of characters looked rather realistic. Points for that, Naruto. 
Sound: 7
I had no issues with the voice acting (I watched this English subbed). I did find some of the music used in the show to be a little annoying, particularly a piano riff used in the background when people were fighting.
Characters: 3
This is where Naruto suffers the most. The main character is perhaps the worst offender: while they were aiming for the “lovable idiot” character type, they missed the mark. While he is, indeed, an idiot, he is far from loveable—he is arrogant, annoying, obnoxious, and arguably selfish. Whenever I bring this up to fans of the show, they always tell me “He’s so much better in Shippuden” or some variation of telling me to wait for Shippuden. In what world is it feasible to wait 220 episodes from the main character of a TV show to become likeable, let alone bearable? Don’t get me wrong, he has his moments, but for 90% of the time he was an utter nuisance. The rest of the characters aren’t much better—most of them are one-dimensional and paper thin. The biggest flaws came from the female characters, whose sole characteristic the majority of the time was their interest in a male character.
Enjoyment: 3
Naruto does have its moments. However, I feel it’s fair to say my enjoyment was relatively low. Since there didn’t seem to be a category fit for me to mention this, I’ll put it here: I hate toilet humor. Despise it. So, when there were scenes where Naruto was on the toilet suffering from diarrhea or accidentally farted during a fight, or characters were seen vomiting for comedic effect, I didn’t find it funny, but rather eye-rollingly annoying. 
I have a hard time believing this is the same show people are praising so much. This is it? I can understand the nostalgia factor that most have, but for others like my brother who watched it within the past year or so, I’m surprised. Knowing that this was the show that made him hate on the likes of My Hero Academia and One Piece irritates me in a way I can’t properly express.
Despite feeling a low-level anger whenever I watch it, I’ll finish this damn series… I’ll watch every last canon episode, for this and Shippuden… for the spiteful fact of strengthening my argument and being able to back up my reasoning of disliking it, so my brother can’t tell me my opinion or argument is invalid.
Overall: 5
5/10 might change as I continue on. It’s over-hyped and over-rated, lower your expectations if you’re wishing to watch it. I recommend watching something else, particularly a better shōnen like One Piece, My Hero Academia, Demon Slayer, or Jujutsu Kaisen.",5
"
                Okay, to be honest, I can't really say anything because so many people have already reviewed & watched Naruto. However, I can say a couple of things.
First, Naruto has an amazing plot line. Yes, there are way too many fillers, however, the plot itself, the ninja, it's all unique to Naruto alone.
Second, the characters are awesome. They make you cry and laugh and shout at them for their stupidity. They feel almost real.
Third, I just want to say that honestly, a lot of people say Naruto is cliched, and it might be in our eyes, where anime is hugely popular. But when Naruto was first
                  published, it created the cliches - the weak-strong MC ( ect Izuku Midoriya from BHNA ), the two rivals, one naturally talented, one weak ( ect Yuno and Asta from Black Clover ) and the typical cool, black-haired guy ( Ray from The Promised Neverland ).",8
"
                Naruto is one of those animes that is really well known has a huge following. 
I've attempted to watch it for years but failed in a couple attempts. But thanks to netflix i have finally been able to watch the entire series. Well minus the filler i skipped those episodes. 
The show starts out and i hated the lead character he was loud and annoying and seemed to repeat the same lines a ridiculous amount. As the show went i would say i had passing interest until around the episode 50 mark in the series. 
The characters seemed to really start to develop around this
                  point. In the chuein exam arc in particular. Naruto himself gradually became less annoying. Sakura slowly faded to the background before disapearing almost completly. 
I found that supporting cast was actually moe likeable then the main cast. Kikashi was two scoops of awesome but their would be long spans of time he would completly disappear from the show. this would happen with pretty much everyone except Naruto. 
One problem was that some fights would drag on way too long. One in particular that featured a character death took so long that the impact of this characters death was completly lost. This was something id call dbz syndrome where a character over explains their moves. 
Another thing that came up alot is that it seemed during every battle a character would say ""i have used up all of my chakra"" or something around those lines it got to a ridiculous point that i joked about it with a friend. 
I think what holds this series back is the fact that it drags things out too much. In the same way dragonball z did. The fights that are the most enjoyable are the more all out action fights. There were fights that did last multiple episodes that were fantastic like the last ""main"" fight of the series that the animators seemed to bring beyond their a game and during that series of episodes itself i would give a ten for the arc as things just looked beautiful. 
The story had some great moments and if some things werent dragged out like i think that if the show were cut it half we probably wouldnt lose alot. 
All in all i would recommend this show it may not live up to the hype some people give it but it does have its moments it is worth a viewing if you have the time i would suggest finding a filler list to skip filler episodes though.",6
"
                This series starts off rather well, sets the story right and develops everyone's character at a simple level and everyone's ninja powers well.
As the anime progresses it becomes crucial that you like Naruto's unwavering and blindly confident character. If not his odd speeches will get annoying and like myself you will often find minor characters a lot more interesting and you wish you could see more of them, or even if they were the main character instead. One of the cons may be that there are so many characters that the inclusion of all of them is difficult. With that, developing those many characters can
                  mess with the pacing of the anime.
When some side characters get into fights, the back story of them is then included within the fight which can get annoying and for many of the characters I really don't care about which made me skip most of their back stories.
The story it self has a direction but the reader doesn't really have an idea of where it's going. Both good and bad so it's hard to tell what will happen next while knowing the characters are progressing.
The animation is fine until fights start, when they move at a high speeds the animation gets quite annoying with faces and bodies getting distorted.
It's a hard anime to follow but for some reason I stick with it and is probably my most followed animes as well as being one I know most about. I continue to watch for my liking of the minor characters and ninja fights.",6
"
                In one paragraph, here's a review from someone who watched Naruto as a newbie but is now a relatively experienced anime fan:
Naruto is the first anime that I ever watched. Sure - it's not like any of the current mainstream anime (under 30 episodes). It doesn't have the intellectual intensity, dynamic story line, quick and intense character development, and other factors are common in all great anime today. It's quite long at some times, there are some annoying fillers, and its been going on for over 15 years. But, at least for me, that is what makes it great! See, spending time on this show,
                  watching the characters actually grow as time passes, enjoying the strong moments and sobering through the sad ones is what makes this show appealing to so many young people across the world. Naruto has all the elements of an anime meant to show the beauty of life - not to delve into an intellectual or emotional rollercoaster. I might even say that some of the important decisions that I have made in life may have been inspired by this show. 
Undoubtedly, I will continue to watch Naruto, Boruto, or whatever comes despite how good or useless it is - think of this as a testament to what this show means to me and so many others.",10
"
                This show was pretty much the masterpiece. (Maybe Minor spoilers)
I love how the creator showed the background of characters, and especially home they came to be this way. I also like how Naruto Shipuden was made, especially with the growth of characters and abilities. 
One thing I personally dislike is the fact that people keep comparing all the other characters from Naruto to Naruto and Sasuke themselves. Honestly, that shouldn't be done. Those two are practically gods and have either a beast or sharing within them. Also, even through I got used to rock lee, I personally am not very fond of him and his
                  looks. Sure, you can't judge a book by its cover and not all people are exceptionally beautiful, but its quite bothersome. But, I'm glad that me and most other people got used to it over-time, especially when he sometimes makes people laugh of comedy and laugh out of second hand embarrassment, either way it is still a laughter. Also, sure it's okay and funny when Naruto is acting silly, but I feel like it should be less constant. But it seems okay this way as well. 
Not only that, but it made me laugh how when you stop, sometimes there are funny points in the animation. All in all, the animation itself looks swift to me, but it's funny when you stop in the middle of an animation. Sure, for some people that may be annoying, so my advice for you is just: don't pause in the middle of an animation or simply don't look. 
In the shipped, there were some boring moments which had nothing but fights between the background characters which was quite annoying, which is why I dropped it at a point only to return later caring for more. I also hate how they dragged out things in both Shippuden and Naruto, but at the same time its understandable. They wanted to focus a lot of attention on the characters, and make the watchers develop feelings for each of the characters. 
At the same time, I hate how they showed the females in the show. Basically, their whole personality revolves around their crushes. It's personally not fair, because all we know about them is their personality when they are around their crush and how they feel about their crush, and that their crush is what makes them act ""shy"" or ""angry all the time"". However, they did some justice to the the males in the very least. 
The shippuden was amazing, and I hope people enjoyed it as much as I did!",10

You gotta watch Naruto. It has a total of 220 episodes but without fillers it's around 100.
( skip the fillers, the good ones are in Shippuden, not here )
First off, you're gonna know the name of everyone from his village which is pretty cool to begin with.
You'll find the hand seals pretty satisfying and most characters come out as very cool and chill.
Each character brings something very significant to the table.
The action is epic and it's pretty funny at times. The walk through Naruto's life is emotional occasionally but really gets you motivated, dattebayo! 
The protagonist Uzumaki Naruto defies limit time and time again,
                  it's heartwarming. Story of Uchiha Sasuke is one you'd not wanna miss.
With that said, you must watch Naruto Shippuden too, 500 Eps but less than 350 without fillers, though some are good.
Shippuden is just sooo much better.( flashbacks are outrageous )
I'd say Naruto is the ladder to get to the real deal that is Naruto Shippuden but don't get me wrong, Naruto is not to be underestimated. 
There are two fights which are on par with the greatest fights in Narutoverse.( You'll understand once you see them )
The hype for villains is unparalled 
The OP's( Opening Sequences ) are pretty dope too!.
I hope you actually get into the Narutoverse coz of my elaborate recommendation. I believe i have hyped it enough for you without any spoilers, although with spoilers his would have been 4x easier.
Enjoy Watching !",9

                There is no need to introduce Naruto to anyone. Everybody knows it, even people who are not into anime.
This manga has become extremely popular, and even though it is over, it lasted long.
As in every long shônen anime, a lot happens in Naruto. We follow the everyday like of Naruto, an orphan rejected by his own village, in this world of shinobis who work for a living taking missions with their team.
We see these Shinobi pass exams to level up, take missions, and fight several threats including Gaara who has a demon inside him, Orochimaru who tries to destroy Konoha, and the Akatsuki, a group
                  with unknown purpose.
Now, the story is what makes Naruto popular. I can understand that. I actually would like the story... if it wasn't so non-concise and full of fillers.
Want an example? Just look at the 80 fillers in the end of the series ; or take a look at the Chunin Exam arc, which lasts 40 episodes (JUST FOR AN EXAM).
Basically, not only Naruto is extremely full of fillers, even the main story is very slow. As a result, it feels like nothing happened. MUCH MORE should have happened in those 220 episodes.
Hell, some anime with 50 episodes or less have as much story as Naruto!
As good as the story sometimes gets, there's just too few (compared with the number of episodes).",1
"
Given the voracity of the backlash against the “not-so-bad” rating that Naruto received upon initial viewing by a fellow reviewer, I am certain that many readers eagerly anticipate a reviewer that, upon broader viewing (or even being of dissimilar gender from the original critic), will vindicate their pristine opinion of this title. Unfortunately you, the reader, are stuck with me. While I don’t think poorly of this title by any stretch of the imagination, the buzz pervading Naruto is plainly more hype than substance.
So where does the hype begin you ask? Right off the bat. From the very beginning of episode one this title more
                  or less pronounces itself to be of the cookie-cutter Shonen Jump variety, and only a somewhat above average one at that. The character for which the show is named, Naruto, is quickly introduced, and even before the end of the first episode the viewer is completely aware of the ultimate direction of the plot: Naruto will someday become the strongest ninja of his village and receive the highly coveted title of Hokage. But knowing the end of the plotline isn’t as much of a killjoy as one would expect. It is the ride that counts after all. However, in the case of Naruto the ride is tantamount to that of an old, wooden roller coaster: sometimes thrilling and often nostalgic, yet still quite a bit rickety and easily outdone in terms of excitement and quality.
The characters, like the plot, are mostly OK while being admittedly cliched. Uzumaki Naruto, our primary character, is much like the leads of many of the most popular fight-styled anime. Like Goku (of Dragon Ball fame), Naruto is headstrong, motivated (mostly to become stronger), and cares deeply about his comrades. Like Yuusuke (of Yu Yu Hakusho fame), Naruto is rambunctious, brash, and a bit of a slacker. Despite his being particularly formulaic, Naruto at least combines the finer qualities of his predecessors. Such can not be said of his archrival Sasuke, a figure for whom blandness knows no depth. In fact, many of the characters fall somewhere in-between Sasuke’s blandness and Naruto’s charisma and coolness. You will come to care for the cast of Naruto for sure, just not at any deep or meaningful level.
The animation, much like the characterization and plotting, is spotty. At times great while at other times shoddy, the quality of the animation here lacks any real consistency. During the arcs in which the animation is still on the minds of the animators, the viewer is treated to a fluid frame-rate and artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga. Nevertheless, when the animation is bad it is painful. At these times the once faithful renderings degrade to craptastic levels. It is as if you can feel the framerates slipping before your very eyes. Like most aspects thus far examined, the animation of Naruto is a mixed bag indeed.
It is perhaps a bit unfair though to judge a fight/action anime based upon factors such as characterization and plotting. True to its genre, it is in fight/action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades, though that isn’t saying a whole hell of a lot. Despite very wide employment, the fight scenes manage to remain remarkably fresh. With such a large extended cast, invigorating and unique fighting styles/techniques manage to continuously infuse action sets with life. Additionally, the background music manages to add some tension to these scenes quite effectively. There are some negative aspects to the action sets however. One is the overemployment of certain special techniques, particularly Naruto’s Shadow Clone technique, a move in which he creates multiple clones of himself. When a character uses the same move over and over and over and . . . well, things get bland and repetitive. Another detriment is that the sheer number of fights impedes the potency of plotting. Still, the combat stages are pretty intense and there are plenty of scenes for action fans to get pumped about.",10

                   Naruto is the best anime I've watched so far. There is a lot of action, comedy, and bit of romance and drama. This anime isn't only for amusement but it also has many sentimental lessons that can be learned. The art is amazing and so is the plot. I really recommend this anime for people to watch because to me it is a 11 out of 10. :)",10

                I have to say something about this anime. I didn't watched naruto as a child as most part of people that I know, I started recently searching for something on Netflix and stopped by then. All my friends watch anime and all of they called naruto uninteresting, but, as I was watching more and more, I was founding reasons and reasons to say why I love and I can say I think is one the best anime series for me until today.
First of all, Naruto is not the most handsome, cool, or interesting guy, he's extremelly normal, is just another one, and there are a
                  lot of characters stronger than him. He's a normal child that have a dream, and while the classic series goes on, we can see all his hardworking to be someone. Yes, I think this so incredible that I can't describe, we can see all the time he's struggling himself to get better and improve his abilities. We can say he's strong at heart too, such an inspiration all the time, following what he think it's the right thing to do, he's not like, I want to get more high so I have to follow the rules and be the best, no, he's just himself, someone that cares for anyone that passes his way, someone that just want to protect the persons that he love, someone that will fight even if he dies to protect his home . More, I can say that we can see so much that everyone is fighting against his own demons, Gaara, Neji, Lee, I like how developed are the characters all the time. Be an anime with so much episodes shows everyone's side, and I watched even the fillers, the only one I think it's terrible in the classic is the 192 episode, Ino Screams! Chubby Paradise!, this one I didn't even finished. 
I don't want to be critic about everything, just want to say that is a story that I enjoyed with my heart, and I'm happy for had started in 2018 even with the shippuden finished. I hope people can enjoy this story of a normal guy with a strong personality pursuing his dreams.
Ah, just for finish, I have to say that is an anime that shows that one person can change the world just being kind to another. Iruka sensei is the best character that changed naruto's world.
(sorry thebad english, I'm not fluent)",9
"
                Naruto.. I wasn't sure how to go about writing this since it's such a long series, so I figured the best way would to be write a little bit as I go and piece them together.
You immediately start off with Naruto Uzumaki, he's a cheeky kid, always causing trouble and when he's not, he's eating. 
Though you find out pretty quickly that there's a reason for it; he just wants to be cared for. Everybody has always looked down on him and judged him for reasons he didn't know. He always just figured it was because he was different, not because of something inside of
                   him. 
Finding out he has the love he's wanted from Iruka sensei, his point of view starts to change but so does everything else. 
From there he's placed in Team 7 with Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto has a massive crush on Sakura, Sakura loves Sasuke, and he doesn't really want anything to do with either of them.
Naruto comes to have a lot of respect for Kakashi sensei, like he does with Iruka and then Jiraiya. All 3 of them play a big part in his personal development. They all show him he's loved, which is something important to him. 
From the beginning it's a little slow, but it gets better. New characters start coming in, whether they're here with their own stories or to embellish on unfolding the plot, it depends on the person. Some stay and become prominent, others are just in and out very quickly. 
In all honesty, for a lot of it it wasn't really keeping my attention well, there'd be a couple of laughs or plot points that would catch my attention, but it would drop off quickly; Until Jiraiya. 
He's what saved the series for me, his character type and personality, but with him came the story getting deeper and lots of questions about how multiple different things will turn out. 
As with really long series, it takes a pretty long time for the story to get deep, this is no different. But once it does, it's decent. 
A lot of it is kids growing up, that might be why I wasn't enjoying it a whole lot until more adult humour came into it. But if kiddy characters and voices annoy you, this probably will too. They're kids, they're learning, so things that are obvious to the viewers aren't quickly discovered by them, there's childish arguments and irresponsibility. But they're kids. That's the point. This is showing them growing up, becoming better and learning about themselves and others. 
That's one thing about the fillers, I always watch them, but people who skipped them for this missed all the growth these kids go through. Becoming stronger mentally and physically, seeing it happen is one of the best parts, and makes the fillers worth it.
There are some definite feels parts, I got a little teary a couple of times. The Menma Memory Search mission arc was a big one. So be prepared for hidden emotional parts, because they pop up out of nowhere.
By the end I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, no it's not something I'm extremely impressed with but I'm happy I finished it. I enjoyed it, I'm glad I gave it a chance to prove that it's better than I assumed it would be, and I can see why so many people enjoy it.",7
"
                I grew up watching Naruto and it was my favorite show for a very long time. After a while, I stopped watching it but a few years back I decided to rewatch the entire series and I have to say, it is definitely one of the best Anime out there.
The story behind Naruto and lessons they show in the series are amazing.
The artwork is so nice, it seems so unique to me.
The music in this show is perfect. I always say that a soundtrack can make or break a series.
The Characters were perfect.
You get a lot of enjoyment from this show. The one problem I
                  had with it was ALL those fillers! But, I can let that slide:)
Overall, I would say this show will forever stay in the hearts of those who grew up with it.",10
"
                I haven't read the manga. Yes, I watched the dub. This review is episode 1 to episode 135. SPOILERS!
Naruto really isn't that amazing. It's story is overall decent with some great moments with decent characters but it doesn't matter because it's fun. The characters are fun even if they aren't that deep and their designs are great. Kakashi, Shikamaru, Guy, Lee, Temari, Jiraiya, Hiruzen, Tsunade, Neji, Hinata, Kiba, Shino are all good even if some of them don't get a lot of screen time.
Standout is Shikamaru my favorite, he's a genius with a unique way a fighting, he's lazy, he has great moments, his sexism
                  is a fun character quirk when all his fights are against girls and he just a cool guy who's actually one of the nicest. Tsunade is the perfect foul to Naruto, Naruto is an optimistic kid with a big dream while Tsunade is a bitter old lady who drinks and gambles who's lost the people important in her life. Sakura and Ino are the weak links but Sakura does improve.
The main villains are great. Orochimaru, Zabuza, Haku, Gaara, Kabuto, Itachi, Kisame,The Sound Ninja 4, Kimimaro, and eventually Sasuke are all great. There are some weaker minor villains but they serve their purpose. The music is amazing and they sound effects are nice. Openings 1-5 are all great. They're not Full Metal Alchemist level but they come close. 
The fights are great. Their long length will turn a lot of people off but they feel like real struggles with the two fighters in combat for hours and the show really sells the illusion of multiple fights occuring simultaneously. One major problem, the show really overuses flashbacks. Most of the time they're new information and they're interesting. They have good visuals and music but there are many that look visually boring or are information we've already scene and only pad out the run time.

                My favorite anime ever, a must-watch in my opinion
Main Characters -  Overall Rating  8.6/10
Naruto Uzumaki (Main protagonist) - 9.5/10.
Naruto as a character is really inspiring, showing that our enemies could become friends and that violence is never always a solution. The only reason why Naruto is not a 10/10 is that he is too forgiving towards the village for treating him like dirt. 
Sasuke Uchiha - Rating - 9/10.
Sasuke is a very interesting character. He is part of the famous Uchiha clan, which every single member except for him was killed by his older brother Itachi. Sasuke because of this is driven by
                  revenge and will do anything to avenge his clan. 
Sakura Haruno - Rating 6.5/10
I highly dislike Sakura. She takes every moment she can to belittle Naruto, and after obsesses over Sasuke. She tries harder at having Sasuke fall in love with her than actual training, which makes her extremely useless. She is a bitch in Naruto but gets a little better in Shippuden. But, sometimes she does something in Naruto which is why she is not lower
Kakashi Hatake - Rating 9.5/10.
Kakashi, the sensei to Naruto, Sasuke, and Uselessness (Sakura) is a very mysterious, but very interesting character who has been struck by tragedy his whole life. he is lazy, but very strong when serious, and provides comical relief when he is reading Icha Icha (porn books) and trying to stop Naruto and Sasuke from fighting
 Main Antagonists:
Overall Rating: 9.3/10
Haku: 9/10. Even though he was the antagonist of the Wave Arc, the first arc, he fought Naruto, injured Sasuke enough to where Naruto released some of the Kyuubi's power in rage. In the end, he turned good and after his death, helped Naruto to realize his ninja way.
Zabuza Momochi: 9.5. Zabuza during the Wave Arc appeared to be a ruthless shinobi who tried to kill Naruto and his companions so he can kill their client named Tazuna. Zabuza was shown to only see Haku as a tool to be used. He clashed against Naruto's ideals, and in the end, Naruto managed to help him realize how much Haku really meant to him, and after seeing Haku's body being disrespected by Gato, he attacked and killed him, but fell to his injuries and died laying beside Haku.
Kabuto Yakushi - 8/10. Orochimaru's right-hand man, who deceived Naruto's team in the Chunin Exam Arc and helped with the siege against Konoha. Pretty interesting, but at the time did not know much about him 
Gaara - 10/10. One of my favorite antagonists, he was the deranged jinchurikki of the One-Tails and seriously hurt Naruto's friends. He had one of the best battles in both Naruto and Naruto Shippuden against Rock Lee and after he was defeated by Naruto, changed his ways and started to become a caring person,
Orochimaru - 10/10. The main villain of Naruto (part one) that orchestrated the events leading to Sasuke's abandonment of the Leaf in search of the power that would defeat his brother Itachi, which lead Sasuke to him. He was behind the Invasion of the Leaf Village and was the cause of the Third Hokage's death. He wanted Sasuke so he could take his eyes, which would help him in his major goal, which is to master every jutsu the world has to offer. 
Supporting Characters - 8.5/10
Plot - 9.5/10
Fights - 9.5/10 
Best Fights:
(Rock Lee vs Gaara) - 10/10
(Naruto vs Sasuke) 10/10
Highly Recommend, it is really good,
One downside of Naruto is its filler episodes, so go to search up Naruto fillers and click on the AnimeFillerList one though. Although I do recommend watching the filler episode 'Gotta see, Gotta, know. Kakashi sensei's true face', it is a classic. (Or episode 101)",10

                                                                    Ah Naruto, one of the most popular anime ever. I am sure many people have seen it and have come here to see how others think about it, i will let you all know this is my first review. Many people think it is overhyped but i will let you all know i personally enjoyed this anime a lot. If you are worried about the number of episodes are too long or something then let me tell you the story will leave you wanting for more at the end of each episode. The entire series consists of comedy, emotional scenes which might teach viewers life lessons. Naruto teaching lessons may be an unpopular opinion.
The art and sound is exceptional as the series started in 2002. Talking about character development- I think it has been done really well as each and every character except a few of course has been given proper time to develop. So it's not like Naruto will be the favourite character as the story contains of great heroes and villains.
The entire story is like a rollercoaster with ups and downs, in some cases the characters might also relate to the characters connecting to their emotions and thoughts. The only negative part which me and others do not like about this show is that there are many filler episodes. Other than that i hope you all enjoy watching the show and feel free to refer to other reviews if you think i am being partial",9

                naruto in its self was a good anime it had a solid storyline and great character development but i had to draw the line when they started getting into the filler series. this review will be put into 2 parts 
Story and Character 
Part 1: story
ok well naruto starts off with a boy of the same name trying to become hokage ( you figure this out because he is saying this 500 times almost every sentence) and he does this by pulling pranks on the leaf village ( of course that will let you become there leader) after being caught he is tied up and
                  sent to NINJA SCHOOL! of course little ninjas need to go to school to and then fails the test to become a ninja. he is convinced to steal a sacred scroll from the hokage by one of his teachers Mizuki ( who only appears in this episode as a villain) after some fights naruto uses shadow clones to beat up mizuki to the brink of friking death he then is told by iruka he past and is now a ninja.
as i said before the story is solid but gets repetitive and stupid most of the time
character 
in naruto they like to explain characters backstory through flash backs ( such as narutos and gaaras life) or sakuras friendship with ino  this gives you alot to go on with a character so you know what they went through when they were children the only problem i have is ulmost every main character has been abused in some way as a child.
overal this anime gets an 8 for good storyline and good character developement",8
"
                Basically, Naruto's about a kid who desires to be the best. He undercover a lot of pain, and finally makes some friends when he graduates from the academy. 
Story: (7/10)
Not exactly the best story. There isn't much of a ""hook"", and it is only fairy enjoyable after the series is done introducing characters.
Art: (6/10)
Average art. Nothing else to really say.
Sound: (7/10)
There are some pretty good, suitable pieces of music for each scene. The problem however, is that they get TOO REPETITIVE after watching apparently 220 episodes... 
Character: (5/10)
Don't get me started on this. Very casual characteres - Almost no creativity in this.
Enjoyment: (9/10)
This partly reminds me of Dragon Ball Z, which always hyped me up. It's one of those shows for ""kids"". You gotta love fighting. The comedy is pretty good as well, if your sense of humor is along the way with this series.
Overall: (7/10)
It's not an incredible anime, nor is it such a bad anime, it's slightly above average in my opinion.",7
"
                Naruto is pretty famous anime and for the right reasons too.
The show has beautiful story.
It is fun to watch and the idea is unique too.The show does give some trouble in the beginning but believe me when I tell you this that it only gets better.
Naruto is good and helps you drive into the show pretty smoothly but Naruto Shippuden is on an whole other level.
It is so much better, not that Naruto is bad or anything.
Anime really lets you have feeling of entire journey.
From zero to hero.

                When this anime came out everyone was at static all my friends told me to watch this anime......and with all this hype how could I not get excited but while I continued to press on this show. Watching episodes......painfully getting through the god damn story arcs that were only occupying  show length I realized something.......IT WAS WASTING MY TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Don't get me wrong it was enjoyable........it just wouldn't stop with the fucking story arcs!!!!! And personally I felt betrayed....betrayed worst than when Bleach came out with Memories of Nobody damn that sucked for me.....
Its obvious to everyone the anime had potential....but the moment show continued
                  with it relentless fillers people couldn't take it any more. >_",6
"
                I love Naruto. The plot is almost perfect. The animations are great. The score perfectly underlines every emotion (it almost made me cry (Wind-Akeboshi)). The character development is awesome, they all have a backstory and you really feel with someone because the emotions are brought to you so well that you can understand their feelings. 
Now the negative side of it. It has an awful amount of Filler-Episodes and that really is annoying. While some are quite enjoyable, most of them are just boring. Also in the middle it can get a bit boring because of these episodes.
But in the end all I can say
                  is that you should give it a try because if you know what is a Filler and what isn't, you'll be able to skip all the boring episodes.
P.S. Just in case you don't know where to get a list of Filler-Episodes, here you go:

                I love this anime so much. From the world-building to the animation. Great characters, Great story, Great plot. The show most definitely had it's flaws, but it never ceased to amaze me with the story. The fights were beautiful and the second and fifth arc were possibly one of the best arcs in anime. I wish I could go into greater detail on why this was so good, but I would have to spoil the show for newcomers that want to check out Naruto. To all the newcomers, Watch this show, Period. The bar set by this franchise was so high, I have yet to
                  see a show other than FMA, AOT, OP, Bleach and HXH come even CLOSE to how good this anime was and this was in 2002. I wasn't even born yet! Anyways,The fanboy has to leave now.",9
"
                Before I watched Naruto, I thought it would be a goofy, thoughtless kids' show that people only liked because of memes and nostalgia. Man was I wrong. The amount of thought and love put into the story, characters, and messages is astounding. I would recommend Naruto to everyone who is interested in anime, although there are a couple issues that I have with it. One of the issues with the anime is the filler. Oh boy, is there filler. In fact, if I remember correctly, I think that there's at least one season that's just entirely filler. I had to look up which episodes were
                  filler so that I could skip them, because most of the filler in Naruto isn't very good, although there are a few exceptions. Not to mention, the pacing is really, really slow. Another issue I have is with the romance and representation of female characters in this show. Many of the female characters are associated with romance, which wouldn't be a bad thing if the romance was written well. However, romance isn't the strong suit of this story, which makes many of the female characters feel weak in character. The main exceptions to this, in my opinion, are Lady Tsunade and Hinata (although I feel that Hinata should have had a bit more screen time to develop as a character). However, I rated this anime a 10 despite its shortcomings, because for me its strengths make up for where it falls short. I'm a sucker for well done character development, and Naruto is a master of characters, themes, and fights. The fights really feel like more than just attacks. They almost feel like extensions of the characters and what they stand for. I don't want to get into spoilers, but there are multiple fight scenes that accompany backstory, and as the backstory becomes more developed, the fight grows more interesting and thematically complex along with it. It's really amazing. There's a lot of other stuff I could talk about, but I want to keep this review free of major spoilers, and I don't want to make it too long either. I'll finish by saying that although Naruto isn't perfect, it resonated with me and stayed in my heart so well that I can't help but give it a 10. I understand that for some the show's flaws may ruin the experience, and I also understand that this review may seem too subjective. But, Naruto hit my heart, and it feels like a part of me now. In my opinion, I think that's what an anime should be. But, if you hate bad pacing, maybe reading the manga might be your preference.",10

                People seem to dickride this show in recent reviews so lets talk about it.
WARNING, this review will almost definitely contain spoilers.
Im not covering the whole show, just the 220 episodes of the naruto, which means i'll be excluding shippuden.
So naruto starts of the series by basically being an asshole bratty kid and basically says to everyone, ""you cant do the things i do, im the main character, im better than you""
The show always tries to preach to you and emphasize the lesson that even if you aren't born with amazing gifts, hardwork can always make up for it. Let's mainly focus and talk about the
                  Neji vs Naruto fight during the chunin exams. Lets first establish the two characters, Neji and Naruto are mirrors in this instance. First lets talk about naruto, but which naruto? There's a lot of fuckin naruto's in this series. Obito is a naruto, Jiraiya is a naruto, Tsunade's stupid little brother is a naruto, Tsunade's supposed boyfriend is a naruto, Kiba's a naruto, Hashirama is a naruto, Sai's brother is a naruto... It seems like EVERYONE at this point is a naruto, TOO many naruto's. But lets talk about my most favourite naruto of them all, no its not naruto, its Iruka Sensei, the most useless and unimportant character in the series. This guy made a big deal about caring for naruto at the start of the series when everyone hates him because they're so similar, his parents died when this big fox that lives in naruto's anus, or spinal cord, i dont really know where. But this fox ate their house or something and munched on his parents, damn that's quite rough buddy. So Iruka Sensei grew up without parents and he also was stupid. So to get attention he acted like an idiot, when really he actually is. So he's like, hey naruto *while crying*, you also are an idiot and your parents are dead like mine, so i'll teach you how to fail and be useless in the ninja world life like me, and he really did try to do that. Unfortunately for him though, naruto ends up becoming a living god that fights a living god that basically gave birth and created the whole shinobi/human race in naruto. He fought a tree from the moon with an eye with 10 tails or something, idc. But what's Iruka sensei doing by the end of the series? Nothing, just jerking it, no wife, no nothing, no advancements in his career as a teacher or a ninja either. He's just busting nuts against the wall until he dies alone in minimum wage. Why? because unlike naruto who is ACTUALLY VERY TALENTED and has a lot of shit going for him that this guy(iruka) will NEVER have. This guy is naruto if naruto wasn't a talented hypocrite who yells hardwork all the time when really he never worked hard at all.
The series makes a big deal at showing how talented and privileged naruto really is. They bestow upon him and spoon feed him on a silver platter many gifts. The first of them is 9 tails from sonic that lives in his ball sack or something. Since its a japanese anime they have something called chakra which they act like its physical stamina but really its not and its just magic points that allows you to do magic tricks that you can kill people with and cause big magic explosions without having to make am actual bomb or something. So, tails the big red fox has ALOT of magic points, LIKE ALOT and when Naruto runs out of magic when he does stupid and pointless shit during the so called tactical fights which he usually does tails the big red fox do will give him more! How much more? just however much the plot needs. Heck at this point its like pokemon when the animal wins the match for the trainer and everyone is like ""WOW, tHAT tRaINEr sUrE iS sTRoNg!"" even though the trainer didn't do anything. This anime does just that with naruto's fox thats up his anus with magic powers called chakra. Naruto does something stupid and then the fox bails him out and everyone all around naruto is like ""Wow naruto sure is strong and is really good at becoming a magical ninja now, i better believe it!"" Let me give you one example. Our hero naruto is tricked into stealing some secret high level scroll from the secret ninja association library book scroll place and learns the signature move to make shadow clones. Naruto learns to do this and immediately makes 100+ clones after reading the scroll for JUST a few minutes! Are you kidding me?! This is stupid because later on we find out that being able to make just a few of these requires a ton of chakra points. So how did naruto make so many? Fox hax! Shadow clones are apparently some secret technique/magic trick invented by the 2nd hokage and since it was on a forbidden top secret scroll it apparently is some high level technique taught to high level ninja aka Jonin although even kids recognize shadow clones when they see them and other villagers also recognize it when they see it and enemies all over the ninja world ALSO recognize shadow clones to be some kind of mundane trick so i guess its not that secret..? The point is naruto can only do it cuz he's cheating with his talent and fox hax. He later on even gets told that he's garbage at doing it because compared to his teammates, his magic point control is too weak and he wastes too much of it everytime he performs the jutsu/magic spell trick thingy. He's just dumping a bunch of magic points into the trick until it works. Ironically enough, at the start of the series they show that naruto himself doesn't even know what chakra IS??!! He's not only stupid and a cheat, but he also doesn't work hard and never studies. The thing that pisses me off about naruto is that he always repeats and says that he always tries really hard but in reality we never actually see him try or work hard to become a good ninja. Anyways i think im done writing this review, you kind of get the point. Dont watch this anime its a waste of time. Definitely not the worst thing ever, but could be way better.",3

                NOTE: I will be updating and trying to build the best possible review that anyone can read. 
Me personally i have to say that naruto is a good anime, because it can bring so many people into the world of anime, and being a well know anime can bring everything, and all opinions alike which is good for discussion.  
 As a kid watching naruto i was so entertained, and would always wake up the next week to see the new episode. Hearing the music while watching made the experience unique for me, and hearing the classic OST makes my body tingle, and feel
                  a sense of nostalgia, while remembering the parts in which the music was played.  Of course my opinion of the series is not cloudy because it's the number one in my heart. There are plot holes, the way characters were written, and used could have been far better. And fillers which destroy the show for anyone who can't handle them, However i love anything that has to do with the naruto universe, so i will, and have watched everything naruto related.",8
"
                Naruto (and Shippuden) is one of my favourite creations, not just within anime but in media overall. This is in spite of a few flaws, which I will outline along with its' strongest elements.
The story is a well-paced, exciting, and focused adventure. Naruto sets out his goal from episode 1, and never strays, though he has much to learn. By episode 4, the friendship, intrigue and rivalry that will be of overarching importance right till the very end is well established. One possible exception to this is episode 2, which focuses on a character who is fairly minor, but in my opinion, really annoying. But
                  again, he's a minor character, so it's a small gripe.
Though the anime follows perilous fights and tragic characters, it has many light-hearted scenes and downright goofy moments that give it a grounding as an optimistic show. It has minimal fanservice. It doesn't fall into the 'monster of the week' format (at least the non-filler episodes) nor is it bound by being seasonal - it takes exactly as much time as it needs for each arc, and gives good build up for the introduction of new major characters, including truly mysterious and intimidating villains.
Speaking of which, here lies Naruto's greatest strength: a compelling cast of fleshed out characters. Like many shounen stories, Naruto has a large cast, but it never feels TOO big. This is down to smart and memorable character design, and the time spent getting to know each one through a mixture of battles and flashbacks. This creates a wealth of characters with varied motivations worth rooting for.
While Naruto himself certainly annoys the people around him, he avoids annoying the viewer. His sympathetic background, the motivation for his behaviour, and his optimistic, good-hearted nature make him an endearing protagonist that you can believe in.
Naruto's perfect foil, Sasuke, while certainly part of an 'edgy boy' trope that you either love or hate, is every bit as compelling. His overarching backstory and development is central to the series, and one of the most enjoyable elements.
To accompany the action is some great music. Toshiro Masuda's score blends traditional Japanese elements with invigorating battle music, giving a unique and memorable tone. This mirrors the setting of the series, which draws on old Japanese folklore and modern fantastical elements. Overall it is an OST that I have kept in rotation for over 10 years. There are some suitably badass opening songs (Re:member and Yura Yura are my own favourites), and sweet melancholic ending songs (the very first ending, Wind, remains the most memorable across this and Shippuden).
Personally, I've always watched the English dub, and I find it perfectly satisfying. I've watched odd episodes and compilations with the Japanese audio and that seems good too; I haven't detected any big shift in tone from one to the other.
The art is pleasant and fair quality throughout, with an obvious focus on fast-paced fighting animations. While there are many fantastical battle elements that are exciting to watch, some of the best moments are in more simple, hand-to-hand combat, where the brutality of each move is felt (a particularly good example of this is in episode 85). The show also doesn't hold back from goofy, cartoon-ish frames to accompany light-hearted moments. The palette remains vibrant throughout, which I'm sure helps it appeal to younger viewers, but is not so garish as to put off older viewers.
Now, one big potential drawback of Naruto is a heavy volume of filler episodes, even by the standards of its' peers. Fortunately, this series is laid out so that the vast bulk of filler comes in the last 84 episodes, meaning the first 136 are all pretty much essential viewing and advance the story. After getting that far into the series, you're well able to decide whether to watch some of these episodes or to skip ahead to Shippuden - most of the filler is enjoyable, if not all that memorable.
Another element that has been the subject of plenty of gentle fun-poking over the years is how many battles are drawn out over multiple episodes, with excessive recaps thrown in. This, combined with the use of flashbacks during battle sequences, can slow the overall pace down quite a bit.
This is a legitimate criticism, but not one that spoils the show, for me at least. For viewers wanting fast, shorter battles, and a quick resolution to the story, this may be too frustrating to get past. However, this happens because Naruto isn't a 'monster of the week' kind of show (I guess it would be 'mission of the week' in any case); each enemy is treated as interesting and important - even the earliest opponents Naruto's team faces are remembered by the characters and still influence them all the way down the line in Shippuden.
Overall, I enjoy Naruto more than any other anime series. It was the first shounen series that I watched, but I have still not found another to top it. While at first I was intimidated by the sheer volume of episodes to get through, by the time I first finished the whole series I actually found myself immediately rewatching all the story episodes again before moving on to Shippuden! It remains a heartening, life-affirming story that I continue to dabble in, and one which I will revisit throughout my life.
For viewers looking for a gritty, or cynical anime, this won't satisfy you. Naruto is relentless in his will to never give up on himself or his friends, which is the central joy of the show. If you're a fan of the genre then it is surely worth your time. As an introduction to shounen anime I think it is also a worthy series; a simple premise and lovable characters will let you know within a few short episodes whether or not it is for you.",10
"
                The guys evaluate the fillers hahahaha
Plot:
Perfect, everything is perfectly fitted, the universe that Naruto is incredible, a pity that was destroyed in the shippuden, but well, as I said, the universe of naruto is very alive, detailed, and complex, different from the shippuden, as an exception they are not just ""who is stronger than who"" as they are incorporated from ninjas, strategy and planning, not to mention that all arcs are captivating, fun, exciting, and sad, if it were a first-hand anime I would have cried a lot (so much that I almost cried in x parts) but as I already knew about important events,
                  I managed to prepare myself kkkk. but for those who have not seen the anime, jesus, it is a full plate, detail; as I already know the story re-watching the anime, you can see that the author leaves little details and loose ends that are revealed later, WHAT IS VERY AMAZING, man the level of quality of the naruto plot is very high, agr more one thing, there are a lot of people who complain about flashbacks, but why? ok right on shippuden has useless mt flashback, but here in the classic, the flashbacks are CRUCIAL for the story to work, not only the story, but for the characters to work, if there were no lee flashbacks how would we know all his motivation ? people complain about flashbacks because they already know the characters' past, but what about those who have never seen the anime, and don't know anything? (which is rare in 2020 BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS EXCEPTIONS) so, flashbacks are crucial, and another if you already know about the past, just skip that, that's what I did, but well, you can see that the story of naruto has aged well, the story is excellent!
Soundtrack:
Another incredible thing about Naruto, is a soundtrack, all the incredible moments that they have in Naruto, are only amazing thanks to the soundtrack, it is perfect, and always appears at the right time, there is no ost that is bad in Naruto, either for comedy moment, action, terror, sadness, climax, it's another level, naruto has an extremely striking soundtrack, something that I only saw in, boku no hero, titan attack, death note and other POOR QUIET ANIMES, without doubts, naruto is an example of anime with a striking soundtrack.
Characters:
One more hit, all the characters are excellent if not perfect, each better than the other, shikamaru with his epic modifications that use a strategy that reveals you are ""OWWWW SHIT MEN"", Rock Lee with his fluid fights and exciting, Neji with the trigram stop there, not to mention that everyone has a great construction, Sakura ent mds, she has those amazing eps of her in the forest of death, where she matures in a magnificent way, and of course, a too bad the shippuden took all of that, and threw it in the trash ... but it's life.
Animation:
Good, although not very consistent, it is fluid, which is important for the fights, I think it is very smart, maintain consistency to tell and develop the story, or decrease consistency and increase fluids, to make the rules, these techniques are used at times x in history, which is very smart, for sure, nothing to complain about.
Agr I wanted to give a light comment about the arches of the naruto:
Land of waves: A great arc, to present, and expand the universe of naruto, brings great reflections, and great fights.
Chunnin 'proofs: The best arc, it presents countless new characters, remarkable modifications, the main characters evolves and others that just appeared, if to say that it is the most important arc of the whole anime.
The 3 legendary Sanins: Great bow too, Rasengan's training is fun to follow, and that battle of Sanins quick, good d +
Lastly;
The rescue mission: It is the weakest, but it is still good, as appropriate captivate, and they are all good (the choji one is a bit of a joke) but well, it is interesting.
Fun:
Guaranteed, Naruto was and still is a great anime, if watched in the right way, the fillers really degrade the anime, then dps from ep 136 can now go to shippuden, then when the pain saga is over it can stop, because the anime really bad, WELL BAD
Conclusion:
Yeah, classic Naruto is excellent, and the best shounen anime that has ... dps of fullmetal, a shame that the shippuden spoiled this whole beautiful story and threw it in the trash, but well, with that my note for classic Naruto is:
9 Datebayo and 1 bowl of Ramén (9 \ 10) critically speaking, for the anime to have all fillers, and to finish open it should receive a 9, but in moral, fds the fillers.
Pros: Everything
Cons: Fillers",9
"
                I was a 11 years old who started watching Naruto on TV, but the Brazilian dub stopped on the Chunin Exam arc for a long time. With that in mind, I stopped watching it.
In 2020, almost 23 years old, I decided to watch Naruto, from beginning to end (obviously jumping the fillers) and oh boy, I watched the original Naruto series in 2 months.
What a great anime! I love the characters, specially Kakashi, Jiraiya, Itachi and Tsunade. The lore inside Naruto is pretty interesting, and Naruto's journey was so fun to watch. Sasuke's journey to the dark side is one of the highest points in
                  the series by the way.
Right now, I'm halfway through Naruto Shippuden, so it will take some months before I give my note for that series. Watch Naruto, it's really fun!",9
"
                    This is my first review so lets get this started..... Naruto..... A good ass anime, for the people who don't have taste in this anime or say this anime is trash only loves the anime's with overpowered anime emo boys with busty girls crawling all over him, anyways. 
    The story: a solid 5 strait filler besides from the Sasuke retrieval ark the best ark in the anime. 
    The Art: A 5 if you didn't watch Naruto Shonen Jump in 2012 you thought this was the best art in the world! The art did
                  have its flaws. 
    The Sound: Solid 4 while watching the anime in dub, with some characters just listening was strait torture to my ears.
    characters: An 8 amazing characters, for example, Rock Lee a character born without jutsu spends his life striving for the best of the best only using tijutsu. Another character is Kakashi hes a chill character and he has a good design. One of favorite characters is Zabuza even though he is dead great character.
    enjoyment: Solid 8 have you seen the fights..... Good ass choreograph! good ass fights! But the plot is trash i guess.
    Overall: Solid 9 The fights are to be praised don't believe me take a look on YouTube, the story.... nah i guess its good. good Sasuke retrieval ark how could you not love this anime. bruh I am telling you if you don't love this anime with good fights you must only like the anime's like non-action or slice of life or other lame shit like that.",9
"
Some Spoilers Ensue:
I've finally finished! Wow, what a ride this was! I absolutely loved this show and I'm so excited to start Shippuden! I love Shounen anime and this one was up there with the best of them. It consisted of about 130 or so canon episodes, and 90 or so filler episodes. The canon episodes were amazing and the filler were...well, filler. Going into the show, I found myself not loving the first 20 or so episodes, but once we got to the arc dealing with Haku and Zabuza, I became hooked. What really set the show off thought was when we started the
                  exams. Oh my fuck I was watching like 12 eps a day and I couldn't get enough. The fighting was epic. I loved finding out about all the different jutsu specific to each character. There seems to be a divide in the fandom on Sasuke, but I loved him. I felt his pain and I loved his development.
Story:
The overlying arc of this show lies with the development of its characters. 3 ninja with different goals are growing up and learning their crafts. They go on missions along the way and each have a bit of story surrounding them. Naruto holds the spirit of a fox demon in him that was sealed by the hokage. His overall goal throughout the show is to become hokage which I hope plays out in Shippuden. Sasuke is on the path to revenge after his parents were brutally murdered when he was little. His story is one of the most thrilling. Sakura...well she wasn't my favorite. Most of the time she was either pining over Sasuke or being a burden during fights. She only slightly got better after she decided to become a medical ninja. Of course, what starts out as only 3 character arcs quickly becomes many more as we enter the Chunin exams and get a slew of new and interesting characters. From there, the show really spreads its wings and shows you why it is one of the most popular anime of all time.
Animation:
It was very hit and miss for me. Some of it was good (I.e. the Naruto vs. Sasuke fight), and some of it was below average. I'm hoping that it gets better with Shippuden because this was probably my worst critique for this show.
Sound:
The show shines here. Almost every OP and ED theme are catchy and good. I especially loved CHABA's ""Parade"" and FLOW's ""Remember"" among others. The OST music is really good too if a bit overplayed. The voice acting was also above par for the most part. During the filler, I could pick out some lacking VAs, but during the canon show, it was solid.
Characters:
Another reason why I adore this show is the characters. I have so many favorites I can't even decide who I like the most. Everyone was fledged out and everyone got their moment to shine. Some huge standouts were Gaara, Shikamaru, Kiba, Neji, Hinata, Kakashi, Jiraiya, everyone. They were so fulfilling to watch and they had their own ways of doing things and their own obstacles to overcome which made the show all the more interesting to watch.
A Note About The Filler:
The good thing about Naruto is that there was hardly ANY filler in the first half of the show. They shoved it all in at the end which is both good and bad. For one, it lets the whole show flow the way its supposed to and makes for a super interesting watch. For two (if you're a completionist like me), it makes for a tedious last half. There are only 2 filler eps and one arc during the canon episodes. I can't say I hated the filler, but I could have done without it for sure. Some standout filler were:
1. EP101 - Gotta See! Gotta Know! which is the infamous Kakashi face reveal. It is funny and definitely worth a watch.
2. EPS136-141 - Land Of Rice Fields Arc where we still get some Orochimaru and some cool stuff with Jiraiya.
3. EP168 - The Ramen episode which is so bad its good.
4. EP177 - The one with Jiraiya's book and the mailmen...it's great.
5. EPS197-201 - Trap Master Arc because I thought it was cool to see a lot of my favorites working together after so much time in just groups of 3.
6. EPS213-215 - The Menma Arc because feels.
Overall:
The show itself is super addicting. I loved the exams, the battle between Orochimaru and the Third Hokage, and of course, the entirety of EPS 101-135. The battle between Naruto and Sasuke is up there with some of the best anime battles I've seen yet. It was as epic as it could get and I just loved every second. Haters can hate, but there's a reason why this show is so popular.
Watched Dubbed.",8

                Naruto is a series that fallows a little Genin named Naruto (no surprise there). It is a very high rating animated story (I believe it's right up there as number 1, or at least in the top 3). Why might that be? Perhaps it's because of how great and promising the idea seems to those who don't watch the entire thing. I've seen every last episode, and I can still say that I understand why it has such a high rating. 
To put it simply: there are over 200 episodes, which can seem pretty daunting. I know I don't like anime that will take up
                  a whole lot of my time. Obviously, there were going to be fillers since it would take a lot more master-work to make 220x24 minutes of pure base-plot. Now, I'm not saying this is a horrid series, I'm just saying that at times I just wanted to skip forward but couldn't (as it's in my nature to watch everything so I can see if they're foreshadowing an event in the near or distant future). 
Story: Naruto was basically the first anime that I was consciously aware of as being an anime. I watched it as a dub at first when it showed up on Disney XD, then continued on to watch it subbed so I could watch more of it with cool accents and fast words (it helps your reading rate). The driving point of the story didn't deter me because I thought it was childish. In fact, because of Naruto's dream, and the way he wanted to grow up, and all the friends that he wanted to make, I grew to love the series. But that doesn't mean that it earned a great mark. (6/10 - Fair)
Art: The artwork was beautiful. At first, it seemed a bit jerky with the movements, but over time you could see as it improved. The character drawings in themselves were masterpieces with their facial expressions and the way the animators seemed to know just where to put a windy element and whatnot. Even the fighting scenes were realistic, with their skins seeming to stretch out in slow motion as they were punched. (9/10 - Great)
Sound: The OP's and ED's, especially the OST's, were truly amazing. They set me in a fighting or a sad mood, then made me feel happy again and hope as the characters faced off the enemy that they absolutely had to beat. I wish I could download the songs and just listen to them over and over again while staring out into the rain... but I have school to attend. (9/10 - Great)
Character: The characters were cliche, and I found myself hating some of the main characters. One of the things that I hated most was getting this 3-episode long flashback of one character. I realize that it's good for gathering more information on someone, but there are some characters that are just too minor or just don't need such a lengthy flashback. Honestly, sometimes it felt like it was being dragged out just to make more episodes. There are some instances that I liked watching them, and then there were some where they repeated a flashback from way-back-when over and over again. Of course, Naruto is one of these cliche characters. Now, don't get me wrong, this is why I loved him and the series. Naruto was a boy that wanted to save others without becoming a monster. He used most opportunities to sound profound and look like a hero. If I hadn't seen his past, I would have hated him and wondered what gave him the right to talk like that. But I know that he had every right because I knew him, and I knew who he was going to be. (5/10 - Mediocre)
Enjoyment: I cant' say I didn't enjoy watching this series (though I can say I wouldn't have enough time to watch it again). It was my first anime, and I loved it. I still love it. That would make the rating I gave it seem kind of confusing, but it's like one of those little brothers/sisters that you don't like but love anyways. The characters took me places with their determination and the soundtracks let me ride their waves to the right moods. The ending left me feeling hollow until I picked up the sequel. But it did not completely measure up. (6/10 - Fair)
So, overall, this was a 6/10 anime, which means it was fair enough. I would recommend it to anyone just because I know that it's a great series to watch. When I rate it, I look at all the 220 episodes combined. Had it been shorter (perhaps 50 or something since I can't think of packing all of it into a simple 20 episode-series) I would have rated higher since there wouldn't have been as much to go over.",6

                It's my first time review so go easy on me and I don't want to drag this review long,after all we are talking about Naruto here Most Popular Shonen anime :XD
NARUTO a typical shonen Anime with lots of fight,drama and comedy,i only watched till episode 135 that is where original storyline ends,And few filler arcs worth totally 20 episodes.
There is nothing to say more about Naruto,it's already pretty popular and same as all other shonen animes,some times it drags a little like in ""sasuke recovery mission arc"" ""konoha crush arc"" but it's shonen anime after all, what can you expect?
Art quality are not that great
                  either but sound is quite good,as for the storyline and characters that is what motivates me to watch this series.
If you are fan of action and long running anime then it's for you.
I'm not Good At writing reviews so I end it here and sorry for my bad English too, thanks for reading :D
Here I come Shippuden ;)",8
"
                I may be biased here but hey, Naruto is the one who brought me to anime world (well it's Sasuke actually) without Naruto I'd still be blind about anime world. Naruto is the only one anime that I gave 10 because ofc:
1. I'm biased.
2. There's sasuke.
3. Sasusaku is one of the top OTP.
4. the character drawings, the background stories, everything is great. IDK what to say anymore about that.
5. teach us many lessons (and great quotes as well)
6. great music.
7. many twists and many more things that I can't mention but it's really worth to watch!

"
                Please don't mind my cracky english, please don't cringe.
At first I thought writing a review under such a ""huge"" fanbased anime, my review will get lost, but never the less I think Naruto does deserve my opinion.
Let me talk about me first. When I was a kid and Naruto was on TV I never was excited about, no- I hated it (maybe because of the disgusting german/english version of the first opening).
But as the year passed by me and my sister watched it and give it a try but I can't really remember anything (I kinda knew, what the story was about but I mainly
                  remember shippuden).
After Shippuden end and Boruto is crap, Netflix and me decided to bring Naruto back to life (yay).
So let me get the facts straight: I have watched Naruto classic with all the fillers once, I just can't remember some episodes in detail.
I rewatched the first episodes of Naruto in this week, so my head is kinda fresh.
Art:
Naruto has his individually style you can't find it elsewhere- it musn't be the perfect masterpiece anime, it can be trash! But if the trash has an individuallity in his character design, I will be pleased. Among all the animes I watched, anime with great story etc, if they look like any other anime, I get bored. So standing ovation for Naruto.
Of course you need to have in mind, that Naruto is an old anime. The quality isn't HD, but you get a nostalgic feeling from it. 
Sound:
There are some soundtracks, that are really funny but annyoing at the same time but the openings and endings are sometimes real gold. You never get tired of opening 1, although it might be trash, never you will get bored of opening 2, 3- AH who am I kiding? All the openings are wonderful, my personal favourite of all time: 5. To much feelings in the heighest climax point of Naruto.
Story:
I will not include those fillers. There are plenty of sites which list all the filler episodes, so don't watch them! 
The Story follows a main goal from the very beginning.
We all know, that our beloved brat Naruto wants to become the best ninja of all time and he wants to be acknowledge by the people, who hated him the whole time. This is basically how it starts, but it is dark from the very beginning- a child abandoned from all people in the village but never he shows his tears to everyone but change it into hard work. 
Altough Naruto started the lonley boy cliche(but hey, he started it first).
But the story will follow a second main goal, which gets more into the center while being in the climax of the show (not going into detail).
What makes the show great:
You will notice, that every character which there is, shape the whole plot.
This is something, that not every author manage to do- to create a whole world based of his characters and their actions.
I compared Game of Thrones with Naruto. 
Everyone was hyped by the complicated story just based by a lot of characters and I looked at them thinking they could have watched Naruto and they would like it, but they don't watch it because it is a ""cartoon"".
But lets go back to my comparison:
Naruto did it first. I watched some other great shounen too, eg One Piece which is also very great, but only Naruto anime has a connecting with all characters within the show without loosing the connecting. You will see that you never wonder where character xy might be right know, because they exist in your mind already. It is so deep, that you understand every single step they make, the sadnees they feel, the anger that they keep in.
What was annyoing?:
1)Based on Story and Character alone would made it a 10, but regardless I have skipped the fillers or not, they exist. Fillers are always bad and always annyoing. It is better to wait for a new episode than to see some unnecassary content.
2)Flashbacks. Every time there is a emotional deep fight or conversation there are flashbacks. It is a common cliche which is cringy.
Overall:
Those two points are points, that ruined a great show, but I couldn't find the sectore in which I could have prove my score at the end.
Story 10
Art 9 
Sound 9
Characters are 10
Enjoyment? 5, I want to give less but it seems unfair because 
I am rewatching it, so how I am not enjoying?
Overall I cant give a 10, but 8 seems maybe to good for this anime.
Again, I think Naruto is a great anime which I loved the most. But it is annoying to.",8

                despite i admit that naruto isn't the best anime ever, it's my favorite. I found the story really catchy, until the end of the Pain saga. But we are talking about the pre-timeskip. I think that the best thing about naruto is secondary characters having a strong influence on the story. Villains are incredibly well-written, and Itachi remains one of the best-written characters in manga history. In the pre-timeskip, there are no bad sagas at all: the Zabuza one was very good to introduce main characters, the chunin exam is fucking amazing, the tsunade rescue arc is very good and funny, and the sound village
                  guys were freaking awesome.",10

                Essa review contém spoilers. This review contains spoilers.
Para começar eu vou falar de aspectos conceituais e potenciais jogados fora que correspondem à maior parte desse anime.
O anime é composto por contradições e quebra de conceitos construídos no mundo ficcional onde se passa a própria história. Vemos classes de ninjas que indicam o nível de habilidade (genins, jounins, etc.), mas que frequentemente não são relevantes porque não fazem diferença e personagens que tem potencial e títulos, mas que são uma coisa totalmente diferente disso sendo jogados fora depois. Alguns exemplos:
No arco que Sasuke sai de Konoha, uma equipe de jounins aparece sendo surrada por inimigos que
                  perderam para uma equipe de genins e um recém chunin.
Sakura tem muito potencial e está a altura de Sasuke e Naruto, mas é simplesmente deixada de lado a história inteira servindo apenas para que a equipe 7 tenha o número correto de membros. A luta que ela teve contra a Ino foi apenas uma coincidência forçada e foi totalmente motivada por conta do conflito que elas tem por gostar do Sasuke. O empate foi o que fez a luta ser ainda pior.
Rock Lee tem muito potencial, mas, depois da luta Lee versus Gaara, ele foi ficando cada vez mais desdenhado por Kishimoto.
Kakashi, o ninja que copia, usa uma fração ínfima dos jutsus que ele copiou desmerecendo o título dado.
O Sharingan, os Clones das Sombras e o Rasengan são alguns dos golpes mais desperdiçados que existem. Começam sendo conceituados como golpes ótimos, mas que são usados sem estratégia nenhuma durante a maior parte do tempo. Os clones servem só para intimidar e mostrar a quantidade de chakra que o indivíduo pode usar, nada mais.
Furos de roteiro.
Ao observar o papel dos personagens próximos de Naruto, percebe-se que praticamente todos eles poderiam criar uma relação melhor criando papeis mais específicos. A Kyubi selada em Naruto certamente melhoraria a relação que ele tem com a aldeia visto que o seu poder indica poder militar, mas foi praticamente deixado pelos seus conhecidos responsáveis como uJiraya ou o Terceiro Hokage.
Fillers desnecessários de mais.
O único filler que presta de Naruto é o episódio 101 (sobre a máscara do Kakashi). O restante simplesmente serve para prolongar ainda mais a história e desenvolvendo pouco os personagens.
A invasão à casa de Orochimaru é um dos fillers mais sem noção que existem. Sabendo que ele é um dos Sannin, uma equipe de genins não deveria entrar na sua casa tão facilmente e conseguir causar algum estrago.
Animação ruim.
É evidente que a animação é ruim. Você pode ver desenhos desproporcionais e animações de árvores que parecem feitas por crianças de dois anos o anime inteiro. As animações de abertura e término dos episódios são genéricas de mais, como colocar personagens principais correndo, usando poderes e fazendo poses ""legais"" e mesmo assim conseguem ser consideradas boas pelo fanboys como boas.
Flashbacks.
Quando usados no momento correto causam o efeito correto, mas praticamente todos os flashbacks são desnecessários. Tão desnecessários que eu poderia considerar uma espécie de filler (enchimento) apenas para fazer os episódios durarem mais. Retirando os fillers e flashbacks, Naruto poderia ser resumido em pouquíssimos episódios úteis.
Trilha sonora repetitiva.
Você pode prever exatamente onde cada música será usada porque temos apenas uma música para cada clima. Por isso começam a ficar repetitivas e genéricas.
A base de fãs.
Isso poderá irritar muita gente, com certeza. Como dito algumas vezes, fanboys de Naruto idolatram o anime porque provavelmente é o anime mais popular e porque deve ser o primeiro anime que viram. O anime tem muitos pontos negativos que são encobertos pelos fãs fiéis que parecem estar em todos os lugares, ficando irritados por quem mostra onde a história é ruim.
Concluindo, Naruto é o pior anime que já vi e que só consegue ter a nota que tem no My Anime List por causa do grande número de fanboys que idolatram o anime. Kishimoto fez um péssimo trabalho em criar um mundo e desconstruir os conceitos dele logo depois.
Tenho dúvida se assisto o Shippuden apenas para saber o que acontece nessa parte, mas com certeza irei com uma espectativa muito baixa.
_________________________________
Translation:
To begin with I am going to talk about conceptual and potential aspects thrown away that correspond to most of this anime.
The anime is composed of contradictions and breaking of concepts built in the fictional world where the story itself takes place.  We see classes of ninjas that indicate skill level (genins, jounins, etc.), but often not relevant because they make no difference and characters that have potential and titles, but are a totally different thing from being thrown away later.  Some examples:
In the bow Sasuke leaves Konoha, a team of jounins appears to be beaten by enemies that have been lost to a genin team and a newly chunin.
Sakura has a lot of potential and is up to Sasuke and Naruto, but is simply left out of the whole story serving only so that Team 7 has the correct number of members. The fight she had against Ino was just a forced coincidence and was totally motivated by the conflict they have over liking Sasuke. The draw was what made the fight even worse.
Rock Lee has a lot of potential, but after the Lee versus Gaara fight, he became increasingly disdained by Kishimoto.
 Kakashi, the copying ninja, uses a tiny fraction of the jutsus that he copied, disregarding the given title.
 Sharingan, Shadow Clones and Rasengan are some of the most wasted blows there are. They start out as being conceptualized as great scams, but they are used without any strategy most of the time. Clones are only meant to intimidate and show how much chakra an individual can use, nothing more.
Script holes.
Looking at the role of the characters close to Naruto, one realizes that virtually all of them could create a better relationship by creating more specific roles. The Kyubi sealed in Naruto would certainly improve his relationship with the village as his power indicates military power, but it was practically left by his well-known leaders like Jiraya or the Third Hokage.
No more unnecessary fillers.
Naruto's only filler is episode 101 (about Kakashi's mask). The rest simply serves to further lengthen the story and little development of the characters.
The invasion of Orochimaru's house is one of the most clueless fillers in existence. Knowing he is one of the Sannin, a team of genins should not come into your house so easily and be able to wreak havoc.
Bad animation.
Clearly the animation is bad. You can see oversized designs and tree animations that look like two year olds make the entire anime. The opening and ending animations of the episodes are too generic, like getting main characters running, using powers and doing ""cool"" poses and yet they can still be considered good by the fanboys as good.
Flashbacks
When used at the right time they have the right effect, but virtually all flashbacks are unnecessary. So unnecessary that I could consider a kind of filler just to make the episodes last longer. By removing fillers and flashbacks, Naruto could be summed up in very few helpful episodes.
Repetitive soundtrack.
You can predict exactly where each song will be used because we have only one song for each mood. That is why they start to become repetitive and generic.
The fan base.
That could annoy a lot of people, for sure.  As said a few times, Naruto fanboys idolize anime because it is probably the most popular anime and because it must be the first anime they saw.  The anime has many negatives that are obscured by loyal fans who seem to be everywhere, getting annoyed by those who show where the story is bad.
In conclusion, Naruto is the worst anime I've ever seen and can only get the grade on My Anime List because of the huge number of fanboys who worship the anime.  Kishimoto did a terrible job of creating a world and deconstructing his concepts soon after.
 I doubt if I watch Shippuden just to know what happens in this part, but I will definitely have a very low expectation.",2
"
                I tried so hard to like this show I liked the premise (Ya know ninjas) and this was some people's childhoods, but I personally found that's all it really was. The only good thing about this show I can say is the music, other than that the characters suck the only two I actually enjoyed were Rock lee and Hinata as they had actual personalities outside of Dr. Family issues and Mr. I wanna be the best there ever was. Outside of that the story itself is poorly paced with a lot of nothing just to get a something that somehow still wasn't set up
                  very well which make the simple blunders and contradictions that most other shows can get away with painfully and stick out like a sore thumb. Example: Chunin exams during the fight sequences the one girl (on rock lee's team) was set up to be smart but proceeds to do the same thing over and over again even though it was proven to be completely ineffective the first time. Overall I watched way too many episodes of this show but I really wanted to like it, I can't say anything about Shippuden because I frankly don't want to watch it after this. I give this a 3 with the tagline of one of those shows that you shouldn't go back to when you're older.",3
"
                Over quarantine, I tapped in to Naruto after one of my friends convinced me to. What a life changing experience. My views, my taste, my ideology, all changed thanks to this show. This show brings about some of the coolest and heartwarming moments that I have ever seen in anime. I felt so attached to each character. Their best moments, their power ups, their lessons that connected to life, and even some deaths brought me speechless. I may be a little biased, since Naruto kick-started my love for anime, but it’s a MUST WATCH if you’re into shonen. Do not let the hate you hear
                  on social media convince you that Naruto is bad or overrated. It is a phenomenal experience.",9
"
                Naruto is an interesting anime that i don't really know how to explain very well.
This anime is filled with action, sad moments, happy moments, moments of confusion, and many lessons. This anime is also very unique and i would say definitely deserves the high ratings it has. The story, the art, the ideas, and the characters are all completely original and you will definitely not find another anime even similar to this one.
I think it is a nice anime to watch and should be watched.

                naruto is the best main character ever he wants to become the hokage and and he is blonde so he would and dont forget naruto is poor mafi parents gabi homar the guy who threw the mask stupid
Naruto, yes Naruto. One of the series that has defined the cultural shonen’s of the last generation in the history of anime. This is a series that has changed significantly over the past decade.
What I love bout naruto is the whole “Ninja aspect” of the show. Every technique had substance, quality and all of the training arcs really shown the defining elements of how ninjutsu worked within the naruto universe. These qualities are something I will soon not forget. I know alot of people complain about naruto being a half ass wit that can’t do nothing Or perhaps sakura being useless. But in away I look at the series as being a little different, especially in the developing of characters.
Kishimoto did not intend to create the story with a “bad ass” character right from the start, toppling villains one after the other, no. Naruto was set up in a way that much resembles an ordinary life and the tribulations and tests you must go through. Death is at every corner and naruto is a kid that is trying to fit in with the rest of the shinobi and be ""recognized"" I think that was one of the main defining elements of the original series. Kishi wanted to show here is a character that no one likes because he has a living breathing monster inside of him. You can only wonder what he is thinking, being in his predicament.
Watching him grow up as a monster and trying to be known as a famous shinobi and protect his friends, but realizing that he is in a world fraught with danger at every corner. Watching his friends die before him or getting hurt. The degree of emotion in the series was something I really enjoyed. It was really powerful. I remember hearing people spout nonsense in the discussions boards ""omg to much drama, get on with the fighting already"" But I actually liked how naruto had that drama, it fit in with the entire theme of the series. It kind of brings a whole different realism to the show compared to other shonen series. I won’t state any names.
One of the things that kishi really focused on in the original was friendship, and bonds. Thats one of the major theme's watching this team 7 grow up together, learning from kakashi and becoming great ninja in the process, learning the ways of the ninja world. This show explores themes of revenge, hate, bonds and sorrow to a very astounding degree.
The characters in this series were in every sense of the word children, growing up in a world full of adults that were much more talented ninja's both skills and combat. That is not to say the show was made for children. Just that kishi wanted to show the younger generation as the main characters of the show and the older generation as the training shinobi. They had to learn the ropes of what being a ninja is like. After their pre training sessions, they were finally put to the test of just how grueling the world is and how they must use every ounce of there being to survive and also protect the people they love.
10 years ago people viewed naruto very different to how people view it today.
Perhaps maybe the reason I love naruto so much and the reason it feels very nostalgic to me, is because I was around when I watched it first aired and I remember the fanbase during that time of the original series. It was one of THEE most popular anime series on the net and not a single person had anything remotely unscrupulous to say about it. Suddenly after the 100 episode filler arc, or the not so appreciated “shipuuden” it lost its reputation and became a show just muddled by idiots that call any one narutards for watching it. I have seen how the fanbase has changed significantly over the past 10 years of watching naruto. It is quite sad really.
I still consider naruto to be one of my favorite quality anime series, regardless of where it’s going. Perhaps maybe its because im very infatuated with ninja's and like the unique way that kishi has created this ninja world. Similar to how i really love pirates in the one piece world. Every arc is something new and fresh so kishi can develop on that and expand upon the show in various different ways. One piece had some of the greatest character back stories and cast I’ve seen in a series, but it did suffer from story progression a bit thankfully naruto does not. It has a pretty solid pace and some of the most ground breaking plot twists.",10
"
                I watched Naruto during the time I was fourteen and dropped it when I was sixteen shortly after watching Shippuuden. Roughly. I can't remember for sure, seeing as this was nearly a decade ago. It was one of the first animes I ever watched and it was easily one of the longest; I had picked it up as a show to watch as it was the most popular one out there during the time. 
Naruto was the anime that made me realise that just because something is popular, it doesn't necessarily mean that you'll like it. 
Story: 6/10: 
I really enjoyed the premise of the
                  show. A boy who is an outcast because he has a demon trapped inside of him, and because he gets no attention he's a bit of a prankster? Cool. It makes sense. He also wants to be the Hokage and get some recognition and respect when he makes it. 
This is fine - I don't mind this. It's essentially the same as Ash trying to become a Pokemon Master. I also really enjoyed the beginning when Naruto and his two companions (more on these three later) train together with their teacher and one of the other instructors would take Naruto out for ramen every now and then. It was a nice element of realisim and added to the character building which was pretty nice.
When it all really falls apart, is after the Chunin Exam arc. Aka Naurto's class taking part in an official ""to become a Ninja you must pass this test"" exam. The chunin exam is great as you get to see a variety of characters with their own different skills and mindsets and then after that the story kind of... dwindles into boring. 
The arcs are split up into ""someone has a problem-the team agree to fix that problem-fight scene-fight scene-fight scene-backstory-fight scene-fight scene-resolution."" Then near the end Sasuke goes and drowns in the ""emo-angsting-teenager"" pool and runs away with one of the snake villains. YUP. Why they called the next series Naruto:Shippuuden and not just plain Sasuke baffles me. 
A romance element is also added, which really shouldn't have been there. It's kind of like Misty in Pokemon, after a while it becomes painful to watch. They really should've done what they did in One Piece and had No Romance Whatsoever. Friendship between these threewould've been much better. I actively enjoyed Sakura's friendship with Naruto over shipping her with either of her companions. 
Art: 7/10 
The art was pretty good from what I remember, at least it is for something that is more than ten years old. There were no weird gammy faces and the animiation seemed pretty smooth to me. This is from my recollections as a teenager though, so take this with a pinch of salt. 
Sound: 8/10 
Biased on this as I really enjoyed the opening and closing tunes, to the point that I downloaded them and put them on my MP3 player. I doubt I would do the same thing now if I heard these songs for the first time, but at the time they were good. The soundtrack worked pretty well for me. 
Character: 3/10 
What really lets Naruto down as a series is its characters. I've touched on the Chunin Arc already, but what was really great about that arc was the fact that we saw other members of Naruto's class and saw their skills which was really fun. Then when they leave, you remember how mediocre our main cast is and you just want them to come back again. 
Naruto - Naruto is the typical main character who TRIES HIS BEST and SACRIFICES HIS OWN HEALTH to help his friends and he will do anything to become a hokage except, well, he's really stupid. Like, stupid anime stupid. He is only supposed to be a pre-teen so we can let him get away with it, but argh it is not fun to watch. 
Sasuke: Sasuke is great at everything and everyone loves him *swoon*, oh look he glared in my direction I think im in love! Sasuke is one of the reasons I stopped watching this show. Just imagine an emo-teen who thinks the world is out to get him and because of this, takes it out on his friends and people who care about him. This is Sasuke's character. 
Sakura: the girl. She is the girl. This is it to Sakura, which broke my naiive heart a little at fourteen as I was really expecting great things. At the beginning she has the best control over her chakra (essentially what ninjas use to do ninjitsu) and she has high marks in her tests and then.... we find out actually, lol she's just a girl. Let's make her wildly in love with Sasuke and make Naruto in love with her. Even when Sasuke and Naruto get better later on, she'll have a cry about it and then learn the Girl Ninjitsu of Healing. Even though she has super strength, sure she can just heal instead, ok 
The rest of the characters aren't worth mentioning. One of the Hokages is a pervert, one of the hokages has big breasts. Hilarious. Shizune is pretty great, from what I remember though. 
Enjoyment: 4/10 
Sakura being Sakura and Sasuke being Sasuke kills most of the enjoyment from me during this. The beginning of Naruto is great when they work together and beat up small-time criminals but when actual plot happens (and then more importantly the Almighty Terrible Filler Arc happens) it just tumbles further and further downhill and when I watched it, I hoped it would get better. It didn't.
Though, on the plus side, it is at least better than its sequel!",4

                Naruto is about the main character Naruto whose name is the same as the series. He has a past that he knows nothing about, that the fourth Hokage sealed the nine-tailed beast within him, because of that the villagers don`t acknowledged him as a part of the village and ignore him. Because of this he does a lot of pranks to get attention. But in secret he train alot to become strong so they wiil acknowledge him, and one day become Hokage which is his dream. The road Naruto walks on is tough and difficult but he never give up and always go with his
                  ninja way. How he comes over all the obstacles in his path and becomes stronger against all odds is amazing and awesome. Naruto grows stronger and form bonds with others and becomes friends with alot of people, he masters knew moves and techniques from various people and get to know them better. Naruto is my absolutely favourite anime in the world because the character Naruto is much cooler than he looks, the story is well-formed and it gives a whole new feeling about ninjas and their fighting style.",10
"
                It's not bad. All the older otaku call it crap, the noobs praise it like a god, but it's just decent.
Very good characterization, diverse to the point of being hard to keep up with though.
Interesting story to back it up. A few cliches, but not to many.
The only parts that I can really complain about are the dub and filler.
A few of the voices(paticularly Naruto's) just make me clench my teeth.
And the filler, THE F*%$ING FILLER! An episode or two in between arcs? Not bad, somtimes enjoyable. BUT 90+ EPISODES OF FILLER?!
My advice? Watch it. But after the battle at the Valley of the End,
                  go find episode 120 and just skip the filler completely.",7

                Naruto
1% action, 99% flashbacks
I love this anime and yet I hate the anime. It’s all about ninjas. The ideas are great but the story isn’t told well. 
So Naruto has a demon sealed inside him. A demon with nine tails, it’s one of nine tailed demons from the One Tail to the Nine Tails.
Because of this Naruto is hated by the villagers because this demon attacked their village a few years back. Naruto’s dream is to become leader of the village, the Hokage. This is the basic plot so far.
Now my main problem with this anime is that it’s suppose to be an action anime
                  but there isn’t that much action, just a bunch of talking, Naruto constantly makes a speech about how he wants to be Hokaga, Hokage, Hokage. When you think you’re gonna get a cool action sequence they interrupt it with a flashback. And they reuse the same flashbacks over and over and over…
It’s like Dragonball Z, now this is an anime that I love and hate. DBZ’s problem is that they’re always standing around staring at each other, charging their power, etc. But DBZ is better, better action, more interesting villains, etc.
You might enjoy this anime if you watch it online, but back then I didn’t have internet and was forced to watch 1 episode a week, so I didn’t have time to waste with flashbacks. 
Not much to say about Shippudden, Naruto hasn’t changed that much, he still uses the same techniques, the show got more serious but it’s still 1%action 99%flashbacks.
My favorite characters are Mito Guy and Rock Lee, these are I think the only two who actually use martial arts whereas everybody else is using ninjutsu and genjutsu (“magic” techniques)",7

                Ah, Naruto...... The anime that has defined the Shounen battle series for over a decade and then some. Many people love it, many people hate it. Despite all this, Naruto has gone on to be one of the most popular anime of all-time. Here are my thoughts. 
Naruto 
Director: Hayato Date 
Written by: Junki Takegami 
Creator: Masashi Kishimoto
Story (10/10): 
Many people hate the story of Naruto saying that it's cliche, moves way too slowly, has way too much filler, and is boring, and some of these gripes can be true. So how is it a 10/10? Because of the deep and dark plot that develops
                  over time and it allows for you to truly love the show like I did. 
Art (7/10); 
Now, Naruto was my very first anime. So, when I first watched it, I thought that it had the best art ever (10/10). However, looking back, it really doesn't. I am not saying the art sucks. In fact, I think that it was quite good for the early to mid 2000's. But you can't deny there are anime with far better art. (The art in the Manga is much much better). 
Sound (9/10): 
I love the music for Naruto. Especially Go by Flow and Haruka Kanata by ASIAN KUNG FU GENERATION. The Raising Fighting Spirit is one of my all-time favorite anime songs. It is beautiful and always got me hyped for the epic battle that was about to occur. The music can get overused at times (obviously since there are 220 episodes) but I still love it and it is fantastic. 
Character (10/10): 
Quite arguably the best part of Naruto - the characters. Naruto is a character you might hate at first but you'll grow to love him as the series goes on. He's a knucklehead, a loser, a nobody. No one is his friend and no one respects or acknowledges him. However, he strives to see the best in everyone, no matter what. Over time, almost everyone in Honokagakure (Hidden Leaf Village) respects and acknowledges him. Sasuke is a child ninja prodigy with a dark and deep vengeance against his older brother, Itachi. Sakura is a girl ninja who all she does is cheer for Sasuke and Naruto and get in the way of a fight. Many people hate Sakura because of this. However, she acknowledges her own faults later on (especially in Shippuudden). Kakashi is an excellent character as he turns this group of ""idiots"" into a great ninja team which is no small feat. Kakashi is my 2nd favorite anime/manga character of all time behind Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop). There are tons of other amazing characters as well. 
Enjoyment (10/10): 
Despite some of the awful filler, I love Naruto. Always has, always will. It was my very first anime and will always hold a special place in my heart. 
I will never ever forget Naruto and how much of an influence it has made on me. 
Overall (9/10): 
Overall, Naruto is a great anime despite its flaws. Naruto is great, sometimes down, but never out. I do recommend the series, especially if you love Shounen anime. However, skip the filler unless you are a die-hard Naruto fan or you absolutely feel compelled to watch all of an anime including its fillers. 
9/10.",9
"
                I'm a short and sweet kind of reviewer
Overall I do believe that is so is very, very over hyped, at the same time it doesn't live up to it. what I mean is the majority of fans will like it be able to follow the story and have little to no complaints, but people who may have higher standards for animes.
For me this is the first anime I ve watched all of the way through every episode. some of things I liked was the character development, the characters don't have a random spike in power, or just some bullcrap a randomly happen. its a slow
                  steady climb and when the he there peak power is feels natural. another thing I liked was how they pulled your emotions through the story. it was kind of like real life in away. every time a character grew and though they were at the max somebody was better than them and challenged them to grow even more..
some things I hated was the overlapping of episodes. most of them were the filler episodes but there were some cannon episodes did kind of retell what happen the last one and it was the whole episode, or even the origin stories were at least 2-3 episodes long which was annoying to me.
Overall this does hold a special place in my heart as the first anime I watched all the way through, and has I said at the start this is a great anime for people wanting to get into it so I suggest you what it but don't get your hopes to high
P.S IM WAITIG ON A DUBBED VERSION OF 336 OF SHIPPUDEN TO COME OUT PLS I CANT DO SUB",9

                Literally the best anime out there IN MY OPINION. I was about to give up and leave the anime community after trying to watch Sword arts online (SAO) & Dragon Ball (DB) but then I remembered narutos face and googled naruto and then said to myself I have to atleast watch this before I'm done with anime. I enjoyed the first episode a lot and I cried at the scene where Iruka saved Naruto and the sad soundtrack came on. Every since then this has been the favorite serie for me :)
The soundtrack always come on at the right time, the characters look good and
                  the voice acting is really good! I never regret watching naruto ^^ It changed me as a person a bit too, because they bring up a lot of stuff with friendship, teamwork etc.
If you're bored, sad etc try watching naruto and you might get back on your feet again :D
Thank for reading this review and if you did feel free to add me on MyAnimeList

                The series started out well, but as it progressed the characters began to become boring, and the fights seemed too prolonged.
The story wasn&#039;t anything special, in fact I&#039;d say it was below average. It all just seemed way too stretched out.
The art was okay. I&#039;ve always liked the art in the manga. (Although I can&#039;t say that the animation was high quality.)
The sound was okay too. Not bad, but nothing special.
The characters... I just felt that he could have done a lot more with them.
Overall, the series was enjoyable. (or part of it at least.)

                Naruto is the best anime i have ever watched till date. Except from few fillers it has great story line, good characterization and great music. Coming to the characters naruto has been the most influential character besides goku, he wants to be recognized by each and every one in his village who think he is  monster, he overcomes each and every hardships coming in his way to achieve his goal . Naruto also has some epic battles. Naruto will motivate everyone to strive through their hardships and miseries in their life and will definitely impact your life.His tireless days of training, his bombastic and
                  confident, yet sympathetic and righteous attitude are a set of values that I strive towards.",10
"
                Story: Naruto is about a boy who is misunderstood and Wants to become hokage someday. As it turns out he deals with lots of problems that your average person wouldn't deal with. For example: Being an outcast, Not having his parents around, Having to prove others wrong time and time again..... The story is basically about the main character and The story only gets better within the next series which is Naruto: Shippuden. 
Art: The art is much better than your average shounen, as a matter of fact I would go as far to say that it's better than the animation for Bleach and No,
                  That isn't a joke either. The art style is close to being in the same tier as Fullmetal Alchemist or One Punch Man. 
Sound: The Intros/Outros are something that Naruto does perfectly and You can tell from the amazing Rock n Roll or Japanese Folk music being played. Simply put the amount of Intros/Outros within this anime are amazing and It would be hard for me to even choose a favorite for either topic. 
Character Development: Character development is obviously there, as we see Naruto mature more and more. In the beginning you would get this immature and annoying vibe from him, but Later on in the series you see he starts to mature and Becomes more serious about his dreams. Side characters also have development which is always a good thing. Cause your average shounen hardly ever pays attention to the side characters. 
Personal Enjoyment: I personally enjoyed Naruto very much and Would like to thank my Little brother for getting me into Naruto in the first place. As a matter of fact all my friends we're into Naruto. From buying the games for Gamecube and Playstation to buying the merchandise and The posters and So on and So fourth. I really did enjoy the show that much! 
Overall: In all honesty Naruto is an Amazing anime and People need to see it before hating on it. It's has everything that most people would enjoy from Character development, Perfect intros/outros, and Overall a great story. 
I rate Naruto a 9 OUT OF 10 
Naruto is an Amazing Anime! 
Pros:
Perfect Story
Perfect Character Development
Perfect Intros/Outros
Cons:
The Filler
There Are 38 Vols To Collect In DVD Format ( JOKING xD )
Hope you enjoyed my review and I will be back to make more reviews and Content for my YouTube channel.",9

                So, Naruto. The first anime I watched, back when I was 8. I rewatched it recently and deciced review it.
Naruto is a Masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, I know it has a lot of flaws, but the positives aspects outway massively the negatives ones. So, let's get started:
The story: amazing and unique. It talks about an alternative world where most of the population are ninjas, that do missions to help their villages and can do special techniques/ attacks with hand signals and 'chakra'. The commedy was , for the most part, funny ; the mistery was enthralling. The pacing was decent, not being great because
                  of some filler episodes.
The art: honestly, is the weakest part of this anime (as well as the animation). The beginning especially, although we can forgive it because it is from 2002. It gets progressively better and better as the episodes go on. The animation is fine too.
The sound: awesome! I can't say if the japanese voice actors fit the characters or if they were good (beacuse I watched in my native language, not japanese - in my language they did fit the characters and were good). The music and sound effects were amazing. Sad songs to make you feel,  inspiring / 'fighting' songs to get you hyped and excited.
The characters: very good too. Of course there are some steriotyped characters, but overall they were interesting, and they did a good job developing secundary characters' personalities and backstories. I thing I found fascinating while watching Naruto was that you see the evolution of the characters. They grow, deteriorate and learn with their experiences, throughout the series.
Maybe part of why I love Naruto so much is beacuse it feels very nostalgic to me, but I am sure you can enjoy it even if that doesn't apply to you. I really enjoyed this anime, and it will be forever in my heart. 10/10",10

                Naruto was the anime that originally got me into anime. I remember watching the first episode back when I was 14 and being blown away by how much fun this show was. I loved the characters , especially Kakashi , the humor and especially the action scenes. I found Naruto to be very relatable as a protagonist and enjoyed watching him grow throughout the series. The world was very colorful and the cast of characters was equally so. 
However , even with rose colored glasses on Naruto is no masterpiece. The plot for certain arcs can fell very dragged out and as a result can
                  get boring. The show can also get quite repetitive  and the character progression becomes minimal in my opinion. Also , as everyone knows the shear amount of filler in unreal .. I watched a good chunk of it for completions sake but intimately found it boring and I dropped it as an anime as a result. Compared to  similar shows such as My hero Acedemia and FMAB, the plot and characters just are not as good and I would recommend them over Naruto. In saying that if your looking for a fun , action packed show and like the ninja premise  I would still give Naruto a go.",6
"
                Naruto is one of the most popular anime series out there. Does it deserve it's praise... well... Let's get started with some things I DISLIKED about the series.
-Some episodes are dragged out WAY too long. For example, the dialogue is extended and there are so many sequences when the characters are just staring at each other without accomplishing nothing. 
-The music wasn't exactly the best. Yes, it is iconic and nostalgic, but a lot of the music sound like one of the fail flute memes you see on the internet that was pretty popular back then. 
-This is an overdone argument against Naruto but... Sakura
                  really sucks. She is the definition of the wasted potential of a MAIN SHONEN CHARACTER
Now that's out of the way, what did I LIKE about Naruto
-The characters were so unique. Their abilities were so dissimilar and interesting. Every character got a chance to shine in the original series.
-The emotion felt real and raw. Whenever a character went through a hardship throughout the show, you truly felt their pain. 
-The show had great themes and morals.
-The rivalry between Naruto and Sasuke was well blended and executed. Throughout the series, the two rivals start becoming similar and power levels, and it escalates till the final canon arc in the show.
-The fathership that Jiraiya has developed with Naruto is sweet. It adds extra character development for both Naruto and Jiraiya.
-The power levels were just fine. It established skilled characters, and how Naruto came to overcome them without becoming ridiculous
-The fights. Amazing what can I say. Fluid animation, amazing sound effects, and loads of choreography and action when they aren't being dragged out by dialogue and pointless flashbacks
Now, do I recommend everyone to watch Naruto Part 1? No. This show is very long, and its successor is even longer. If you have the time and patience to see a slow story develop into something truly lovable and amazing, I would recommend a commitment to watch the series if you're interested to see what the hype is about.",8

                Naruto has changed my life for the better, growing up with it in my childhood it really helped me through some tough times. I absolutely adore this anime even with its glaring flaws, like, for example, the story sometimes gets mixed up and doesn't make sense a bit of the time. Even with those, it's an outstanding anime that I would rewatch thousand times over.
But again, there are major flaws. They tend to make some characters bland or not even give them enough screen-time to flesh them out, characters like TenTen are really good examples of a good idea but not enough screen-time. Not to
                  mention, Sakura, a main character, had hardly any screen-time and was the bland female companion to slow down everybody. Bringing it back up, the story sometimes gets a bit mixed up in itself which can lead to confusion or completely backing up on something to make it work. I get it, the whole series was 720 episodes you can't really predict what'll happen in the next 700 episodes, but storyboarding exists for a reason. 
People wonder why I like Naruto as much as I do, but I gotta say it's mainly because of just the overall appeal of it. Who doesn't like a story about ninjas who can do cool techniques featuring elemental styles? Not to mention there are some techniques that are a mixture of elements for specific people or clans, it's really just an overall great concept. Not to mention I really enjoy some of the characters, one of my personal favorites is Neji because he was a really fleshed-out character with motives that seemed reasonable.
All in all if you wanted to, I'd advise recommending this to your friends or even watch it yourself. It's a good watch and it'll definitely fill up a lot of time and boredom.",10

                This review is covering Naruto and it's sequel 'Naruto Shippuden' as I view them as inseparable.
Firstly, the story is an epic juggernaut. It ramps up and plateaus, ramps up again, takes you off cliff-hangers, makes you cheer, makes you cry. Some may say it is a little drawn out, others may say that there are too many filler episodes but everything adds to the crescendo, making character specific plot points that bit more meaningful. The world building of Naruto is second to none.
The art of Naruto evolved over the many years it was in production, it has many of the most recognisable characters in all
                  of anime, and dozens of its fight scenes are just pure, visual ecstasy.
The music in Naruto has more depth than the pacific ocean. It has great music throughout its 700+ episodes that I listen to in my lorry to this day.
Character development is simply a masterpiece. Untouchable. Not sure how else to put it into words.
Enjoyment, again, is unquantifiable. It changes peoples lives, Naruto transcended it's own genre like Muhammad Ali with boxing and Michael Jordan with Basketball.
Overall, I can only give a 10 to my favourite anime of all time. Yes 700+ episodes may seem daunting, but it's an experience you will never regret or forget.",10

                I love this shit, ever since 8th grade when I started this show its made me feel nostalgia no other show has ever made me feel. God damn, shippuden kinda dissapointed me but this, this shit rocks. This show deeper than anime, the life lessons actually meant something and kinda shaped my life into me wanting to be a hardworking person. The nostalgia when I think about being a kid watching this show is overwhelming. Never in my life have I cried over a show, unless i tried to i dont think I would be able to cry. But Naruto, the nostalgia, it made me
                  so happy yet sad as I reminised over my childhood and the sheer happiness I had when I saw this show. I can understand why people think its overhyped, you need the right conditions to experience this fucking masterpiece. Make this the first anime you watch, dont watch another one for a month and let the nostalgia roll in. I love this show and it will always be dear to my heart",10
"
                When I first starting watching Naruto I thought I wasn't going to enjoy it and thought it was going to be a bad anime, but now I am watching Naruto Shippuden. I always hear that if you watch Naruto and enjoy it your weeb trash but Naruto had a great story, great characters, and it was very enjoying to watch. When Jirayia was introduced it made me think, so is this just the stereotypical perverted anime character? at first I did think it but when Jirayia started teaching Naruto I learned he is much more of a deep character. When Sasuke got the curse mark
                  and became more powerful it made me think ""Is Sasuke now an equal to Naruto?"" due to me not knowing of Naruto being a Jinchuriki. When Naruto first had a the nine-tails chakra leaked out it left me confused. When Gaara was introduced I thought he was going to be a main villian but he turned out to be a Jinchuriki and be converted to the good side. So if you think Naruto is weeb trash watch it and you will most likely enjoy it.",10
"
                If you're reading this, you may have heard of the title ""Big Three"" given to those three long-running shounen anime, two of which are still airing, that have most enraptured and inspired young males around the world in the modern era -- Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece. Don't be intimidated by these shows' lengths; I was too at first, but after starting them I didn't want to stop. It may be a long journey, but all the more to relish and savor that moment when you finally finish, when you can sit back and think back to when it all began and how much stronger
                  the characters have become and comparing the beginning and the end; that is what I look forward to when watching such an anime.
Before I begin, I'll get to the bad things. Being such a long anime, and being based off manga that is the work of one man, it's only natural to have filler. If the anime's got to the point where they can't release more episodes based on the manga (the mangaka's only got so much time and energy, after all), they have to make some filler to ""fill"" in the gaps between canon content. Now, I can understand the feelings of fans who watched Naruto back when it aired and had to wait so long between episodes 135 and 220 (136-219 being filler) week after week; but this review applies when those fans can watch anime not on the TV screen, easily skip such filler, and watch just the original storyline.
Second, there's always criticism of the lackluster animation. Look, Studio Pierrot doesn't have the time or the money to dedicate itself to produce the same scintillating quality as seen in most 1- or 2-cour anime. Take Tokyo Ghoul, for instance, done by the same studio but having some of the best visuals and lighting effects I've ever seen in any anime -- that was only 24 episodes for both seasons total. Given this fact, Naruto still does pretty well, and the animation's not the #1 thing to look for in an anime.
Third, the heavy presence of fighting. These characters are like all ninjas, who by definition spend their lives training and fighting, so such an aspect is only natural.
Now... where do I begin?
Like One Piece with its protagonist, Naruto's has a dream that drives him to keep going and ultimately inspires others also -- to become Hokage, the head ninja of his village, and finally gain the recognition that he could never have as a child. Like the lead characters of several popular shounen anime, Naruto Uzumaki is kinda stupid and silly but when he's down, he always gets back up. Watching his growth from episode 1 to episode 220 was quite the experience -- and I'm not done yet, I'm now watching Naruto: Shippuuden and the story's still going strong as ever but even better. I'm telling you, it's worth it, tackling a long show such as this. There are deep plot threads waiting to be unraveled, really powerful characters to meet, dreams to be achieved. (Naruto lays down the foundation for the overarching plot of the story and details the characters, whereas Naruto: Shippuuden takes on the main conflict.)
What Naruto does particularly well is developing its characters. Unlike One Piece, which focuses more on worldbuilding and plot development, Naruto emphasizes the personalities, backstories, and unique strengths and weaknesses of its primary characters. The three main ones, Naruto and Sakura and Sasuke especially; but besides them, there are their fellow ninjas and friends, and taking it all in together including the bad guys' stories it's a fine thing. The more you watch them interact with each other, the more real and individually human they feel. Since ninjas carry out missions in four-man teams, each team has its own chemistry, which is always nice to see. Masashi Kishimoto excels in illustrating the growth of each of his respective main characters; several times during the series I teared up after a flashback and/or reminiscing upon how much they’ve grown.
As I said before, anime studios can’t by their very nature do a superb job with the animation. So don’t be surprised when you encounter repeated shots during fight scenes. However, in contrast with Pierrot’s other main work Bleach, the fights are more fluid and thus more enjoyable to watch. These are ninjas, after all, so they do a lot of hand-to-hand combat. Many youths have probably played ninja inspired by Naruto over the years. The artwork is often underlain by a soft, almost sepia-like tone, which lends itself to the mood during important fight scenes.
Speaking of fighting, Kishimoto concludes most of them quite intelligently -- that is, often ninjas employ deception and multiple layers to their moves during combat, so usually they don’t end up the way you would expect. Like for reiatsu in Bleach and Devil Fruits in One Piece, ninjas fight using chakra from their bodies in various ways, from summoning animals to manipulating the elements to walking upside down on tree branches. Thus there is a myriad number of unique fighting styles beyond the simple kick and punch and kunai knife. The one drawback is that some fights last through several episodes, but watching Naruto today that can be overcome easily by watching the episodes back to back.
I wasn’t too stimulated by the soundtrack. Hearing the tribal-esque war shouts over and over again irked me a bit. That being said, the music is mostly comprised of percussion, emphasis of wind instruments (e.g. flute), and a fast-paced rhythm. It does suit the ninja environment, however.
In terms of enjoyment, I watched Naruto sporadically until around episode 55, at which point things got going and I watched mostly just Naruto until I finished the series. The main thing that encouraged me to keep watching was the quality of the fights, which in my opinion surpasses those in Bleach (for the most part). Then again, don’t expect an anime in the hundreds of episodes to enthrall you for the entire time. It’s worth it, though, to watch it through, to see how much these guys grow.
It is human nature to desire love, and recognition. This is the tale of a young man on a journey of friendship, loyalty, becoming stronger, and ultimately showing the shinobi world his own Way of Ninja.",9

                I'm partial to Naruto, given the nostalgia that surrounds it, but in all honesty it's not impressive. However, a generation was moved by the story and experience. In my personal opinion, if something is that powerful to that many people, it must have done something right, even if it was an accident.
Naruto in general is very good at harnessing the anticipation of progression. It's skill isn't as refined as others, and it tends to be rough around the edges, but throughout the series (so long as you aren't too sceptical) you'll generally be hanging on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, it does suffer from
                  a severe issue with length. The series is tough to enjoy if you aren't going through it at a blistering pace, and it's held back by the fact that each episode needs to be twenty minutes, and you can't move any faster than that.
The series is also good at delivery, at least in the first half. Each arc has a sense of motion, and each has a thing to teach the main protagonist. Unfortunately, a little more than halfway through the series it cuts into a long chain of filler episodes, and it doesn't resume canon until the sequel series Naruto: Shippuden. This wouldn't be that bad, except for most of the filler episodes the quality is drastically lowered, and there isn't much story progression. That alone lowers the score of this review.
The story itself was creative for its time, and it definitely is an interesting direction for a setting to travel in. This is less indicative of Naruto than it is a trend in long-runners themselves. In general the longest running series will have the best world building by virtue of inertia. Naruto stands out in that it immerses you in the premise within the span of a single episode, allowing you to better enjoy what is to come. However, by not having a slow burn like Bleach, it leaves the main circle of characters unattached. It isn't until about 60 episodes in, when the second real arc ends, that you finally get to know all of the major characters involved in the series, and it isn't until the very last arcs that they are really utilized to their fullest. Even if all of the characters have unique and interesting personalities, without introducing the audience to them, the audience will never learn to like them.
By far the best aspect of the show is its music and voice acting. A lot of big names in the industry got their start or were involved in Naruto as of it's original run, dubbed and in the original Japanese, including people like Nana Mizuki or Yuri Lowenthal. On the music side of things, most of the songs are classic. I consider the soundtrack of Naruto to be great considering they only had about 40 songs to work with for about three times as many episodes. That's not including the openings, though, which were hit and miss.
I enjoyed it a lot when I watched it as a kid. It doesn't hold up to that nostalgia as well as it could, but it's far from awful, and I think if you're not used to casting a critical eye on things, it could be the kind of show for you. Even if you are critical, I've seen some recuts that fix pacing issues and such - the show may not be all that bad if you watch it with the intent of skipping flashbacks or filler.
Either way, your enjoyment is up to you.",6
"
                This is my first review, so please forgive me if I make grammar mistakes as English isn't my first language
Naruto is a show that many have grew up with, many people love this anime and I have lots of friends who told me Naruto was the first anime they've watched, even Naruto was the first anime I've watched. But enough of bias opinions, I'm here to tell you whether or not you should watch this show.
Story:
The story is simple to follow and isn't difficult to understand, although some points in the story it's starts to downgrade and begins to become a bit sloppy, the show
                  is 220 episodes long and does it ever feel to slow down? Yes it does sometimes, I wasn't completely upset by this as I still enjoyed the story till it's finish line.
Overall: 7
Art:
The animation unfortunately isn't very consistent, it sometimes dips in quality and can look really bad sometimes, other times it can look great where it's concentrated at best, some of the fight scenes in this show can be done good or bad. thankfully the majority of them are good(in my opinion at least) 
Overall: 6
Sound:
The music in this show really is one of the best aspects about this show, the most notable one is probably the sad tones which stand out the most, especially in emotional scenes. Even when the battles start the music gets you pumped up and excited.
Overall: 8
Character:
There is a large cast of characters in this show, there are some good and some bad characters, Naruto can be found annoying sometimes and it's easy to see why, the character designs are unique and it's an underrated aspect of the show, each character looks and sounds different, with different morals and goals which makes the characters so beloved in the Naruto series.
Overall: 7
Enjoyment:
You can enjoy the series a lot, watching Naruto getting better and learning from his mistakes gives you a feeling of happiness, unfortunately the show has a lot of fillers which are one of the biggest drawbacks of this show, fortunately you can easily skip these episodes by searching online filler and non-filler episodes of Naruto and you can end up enjoying the series a lot.
Overall: 8
So should you watch this show? Yes, It's a show with many flaws but can still enjoy it on certain level, just don't have high expectations or you will be severely disappointed.",7

                  Piece etc. Other than that it’s OK!
Characters:
They are so unlike  these characters, a stubborn one, one seeking for revenge etc.. 
Naruto is a very social boy with a lot of energy, he is obsessed to be the hokage one day and he likes ramen..

Sakura is a cheerfullgirl with a lot of competive instncts and a bad inner self. 
Kakashi the most chilled ninja in Konoha. Kakashi loves to read one certain book series called Icha-Icha or make out series.
Sound:
Naruto has one of the rocked anime opening that I  likes plus I love the sad OST, the ending is nothing out of the other world, but it’s ok. 
Enjoyment: This anime has it’s good and bad momements, but i enjoyed it.
Overall: Naruto is a okay anime to watch, but you’ll get a bit frustrated about the fillers. If you like good figts and can endure the fillers Naruto is something for you!",7

                Introduction
*Skip this paragraph if you don't want to read me blabbering on and on and want to go to the story review part.*
Naruto is a great anime that I have watched so far, I started off with Naruto Shippuden at first because I didn't know about the original Naruto. I then, held on to Naruto Shippuden at about episode 200 when I found out about Naruto. After I started the first few episodes, I was very hooked and it seemed really cool seeing Naruto when he was young and knowing the back stories of Naruto. I finished watching all the episodes in about 1-2 weeks,
                  due to the fact that I was on Summer Break and had the whole day free to do as I please. 
Story 9/10
In the beginning of the anime, the first few episodes was great. They gave me tears when I was watching them because it was both joyful and sad. 
Later on, the story began to get me very hooked due to all the action, friendship, and training in it. It taught me many lessons and got me thinking. The fighting and action in it was enjoyable and didn't last too long or too short like many other action anime. 
What made me give a 9/10 instead of a 10 full was because:
First, I didn't like the too many fillers that didn't relate to the story and was very boring.
Second, the fighting was repetitive,
Lastly, I didn't like the flash backs that Naruto had *SPOILER* about Sakura, Sasuke, and him. *END OF SPOILER*
(Or if you want to avoid the boring parts, skip to the Overall Review)
Art and Sound 10/10
First of all, the art was great considering when the anime was made. The art included lots of detail and the colouring was great. 
Next, the sound for the dub that I was watching was very good. I didn't notice any mistakes in it at all.
I might have lots of Spoilers here during the Character Review so if you don't want any spoilers, skip to Enjoyment Review
Character 7/10
The characters were okay but *SPOILER* I didn't really like how Naruto's personality was being all goofy and weak.
I personally didn't like how Sakura treated Naruto very poorly, and Sasuke like he was the hero of everything. 
I also didn't like how all Naruto's classmates including his friends, Sakura and Sasuke treated Naruto and bullied him. But I guess the bullying made Naruto stronger and not weak anymore.
The last thing I didn't like was how Sasuke showed off all the time and called Naruto a loser.  *END OF SPOILER*
Now, moving on to what I did like. *SPOILER* I liked how Naruto's character developed from a weak crying boy, into a strong, never giving up kid.
I also really liked the scene when Naruto fought Kabuto to save Tsunade and him not giving up even though he had little chance of beating Kabuto. *END OF SPOILER*
Enjoyment 10/10
Even though there were some minor things that I didn't like, I really did enjoy this anime. It is one of the few best anime I've watched. This anime is really enjoyable and if you haven't watched it yet, GO WATCH IT NOW!
Overall 9/10
This anime is just great with some minor mistakes/annoyance in it. As I said in the Enjoyment Review, if you haven't watched this anime, GO WATCH IT NOW!!",9
"
                I was in 10th grade when I saw my first five minutes of Naruto, I promptly shut off the TV and went on with my daily life.  However, over the years, I began to want to know what the story was about, so I picked up the manga.  From reading the manga, I learned the best way to enjoy Naruto is in sections.  The minute it started to annoy me, I put it down and read something else.  The same applies to the anime.  It's just to big to fully enjoy it in one go and eventually the story will
                  grate on you.
Story:  The story is pretty good.  It follows the plot of the manga really well.  I even enjoyed some of the filler arcs.  What they brought to the table as far as expanding on manga plot, was really interesting.  What lacked though was they tended to repeat the same plot line in the fillers, which got to be annoying.
Art:  The art was fair.  It was nice to see the village and characters in color, but the animation tended to be lazy.  For manga plots, episodes seemed to go on and on and showed repeated animation.  For example, how many scenes do we need of Kiba floating down a river holding a branch over his head?  One or two would suffice, but I lost count at five because of how ridiculous it was getting.
Sound:  The sound was very good.  I loved the soundtrack to the show.  The music never failed to hype me up and it made me shed a few tears during emotional moments.  As a lover of music, it really makes or breaks a show for me as far as emotional connection goes.
Character:  They did a good job with the manga characters, however, the same does not apply to the filler characters.  They were so forgettable, I would forget there names right after there arc would end.  They also didn't have personality.  The only filler character I remotely cared about was Isaribi, who I had to look up to even remember her name.  They also all tended to act the same in every arc.
Enjoyment:  The series was enjoyable.  I looked forward to every box set I got in the mail.  When it got to be annoying, I would shut it off for a few weeks until I gained interest again.
Overall:  The series was fair.  It had it's flaws and sometimes I asked myself if this was the same series I started off watching, but I would stop watching it for a few weeks and I would come back to it refreshed.  To watch Naruto, you have to have an open mind and willpower to deal with the mass amount of filler.  And you have to understand that if it is not for you, then it is not for you.",6
"
                The beginning was good the Haku arc was interesting but then it just became nothing but fillers and stupid episodes of nothing.
Main character is always looking like a dumbass, and even his strong moments arent that cool at all. He only gets interesting when the Kyuubi is involved.
His crush on the main heroine, Sakura is sickening.
The whole Sasuke leaving and becoming a badass is soo...ugh.
I have no idea why Naruto gets soo much boost, but w/e
its worth watching. Just dont become a crazed fan.

                Started with potential, then should have been renamed Sasuke thus the story is pathetic. the art was good, though I watched it really long ago. The sound of the American Naruto's voice makes my ears bleed, though I assume they're referring to the sound effects. The characters are weird, and not the good weird.

                To be honest, Naruto is the most overhyped show in existence. Everyone goes on and on and on about how great it is; and my expectations for this show was equally high. However, I was really, really let down. Really. This wasn't the best show ever, as I had thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, the show is enjoyable, but it's definitely not among the best shows out there. I hope Shippuden will better than this... much better.
The concept of this show isn't that hard to follow. It's an alternate world in which ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and
                  they have this power flowing inside of them called chakra. Chakra is used to perform powerful attacks which (usually) belongs to either of the five traditional elements of earth, fire, water, air and lightning. Of course, since they are ninjas, they fight with weapons like shuriken and kunai as well as hand-to-hand combat. As expected of this kind of world, there's evil people, having different goals and reasons behind their evil.
The story follows Naruto, one of these ninjas, as he grow as a ninja, from being a stupid little prank-playing brat to becoming a fine ninja. Along the way, he interacts with and makes friends with many fellow ninja, fighting his way towards his dream of becoming Hokage (the leader of his village). 
The story isn't nearly as good as the concept would indicate. Sure, a lot of the characters has some nice background stories, won't complain about that, but they manage to drag out everything so much. It really annoys me. Some fights take several episodes when they could've been done them just as good in one or two. There's also way too much fighting. The story goes like fight, fight, background story, fight, fight, even more fight, half an episode's worth of resting or journeying, fight, fight, and so on. I mean, it's cool to watch fights, but there are just way too many fights, and they drag most of them out to unnecessary lengths. The only really enjoyable fight was the one between Sasuke and Naruto right before the fillers began. Which brings up another thing...
Fillers! Agh, I normally don't mind fillers, but Naruto had some really, really stupid ones. Sure, there was the occasional diamond among the charcoal, but that doesn't excuse the high amount of bad fillers. I mean, just because they are fillers doesn't mean that they have to make them bad. Several shows have actually made decent and at the same time long fillers (especially Bleach, with its 40-episode long Bount arc), but Naruto failed horribly here. 
Also, I feel that Naruto is very silly at times. Silly is usually good, but not when it's immature silly. And guess what+ Naruto is silly in an immature way. It's so dreadfully stupid at times that I had to close my eyes, take a deep breath and wait until it got serious again. Now, it did have some good comical moments, but those were far and wide between.
Another thing I feel like releasing my rage on is the animation. It barely manages to get the description &ldquo;average&rdquo; to me. At its best, it's slightly above average. However, a lot of time it's slipshod galore with the animation. I still have many very bad memories from having to watch lots of errors in the animation, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get rid of those memories. While the amount of errors decreased as the episodes passed by, at least every second episode before the 100s had one or more moments of slipshod animation. Wonder if they ever considered firing the animators.
As a side mention, they should do something about Rock Lee - even though I've slightly gotten used to his horrible looks, I still feel a burn in the back of my eye every time I see him.
The music is pretty good, though. A lot of great tunes (especially the sad ones are great), and the first few OPs and EDs were pretty awesome. It has some really bad music parts too, like the tribal voice-ish song, and sometimes they could've used better themes during the fights. As the series progressed, the quality of the OPs and EDs decrease too.
The characters are fairly okay, I guess. Some of them are really annoying, like Naruto, because he's so stupid. Agh, he annoys me to no end! Some other characters are annoying too, because of things like their looks (Gai and Lee), or because they are failed attempts at comical relief (at least in my eyes, you might find them funny), like the all too perverted Jiraiya.
That's the negative about them. However, they have some really nice background stories, some which are elaborated more upon than others. Many of the characters also get fair amounts of screen time, which for some people can seem too much, whilst others will be content with it, because their favorite character from the show gets an episode for him/herself. 
I also like the fact that most of them have dreams or aspirations, and motives for what they are doing and how they are acting (usually it's tied together with their background stories). The growing relationships between them is also nice, their maturing, and how Naruto is slowly getting accepted by more and more people through hard work. 
Basically, they've portrayed the characters very well, and not too over the top, but some of them act stupid and silly from time to time, which drags the character rating down.
I have some mixed feelings for the show, which kind of drags down on the enjoyability factor of it. Great concept, not as good story, both good and bad music, horrid animation at times, many characters with background stories, some of them great and some not-so-great; it's hard to completely make up my mind, but I believe the ratings I have given shows my feelings towards the different aspects of the show.
Of course, even though there was things I didn't like, I can easily see why this show is so popular as it is; it has humor that the kids may find funny, as well as lots of fights which appeal to the teenagers and adults. I personally didn't like it that much, though. I'm looking forward to Shippuden, because I&rsquo;ve heard it was much better&hellip; I really hope so!

                Naruto is a delightful anime which is most definitely fun for all ages. Don't get me wrong, it can't be considered a masterpiece which has transcended the Shounen genre. However, to deny Naruto's impact on the anime world is foolish.
For many people (including myself) Naruto was the gateway into watching anime with more depth than the Shounen Jump series. But what is it that makes Naruto such a great gateway anime to watch? Is it the characters who can come off as either incredibly layoured (think Itachi) and the enjoyable (if not basic) story telling or is it simply down to the remarkable action scenes
                  and animation which the show can sometimes offer.
Personally I find the entire journey that our protagonist goes on riveting from start to finish. The characters around them and the way they affect him are real to the story. Whilst the protagnonist can come off as an annoying brat near the start of the show the emotional depth that is layered upon him keeps the viewer rooting for the little guy to win. 
The supporting cast can be a mixed bag with some characters having incredibly detailed backstorys and depth and some falling flat as little more than comic relief or exposition drops (looking at you Tenten). In the later series some of the characters who were built up in Naruto also seem to drop off the map in favour for a more streamlined focus on Naruto and his rival Sasuke Uchiha which can be polarizing at best.
While the supporting cast can range from excellent to lackluster, one thing which Naruto suceeds over most Shounen anime is the incredible variety of villains which the show has to offer, most of which come with incredibly deep and heartbreaking backstories which perfectly parallel our protagonist. Whether it is the perfect opposite of Naruto in the form of Gaara to the incredible range shown from the Akatsuki, you will always find yourself accidentally rooting for the protagonist to win.
The world itself I feel is also deep and meaningful to the story of Naruto. Whether it dates as far back as the story of the Sage of the Six Paths or more recent events such as the Nine Tailed Fox's attack on the Hidden Leaf, almost everything has a connection to the story and doesn't feel entirely forced.
In summary, Naruto is a charming little anime to watch if you want to have a good time. It is not entirely groundbreaking (taking the global success of the series out of the equation) but if you are like myself, you might find yourself having an enjoyable ride with this show.",8

                Most people stop watching this anime in favor of Naruto: Shippuden, and I could see why. There are dozens of episodes of filler. For most of the series, the story is great. The character development is worthy of praise, and also.... NINJAS. However, this series does have its cons, beside the aforementioned filler. Pretty much everything in this anime is recycled to use over and over again. The story, the music, the scenery, etc. However, if you are willing to put up with all of that (like I was), then you will enjoy watching this series until it ends.

                Naruto
Without a doubt one of my first anime that I started watching when I was a child. And the first season of Naruto even today is not bad in my opinion and can be quite entertaining. What happened in the second season after the Timeskip is of course a different story.
Masashi Kishimoto actually created a very individual work, which is extremely popular to this day. The man was resourceful, which in turn was lacking in writing style, structure, and explanations.
The whole topic of the ninja and the corresponding word building, the fighting techniques, and the chakra system. It has at least been well thought out.
                  The world-building fits the setting but is only average.
The actual main story of Naruto only takes place in the next season and this practice serves as an oversized prologue to build up all the happenings, relationships, and characters. Some of it has succeeded at least subtly.
This season also focuses enormously on character development and various different ""training arcs"". Of course, as I said, there are also some main events that are relevant to future events, but their number is very small. For the most part, this season contains many inconsequential filler episodes with very little tension. But the individual ninja fights with satisfactory choreography compensate for this to some extent.
However, the characters are enormously problematic in the work. First and foremost, yes the supporting characters are actually far more interesting in Naruto than the actual 3 main characters. However, they do not get the screen time they deserve and are often more like sidekicks or only there for individual scenes. The focus is on Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura. The legendary trio of the boring 3.
Naruto is the typical 0815 protagonist you know and annoys everyone with his ""datebayo"" and his affectionate tsundere manner. He is not, however, hateful.
Sakura is the bare definition of a protagonist who feels no purpose. Her entire role in the work is that of a supporting character who was only born a sidekick. She has no background, no real ambitions, no character. In the course of the series she develops into a stronger fighter, but the mangaka had little love for her and has left her out again.
And Sasuke was by far the worst of them all. His approach and motivations seem understandable at first, even if his personality is enormously pubescent. However, it does not develop in the course of the work and repeatedly shows how easy it is to manipulate. He's the ""Anakin Skywalker"" that nobody really wanted. Yes, he had the potential to be a tremendously good character, but it all got messed up.
Without exaggeration, Kakashi was by far the most interesting and best character in the series and not just this season. He should have been the protagonist.
For the worse part, a large part of the time was not invested in the existing characters, but in many supporting characters who from then on had little relevance to the story.
Animations are split. On the one hand, they are good, on the other hand, they often have hardly any dynamism and monotonous representation. For the most part, this does not apply to most of the glossy moments where the animations were massively increased.
Musically, Naruto is generally very beautiful. The individual Osts are enormously individual and support the scenes splendidly. Also, most of the intros have a very solid and appealing quiet and are imprinted on the memory.
The first season of Naruto is ultimately a pleasant prologue that unfortunately doesn't have much to offer and has been drawn out enormously. The potential was there, but unfortunately, the mangaka did not use it much. As the second season progressed, things got even worse. He had an approach to the story, but didn't know how to actually implement it and had even less plans for the finale.

                i was a big fan of this manga & show when i was in elementary school
but as the time i grow up i kinda find the story too monotonous but it doesn't mean it's boring.
Story [9/10] acually the plot and the universe is masterpiece, pretty interesting and well made, but as i grow up reading this manga, it's kinda like lacking something... i wonder what it is..
Art [10/10] but i have no objection with the art & animation is superb, the action and all is the best! if i would compare to any other anime that have combat action scene i think naruto is one
                  of the top list!
Sound [9/10] the thing that make the anime feels badass is the soundtrack of course! the authentic japanese style ost definitely left a great impression to the audience, especially who watch it as a kid will feels this nostalgic feeling when re-hearing the bgm of this anime >.<
Overall[8/10] well it's a masterpiece anyway and everybody knows about this anime existence
HOWEVER!!
my intention to write this review is there's one thing that i really want to praise of this series!
especially only for this series not the shippuden!
for any other long running shounen manga that adapted to anime..
SOMEHOW.. i found naruto filler episode is the best!
even i kinda skipped one piece filler episode, but there are interesting filler episode of naruto that become my fav!
because it has a lot of character, the filler makes it great how its create more story about the side character and how the relationship between each other!
SO don't skip the FILLER EPISODES! because some of them are worth watching and quite funny!",8
"
                Yo fine people of myanimelist.net, I'm about to set this whole Naruto debacle to rest so sit tight, get a blanket and get damn comfy cause this is coming rough and raw.
Let me start by saying you need to get rid of your f**ks all of them until there's nothing left but a child like sense of wonder and a hunger for adventure with a thirst for escaping reality  , put them f**ks  in a basket or a storage cabinet somewhere where you can use them for an anime that is thought provoking because that isn't Naruto.
What Naruto is ladies and gentlemen is
                  a quest of the imagination and an adventure of the soul, It ain't gonna tease your brain, It ain't gonna make you fall madly in love with characters in fact more than a few will piss you off BUT ladies and gentlemen what Naruto will do is have you coming back episode after episode like a crack cocaine fiend.
How you ask? Why through none other than damn fine story telling, good and at times beautiful artwork and sheer blunt enjoyment. Time for some further detail folks. We gonna start with the good and work toward the worse here.
STORY
Most synopsis of Naruto state that it's the tale of a young boy Naruto Uzimaki and his quest to become the greatest village leader in the history of the village (Through brutal ninja slaughter of other villages) but i'd like to say that it's just the base story (there is a multitude of and intriguing mini  stories and sub plots in Naruto). The real story in Naruto is about friendship, see people, in life friends sometimes grow apart, different interests and the pressures of life take their toll and people go their separate ways, it's happened to me and i'm sure it's happened to a few of you. This happens in Naruto and my boy Naruto say's ""f**k no"" leading to a fantastic adventure to regain what has been lost, truly touching stuff here folks.
SOUND
It took me a while to realize just how big of an effect the tunes in an anime,Tv show or movie has on the overall experience, due to this i decided to take a look back over Naruto and the soundtrack it provides for a better analysis. Hot damn was i happy with it, an almost perfect selection of songs that will have you feeling tense or at ease depending on the scene as well as songs that help portray mystery and wonder when necessary. In summary the soundtrack really helps compliment the whole atmosphere of the Naruto series.
ART
A lot of people doing reviews on Naruto will probably bitch about the artwork saying it's ""patchy"" and what not. Don't listen to em folks don't do it, see what these people don't realize is the cost,time and effort it takes for these companies to hire Pro animators who basically do slave work spending days on end animating a single scene. Naruto is one of the longest running manga/anime out there so its easy to imagine costs are high. It also provides excellent action sequences and when the Naruto series calls for good animation it delivers it, when it doesn't require it, it doesn't provide it simple as peoples.
CHARACTERS
Now if there were an area in which the Naruto series falls down for me it would surly be the characters.Why you ask? well because i feel that more than one of it's large ensemble of characters are incredibly one dimensional with the main focus of character development being on our two main characters and a handful of minor characters and even with this in mind the development of said characters is incredibly slow. Also with such a large ensemble of characters more than a few pissed me off with their quirky ways (Also Sakura is one of the most useless, worthless and genuinely SHIT female protagonists i've ever seen). Now if there is a saving grace for the characters of Naruto then for me it would be the antagonists, i say this because the series crafts them Lovely backstories that allows you to understand what lead them to their wicked ways rather than the usual bullshit in anime that has an evil character who is just evil for the heck of it.
Terribly sorry about droning on here chaps so ima wrap this review up with a suggestion, don't analyze it, don't critique it and just sit back and enjoy it, if you watch it with the above in mind it's sure to be a roller coaster ride of epic fun. Peace
Much Love

                The fact that this show has an average rating below an 8 is just dreadful. This show was amazing. I went into this show thinking it would suck, and only wanted to watch it because I had no other show I could watch at the moment. 
The reason I hated Naruto so much before I saw it was because I loved Bleach and I was in that Bleach vs. Naruto argument. So no, I'm not one of those people who went into it because of hype, I had no good expectations for Naruto nor Naruto Shippuuden(still currently watching).
Watching this show has exceeded my expectations by
                  a million percent. Watching the first episode I was completely taken aback by the show. Remember, I was a big Bleach guy who had no good expectations for Naruto. However, this first episode was great. 
After that, I continued on with the story. As it progressed, my love for Naruto only grew larger. I loved the conflict that Naruto and Sasuke had with their own hidden demons. Honestly, I could relate on so many levels. And, of course, Gaara was the craziest thing ever, always love seeing him on screen.
I love the relationships that the characters build throughout the series. I specifically love the relationship between Iruka-Sensei and Naruto, despite the fact that Iruka's parents were killed the 9 tailed fox, who dwells within Naruto in the 8 pronged seal. Kakashi-Sensei's and Sasuke have a great relationship. Pervy Sage, Naruto and Granny Tsunade's relationship was amazing. Kabuto and Orochimaru were a great duo.
Even though many people dislike Sakura Haruno, I actually liked her in Naruto, although I can relate to the people who think she was pretty useless in battle. However, lets be honest; in Naruto Shippuuden she is extremely underrated and is great in that show. I can see why people don't like Sakura in the original Naruto though.
The end fight scene is pretty awesome. I won't spoil who was in it but it got me pumped up for Naruto Shippuuden. I haven't watched the infamous filler arc yet and I don't know if I ever will. 
All in all, from what I saw from Naruto I give it a perfect 10/10. I also feel the same way about Naruto: Shippuuden so far, a show that I'm getting toward the end of. After that, I will watch all the Shippuuden filler and I will begin Boruto, and yes I know that the show is quite infamous at the moment.
Final Thoughts? Both Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden are light years ahead of Bleach. I still haven't finished Bleach, and I'm still not planning to do so at the moment.",10

                Naruto is a mediocre anime but the main reason why everyone remembers it better than it actually was is because nostalgia. I'm sure plenty of old Naruto watchers used to do that stupid run and stuff like that makes people remember it more. The story is aight and same goes for the art. The soundtrack is alright as some of the sound effects are memorable,I can't say the same about it's OP and ending besides Fighting Dreamers. The characters are the usual shonen protagonist. Bullied kid,Cocky Bastard,Useless girl,A sensei to teach him shit. Naruto is the embodiment of the classic Anime protagonist. Even though it's
                  a mediocre show,I enjoy it purely based on nostalgia. If you're in your early teens,you'll probably like this but if you're in your latter teens/adults,you're gonna cringe a ton. You probably shouldn't watch this.",6

                Es una serie de aventuras ninja con muchos combates y una historia algo comun, al menos eso parece al princio con todo el rollo de los torneos y eso. Sin embargo goza de una gran cantidad de personajes perfectamente definidos, cada uno con un encanto especial y que interaccionan muy bien. La historia es sumamente dinamica y entretenida, pueden disfrutarse varios episodios seguidos sin problema, es mas, el problema sera dejar de ver la serie jeje. En mi opinion, es una de las pocas series que de verdad logra integrar una gran cantidad de personajes sin que se sienta forzada o manipulada la historia, cada
                  personaje tiene su lugar y momento de importancia. Hay escenas dramaticas, de mucha accion y algunas que hasta hacen llorar. Una de las mejores series, yo no diria que la mejor, pero si de las infantables en toda coleccion anime. Para usuarios nuevos es recomendable ver al menos 3 o 4 episodios para agarrarle el gusto e ir comprendiendo la trama, que en apariencia no es complicada, pero si que engancha con el tiempo. Tiene un cierto parecido a yuyu hakusho o dragon ball, al final de cuentas es un shonen de batallas, pero a diferencia de estas, como ya dije, goza de mucha variedad de personajes que interactuan perfecto, seguro encontraras a tu favorito muy pronto. Recomiendo verla, es una de esas series imperdibles.",9

Look this series has changed my life forever. I watched alot of smaller anime shows in the past and this was the first ever long show I ever watched. It turns out I liked long series and I have been watching short series my whole entire life. I usually do not like main characters with blonde hair but I started this series thinking that I was blonde or something I was delusional around December because it was delusional December. 
NARUTO: FIRST SERIES
------------------------------
Even though everything was good about the series the story was the best part.
                  Out of all the anime I have ever watched I was never so engaged with a series like this one. What made the plot so good was because of how long it is and to be honest even if the show was 12 episodes like most of the shows I have watched in the past it could have been great still but not as good if the story was just in 12 episodes. In the beginning the story was great but compared to the future plot it was average. It was cool seeing how the rivalry between Naruto and Sasuke started and the first couple episodes with Naruto playing around with Sasuke and Sakura was like a fun slice of life. It is so cool that all the characters from episode 1 still exist 700 episodes later in the boruto series. It is just really cool to see this. The first C mission they did was cool because you see Naruto being annyoing but super cool as well. The chunin exams to be honest were kind of the best thing I have ever watched. This anime season of Naruto was like th best even though it was realesed during 2003. Its crazy because this was made when I was born I legit was 0 years old well this was being animated even though it is weird because the manga started in 1999 this is crayz because it existed as long as spongebob. I use to think everything made before 2010 is trash but alot of old school things are cool. The chunin exam was the most smartest thing I have ever seen in the series like legit it rose my IQ. It was so funny when Naruto did not know like anything and he was just writing down nothing. Hinata and stuff was offering him questions and at this scene I got kind of pissed cause Naruto can not see that Hinata likes him its crazy. Anyway the exams in the beginning I could tell it took alot of thought. Anyway the second exam kind of reminding me of a battle royale because they are in the forest and teams are being elimanated. I was watching Naruto and this season around the time PUBG and fortnite was becoming popular. Its crazy because I thought minecraft hungergames in like 2011 than I learned about the Battle Royale Movie from like 2000's. Than this which was crazy. At the third exams when all those kids were fighting from the main characters. It really shows the personalities of the characters. Kiba vs Naruto was my third favorite fight because it was like dog vs fox because they both have animals inside of them. The hyuga clan fight was also lit as well even though Hinata loss but they got some bonding experience which I really enjoyed. The best fight was between Rock Lee and Gaara. Tbh I never really likes Gaara he reminds me of a messed up kid who has no friends. Legit I do not feel like I have empathy for this guy even over all his flashbacks. I feel like with the right personality you can make urself likeable even if you have an animals with tails. So Rock Lee when he took off those weights it legit got me fired up. Sorry about that fairytail reference. Look the Neji fight where he took revenge for Hinata when Naruto got those good speech. Legit everybody doubted Naruto. He showed his ninja way in that fight you know but I aint spoiling anything but that fight is the reason is why Naruto is Naruto. Look I had a handful of fights and though fights are not always like this. Look fights are one sided in real life but it is so cool to see fights where you see alot of comebacks. So the fight with Shikimaru look I cant say his name but that was pretty analytical and I kind of got pissed on what rank he became because of what he done because I feel like it should be someone more deserving with power. So Sasuke is really cool and was not my favorite in the beginning because I was not digging his blue shirt but later he becomes cool. In the beginning I feel like he did not know what he was doing but his Chidori was popping espically when he popped Gaaras little pimple looking barrier. Like what was he trying to finna do it was crazy. So anyway after that the fights between that puppet guy and Shino was decent not something to remember though. Anyways the training with Jiriya whats im talking bout was the funniest thing ever and how he was training for summoning or whatever. Anyways him using that in the fight with Gaara and saying how they had the same childhood or whatever was lit. To be honest I do not believe they the same. They may of had the same childhood but what about personalize wise. Naruto is cool and funny but Gaara is not. He gained his powers from birth and Naruto work hard for this also Rock Lee is lit. Bruh him training for 10 hours straight. 24/7 GRIND that is the Rock Lee way and his ninja way and he did not deserve what he got. Look Gaara thinks his life is so hard being op and whatever but no no no. Anyway lets talk about someone who does not work at all but is also lit and this is Choji. Choji has the nonstop grind on the food though. Like I love how he eats so much potato chips and ramen. Look I eat a lot of ramen and eat noodles. Kiba is lit but also I have a grudge against him because the way he talks to his dog is hella akward. I feel like this dood is a furry tbh but who cares anyway he still is lit. Neji is an okay character and reminds me of me when I was like 5 for reasons I will not tell you at all. So after the Gaara vs Naruto their was alot of filler episodes until when the gang which is Neji, Shikimarou, Choji, Kiba, and Naruto goes and tries to retrieve Sasuke from becoming evil. It was so cool seing each one of them going after a bad guy with 2x the amount of power but since they ninjas they still found away like ghost busters. So after all of these fights it made me realize their is alot more meaning to life even though I wasted alot watching Naruto. To be honest during this time I could of been spending time on so many other things but again im wasting my life and I do not even know why its crazy. I think thats it for the story and I would give it a 10 out of 10 ok.
The art was from 2003 so I guess it was okay for 2003.
The soundtrack for Naruto and openings pumped me up espically opening 2,5, and I think 8.
Enjoyment was a 10 because of the ships.
Overall a 10.",10
"
                There is  no doubt that Naruto is one of the best classic Shounen anime. The story soundtrack character development is great, and most importantly Naruto has gifted some splendid fight scenes. 
I would have given it 10 out of 10 the only reason i deducted the two stars because of those continuous meaningless fillers. Fillers which have absolute no context to the original main arc, what is the meaning of having continuously straight 30-40 episodes fillers this breaks the continuity of a show and viewers gets easily bored.
Thats all to say about Naruto.
And this one is my first review Hope you guys liked it.

                 Naruto is easily in first place in my top 10 worst/i hate animes of all times, i have never seen a anime this overrated before, the only other being gurren lagann, this series started more than an decade and there are still those fools who think it's an epic story, and unfortunately raised what is now one of the worst fanbases of all animes alongside one piece and  dragon ball, it didn't make part of my childhood lucky for me because for a lot of people it did, and unfortunately i don't even like talking about anime with those it did because i
                  can see they don't much about anime to begin with
There are many reasons why this is the anime series i hate the most, this is an list of someone who tried more than once to like this godforsaken story, but unfortunately in the end it served of nothing, the only redeemable valor is the soundtrack and a few fights, and that's it, and that cannot hold an series.
That aside let's start this rather long list
1.Main characters, the characters in naruto are the very definition of cliche, especially Sasuke, the guy is screams cliche every time a word come out of his mouth, characters in naruto are really badly developed, aside naruto and  and maybe shikamaru, gaara, hinata and itachi, all others are mostly throw in the thrash can without a decent development or even a decent fight, also, my god sakura and ino motivation, is that what they want? date an prick who treats everyone like shit and think is dark and badass?'''oh i want to kill my brother'' that's arguably one of the worst motivations in an anime, and people say Sakura and Ino are good characters, not even in hell they are, they were always terrible, no wonder as the series went on hinata started to become more and more popular, because the girl always had an objective despite liking naruto, these two became so notorious even the most die hard fans of naruto often hate especially sakura who is useless, people are tired of this princess stereotype of female characters that can't do jack shit and that's why often you see people who prefer the villains over the main characters(this includes myself).
2.Villains, the villains on the counterpart, are actually more interesting than the main characters, especially Zabuza, Haku, Orochimaru, Kimimaro, Itachi, Kisame, Kakuzu and hidan(the best duo)etc however they are just like a lot of the main characters thrown in the thrash, they have great potential but are poorly used and are defeated by some of the most outrageous plot armor in an anime ever, especially Kimimaro, which had big potential, this same feat will repeat in shippuden with characters like, sasori, deidara, kakuzu and hidan(my two favorites), the entire akatsuki, they could have been the main characters not the villains easily since they are leagues more interesting than the main characters, hell imagine how cool would it be if konan was the main ''heroine'' instead of generic and boring character that sakura is?
3. World/Lore, the world in naruto was never well explored or well used, there are other villages but in the end is all about konoha, clichemoto tries to make the series have an deeper world and lore and etc, but he fails every time because he doesn't know what to do with it, the characters only mention other places and villages, but its never shown, and to tell the truth the other villages from what is commented are a lot more interesting, but mostly pointless, the only interesting thing on its lore is the bijuu like kurama/kyuubi and shukaku and a few others that appear on shippuden, and that's it, it doesn't explore beyond that, and even that he finds and way to screw it up by making bijuus except kyuubi useless for the most part except awaking the 10 tails.
4.Bad logics and plot armor, ever since naruto started, it was clear clichemoto doesn't know how to make character power levels, because it makes no fucking sense, and kid who trained idk for like only months be able to beat and war veteran and born to battle enemies who knows a lot more about fighting and still loses, this is ridiculous, this is an example of bad logic and use of plot armor, and this happens from starts to finish and it manages to become worse in naruto shippuden where the restrictions are thrown in the garbage and everyone starts to become chakra gods.
5.The animation, well the naruto animation always had an bad legacy, it has a lot of flaws and just plain errors that can be noticed if you pause while watching, some even say not to pause naruto while watching if you want to avoid it, the worst part, is because there are other animes from pierrot like bleach, and bleach has nowhere near the same problem naruto had, which makes you question why the fuck it's animations are bad for the most part and feel cheap, there are other animes from that same decade that don't look as cheap as naruto, and don't think the manga is way better because clichemoto is not that good in drawing, occasionally rising above average but not that much
6.Soundtrack, the soundtrack in the series is perhaps one of the few solid points of it, it has soundtracks that unfortunately marked an generation, but aren't necessarily good nor bad, it only served more to please the naruto fanboys so they can keep living in their forever nostalgia, sure there good soundtracks, but i would say there are better ones out there, hell bleach has an even better soundtrack, shiro sagisou did an better job in bleach compared to naruto soundtrack, also the openings, well the only one i consider good is the last opening, which is not an j-rock opening we have seen a million times, it also demonstrates martial arts better than the anime, and unfortunately almost all of the other openings are j-rocks that are nostalgia driven, and aren't really that good, also fuck you asian kung fu generation for making one of the most overrated openings in the planet that relies on nostalgia, also known as haruka kanata
7. Fillers, naruto is already notorious along with bleach and even one piece for it's fillers, it's one of the reasons a lot of people(like me) hate the series, the fillers really made the quantity of episodes bigger than it should, naruto shippuden ended with 500 episodes thanks to it's god forsaken fillers, and classic naruto is no different, the series were stretched out thanks to them, and that's not a good thing, plainly made for greedy reasons to keep the money flowing and also give time for clichemoto to create more cliche chapters.
8. Story, the story in naruto can be noticed to be very scripted and filled with some of the most boring cliches ever, this is why when the fourth ninja war happened and it went downhill and consequently screwed naruto reputation(for me a good thing, finally people woke the fuck up that it has never been this amazing story to begin with), because the story revolves on the same classic idea of good x evil, sometimes trying to blur the lines of good and evil along with a bit of philosophy, but it doesn't hold up it's cliches nor it saves, it just makes you crave when something new happens, only to be filled with cliches again and again as if they were new and ''good'', and people use naruto story as an compare meter to other animes, which is pathetic, this story has never been that good to begin with, starts slow and weak, gains a bit of strength, goes downhill, it's not like bleach and one piece, were bleach starts really strong, one of the best shounens starts ever and then loses a bit of steam but manages to get back, or one piece where it starts really weak but then BOOM especially in the alabasta and marine ford arc, also this is another problem, there is no marine ford arc level on naruto, which just shows how clichemoto doesn't know what to do sometimes
This is perhaps naruto biggest flaw, some of you will agree others might just  some insane logic to try justify it, but it's still an flaw, and it never got better in the series, especially in the fillers, and it's one of the reasons i hate naruto because it shits on this pre-idealized idea for some generic designs and the final and biggest flaw is..
9.The characters don't fucking LOOK LIKE NINJAS TO BEGIN WITH, This is pretty much an flaw of naruto that breaks immersion and makes you see the characters as anything else like monks, mages etc anything but ninjas, clichemoto character designs for the most part sucks, and it shits on the idea of ninjas, you know stealth oriented warriors that are completely in black, and are deadly and kill without hesitation, which is something 90% of the characters lack, the only two characters in this entire fucking series that look like an ninja and act like an ninja or close to it, is Kakuzu and Haku, BOTH WERE SO BADLY USED AND DEFEATED BY PLOT ARMOR THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS, WHY THE ONLY FUCKING 2 CHARACTERS THAT LOOK LIKE NINJA IN THE SERIES, WERE THROWN IN THE GARBAGE, WHILE CHARACTERS LIKE NARUTO HIMSELF,KIBA, INO, SAKURA, SASUKE, CHOUJI, TENTEN, ROCK LEE, KANKURU, TEMARI,KONOHAMARU AND HIS FRIENDS, SHIKAMARU, GAARA ETC DON'T LOOK LIKE NINJAS ARE STILL IN THE SERIES, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, NO STUPID THEORY OR JACK SHIT WILL JUSTIFY THIS, NARUTO IS THE WORST THING TO HAVE EVER HAPPEN TO CONCEPT OF NINJAS  AND IT ALSO MANAGED TO DETURPATE IT, WHY THE FUCK PEOPLE TURN AN BLIND EYE TO IT? ''oh but is clichemoto interpretation of ninjas'' NO ONE ASKED FOR HIS INTERPRETATION OF NINJAS, THE GUY NEVER HAD AN CLUE OF WHAT AN NINJA LOOKS LIKE FROM IT'S HINTED ON HIS CHARACTERS DESIGNS AND HE SUCKS, IF YOU COMPARE TO D-GRAY MAN CHARACTER DESIGNS, NARUTO IS ANEMIC ON THAT ASPECT.
And perhaps this is it, all the reasons why this series sucks and is overrated, it's an series that has finally fucking finished,(at least until boruto shows up ZzZzZz) being stretched up to 500 episodes thanks to its fillers, and perhaps something better will come to take it's place, from which i deeply hope, this series is an testament of how people let their nostalgia a lot of time speak bigger and ignore flaws, flaws from which made naruto lose a lot of popularity especially in the future fourth ninja war, like i said i tried more than once to like it, but i's like banging my head against the wall for something not worthwhile, i hope clichemoto(yes i call him this way after my friend called him that) at least learn something from all of his mistakes, and please god stay away from any other ethnic group and don't try to deturpate it, this review is huge but i wanted to stay clear all the reasons, not just some empty hater who just hates it because it's popular, no i hate it because it was never that great to begin with, only have popularity, thank you and have a nice day watching better animes.",3

                Despite what many people may lead you to believe, Naruto is not devoid of good qualities. It's the butt of a lot of jokes and would generally be considered the worst of the ""Big Three"" and this definitely isn't without reason, but it does have its strengths. (Also as a heads up, I watched the fan-made ""Naruto Kai"" cut of the show that removes the filler arcs and runs parallel to the manga.)
Its main strength, in my opinion, is that it's immediately understandable and relatable. All of the character's motivations and characterizations are very quickly explained or picked up on, and anyone can understand them
                  because of how simple they all are. This, along with extremely likable and memorable character designs, makes getting invested in the characters and story very very easy despite the show's many shortcomings, and it's likely why many people have become so attached to these characters. The show does a good job of bringing the viewer into its world and getting them excited to learn all about it and its many complexities, as it is an entirely original universe. The soundtrack is also noticeably good if not a bit repetitive, and this helps some of the more boring stretches of the show feel more exciting. But this is all that I can really say good about the show. I have plenty of problems with the show like the lazy animation, and the obnoxious voice acing, but there's really only one or two things that really kill it for me, and the first is the terrible character writing. 
The character's personalities wear thin almost immediately, as Kishimoto shows absolutely no prowess in writing or developing complex characters. You could say that for a battle series of this nature, having multi-dimensional or complex characters isn't a necessity, and this would be true if it had a brain-dead simple plot like Dragonball Z, but when the story attempts to be more complex like it does in Naruto, the characters don't get the development they need, and the whole experience falls flat. 
Why does Naruto want to be the Hokage? Well it's mostly because he feels insecure about how hated he is, and wants to be respected, but even after he builds a group of friends and a circle of people who love and support him, he still never even once questions his motivations. Why does he want to get Sasuke to come back to Konohagakure? Obviously it's because they're friends, but are they really? Over the course of the show they've shown almost nothing but contempt for one another, and Sasuke is acting 100% on his own volition, but Naruto keeps coming back like a confused ex asking for a second chance. All of this would be fine, if he ever ever even once stopped to consider if this was a good idea in the first place, because when he doesn't it makes him an entirely unbelievable character. 
These aren't huge gaping plot holes or anything like that, but when every single character's actions very often leave me scratching my head and asking these types of questions, at some point I can't put up with it anymore, it makes me lose interest in the goals of the characters because I've become alienated to their importance or validity. The show also has no way of telling the audience about its characters or developing them other than long flashbacks of their childhood with narration explaining how it affected the character, and when the show does absolutely all of the work for you when it comes to understanding the characters, I lose interest immediately. 
My second main issue is the godawful pacing. While the character writing dampens the impact of the show long term, the pacing destroys the enjoyment on a moment-to-moment basis. The show moves at an absolutely molasses pace, spending episode after episode after episode on the same fight, where after every single beat we have to stop and show every character's reactions, the combatants have to talk to one another which leads into a long flashback scene explaining something about the characters, some establishing shots, and then we can start the actual fight again. This slow drawn out pacing plagues the entire show, and is particularly awful in the third Chunin Exam, and I can only imagine how much worse the pacing would be on a macro-scale had I not skipped the filler.
Overall, Naruto is a show with a lot of endearing pieces that just cannot bring itself to put them together in a satisfying way, and while on a moment to moment basis it's not the worst thing in the world and is often even enjoyable, as a whole experience it leaves me feeling absolutely hollow and dead inside.

                I GOT BAD GRAMMAR SKILLS (don't make it a big deal if you see errors)
To all of the people that have been hounding about how Naruto is so very mainstream , well maybe you should remember the reason why it is in the first place? 
The character is an underdog a true underdog with no chance at all in the beginning of the anime and we all know that. But the story is more about how each character has developed not only physically but emotionally and mentally as well. Sure Naruto has its cliches, but guess what?  So does so many other animes out
                  there. Its okay if it has some cliches, cause the plot and character development and excellent , but to say that Naruto is okay or just good really doesn't say much if you have been watching it for as many years as I have. The fillers are ridiculous, yes we all know and it pisses so many of us off, but the completely discredit the work and thought that was put into each character (except TenTen, Shino and Iruka) is dissapointing. If I could give Naruto an 8.7 I would cause I know thats a fair score.",8
"
                I think the show is a blast to watch. It has interesting characters, except Sakura. The characters are mostly developed and have some humane aspects towards them if you consider the world that they reside in. It has a lot of filler, but what can you expect from the genre, devs have to earn a living. 
Naruto tries his hardest to improve. Sasuke goes about his revenge a normal pre-teen would considering the world they live in, his childhood and the trauma he faced. Sakura, well is Sakura as she has only one interest, which is strange considering her age, but what can you expect
                  she lives in a fantasy world that has a different moral standards to ours (doesn't explain her uselessness). Kakashi is a useful character as he helps to explain a lot of the logic to the viewers and acts as the glue for team 7 as well as being a badarse (I'm British this is how I spell badass).",7
"
                I just got into Anime a couple years ago. My most favorite will always be Naruto/Naruto Shippuuden. It's the only anime so far that has gotten me to cry a lot. I feel all the things that the characters are going through. It's about friendship,family,pride of where you come from. This show makes me laugh,makes me cry, I've even yelled at my computer screen when things happen I don't like. lol. I never came across any show like Naruto that had me fall completely in love with it. I do admit when I heard of this show I thought it was just for kids. That
                  it was going to be this lame kid show. Boy was I wrong! My sister actually got me into anime and introduced me to Naruto. I'm so glad she did! I thank her like everyday. I love everything about Naruto. The storyline,the characters,music,animation. EVERYTHING!!. Naruto is always in my heart. Hands down the best anime! This is my opinion though. People have others that they love more or what they think is the best ever. I've told some other anime fans that Naruto was my most fav and they would laugh. Doesn't bother me any because it's what I like not what they like.",10
"
                Okay Okay Okay.
Naruto is a great series to watch... If you have no job and have a few spare hours to fill.
It has enough to be mildly entertaining.
I have a few annoyances with this series though.
Characters:
Usually naruto and sakura; They both tend to do things in the middle of a fight that make you want to cringe at.Sakura just sits in fear, hardly has a decent fight scene. Is really boring to watch. HELL!! It annoys me when she constantly bags Naruto for being useless and you feel like screaming ""WELL WHY DONT YOU GET OFF YOUR ASS THEN SAKURA!!""
Naruto: I enjoy humour, but this kids a little brat. He just complains and gets in the way all the time. Its like that annoying smelly 5yro cousin the constantly gets his face in the way when you are ready a book. Or who sits and asks a million questions when you are playing video games... annoying is an understatement. 
Also, when it comes to the fight scenes. I get extremely annoyed at sequences where the main hero powers up to his highest levels AND STILL GETS THE SHIT KICKED OUT OF THEM! You get all excited, only to be very disappointed. I might add Dragonball Z has this problem time and time again.
Plus the fight plots arent very creative. it starts off easy, then the enemy has hidden potential. someone comes in and saves the day.... BEARLY!! 
There arent any moments when you are proud of the characters triumphs. By the time it ends you are left thinking ""well its about time!""
Also, I dislike the lack of variety in the fighting. They seem to forever repeat the same attack again and again. No new moves. No combos. Nothing that makes the next boss fight amazing!
Coming back to things characters do that are just flatout stupid. You think ""that was obvious!! how did you not notice! you are a freaking ninja!!!"" Im not saying they need to be godly powerful, but its not clever stuff that gets them.
ALSO IM SICK OF THE REPLACEMENT JUTSU! the one where they trap the guy and they turn out to be a log or something. WAY WAY OVER USED!!!
I might just add, that Gurren Lagaan has none of this and is still amazing. The fighting is impressive and gets.to.the.point. when they power up, you know its gunna get brutal! and it does!
Even when Rock Lee uses his 'Forbidden' jutsu, its amazing!!! But it doesnt even amount to the finishing move. He still loses and it kinda feels like it was pointless to even try.
I like my Movies, anime etc to get to the point and stay on track.
Like Dragon Ball; naruto is fine to watch with a spare moment. But its so repetative in ideas, it feels like ""same shit different story""
THE END",5
"
                If Naruto was a recent anime, it would have received a much lower rating than a 7/10. But since it is one of the early shounen, I am overlooking many of the typical shounen elements. I am also judging the series solely based on the official episodes and not the useless, boring fillers that no one watches.
Naruto is definitely an iconic series. Everyone knows Naruto run. It is a gate opener for many viewers  to enter the world of anime. And it is popular for a reason. The premise is interesting enough. Ninjas with creative jutsus and complex battle stragies fighting each other? Count
                  me in. 
Sadly, Naruto squanders its interesting its premise with boring character development and many, many useless fillers. 
Story: 6/10. As previously mentioned, Naruto is based on an interesting premise with so much potential. Sure, the story is typical shounen, but when I watched it, the shounen world wasn't yet filled with such a storyline yet. However, the story fails to explore any deep philosophy and only ever scratches the surface. It attempts to tackle the question of nurture vs nature, with Naruto being the epitome of ""work hard and you can succeed"" slogan, but this attempt collapses on itself as Naruto is the most privileged character in the whole series. He is stupid and lazy, but dreams big because he wants the attention of the village. However, thanks to the nine-tailed fox power nested within, he is gifted with tremendous chakra that allows him to sucker punch anyway and heal in minutes. He doesn't need to train particularly hard. Whenever things get rough, he just borrows the fox's power, and the problem is solved.
Another big problem is plot convenience, which is a perennial problem for shounens. The Replacement jutsu is never explained clearly in the manga, and basically just serves to save a character's ass when needed.
However, the story is still able to keep viewers entertained with creative jutsus and strategies. Chunin Exam is arguably the greatest tournament arc I've ever seen in a shounen anime. It is well thought out, and introduces the characters' background nicely. It also sets the foundation for many characters' development. I cannot praise this arc enough. 
But then, the foundation for character development just lays there to rot, which I will get back on Character section. 
Art: to be honest, it should only deserve a 7/10 due to its inconsistency, but given the time that it was made, I give it a 9/10.
Sound: 9/10 Awesome soundtrack
Character: 5/10. Naruto first grows on you. He's steadfast in his belief. He wants to always be there for his friends. He goes against the ninja rulebook to rescue his comrades because that's his ninja way. He stands up when he falls. 
But as the series progresses, he turns you off because he's so one-dimensional that even a number line is jealous. He's never put in any moral test. He's naive to a fault. You will also realize he's a hypocrite for preaching about hard work but never actually puts in any work. He mostly wins using his talk no jutsu, which is basically just slap some preaching into the opponent until he is moved to the point of giving up. 
Meanwhile, Sasuke, who is a copycat of Kurapika, has a lot of potential. Determined to revenge his clan, he is torn between vengeance and his comrades. Sasuke in this season is probably one of the most developed characters
The villains are quite interesting: Zaku, Gaara and Orochimaru are all fascinating and have good development. 
However, the female characters are SO SO bad. Sakura is the most useless character you'll ever see on screen. You can only find 2 female characters that have any screen time to shine. The rest are one-dimensional and only care about boys. 
Enjoyment: The fights are really good, and minus the fillers, the story and pacing are all good. 7/10
Overall : (barely) 7/10. I'm being really generous here and not take into consideration the fillers.",7

                Note: This review was written on my Review Book on Wattpad. If you are interested, don't be shy to check it out! (Link's in my bio)
Ok, so if you guys don't know, Naruto is an action/martial arts/shounen anime, with a second season called Naruto Shippuden. Even though the manga was completed, the author, Masashi Kishimoto, has created a second series, or rather, a next generation, called Boruto. Though I haven't read any of that series what-so-ever, this review will be only on tt revolves around the series that revolves around Naruto. 
I was first introduced into anime becuase of Naruto, and I started picking up
                  the manga at my library. I finished the manga in about a year, with every-other week trips to the library,  and I pretty much enjoyed it. Later on, I started watching the anime, and the rest is history. Sometimes I'll look at some things fan-made for the series, but I dont look into it that much anymore. 
WARNING! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!
Story: 8/10
Naruto's story is pretty straight-forward: a child with spiky blond hair was hated and disliked because he had a demon stuck inside him. But as he developed to be a better ninja, he learned more about his lost parents, the demon deep inside him, and how to control the power that he was given. And even though everyone hated him (except for his stalker- I mean fellow ninja who crushed on him, Hinata, his rival, Rock Lee, and every last one of his senseis), Naruto had faith in everyone, and loved them all like family. Even when Sasuke had changed sides, and joined the Akatsuki, Nauto still believed in him, and cared about him unlike everyone (Maybe not like Sakura but...) . 
I decided to give the story in this anime an 8, because this anime does have potential, it really does, it's just the series is pretty much over-hyped. When I got into the series, I had high hopes that it was good as the fans of the series had said. Sure, I tolerated through the whole thing, and I'm not saying it's a bad series, just over-hyped. There's also a lot of dragged out parts that shouldn't have, especially the fighting scenes. Fights took several episodes, even though they could've been covered in one or two. Generally, I feel as if the story is pretty good over-all, but it's not a masterpiece like most people say it is. 
Art: 7/10
Ok, so yes, I like some of the outfit designs given to certain characters (Ex: Kiba, Deidara, Hinata, etc.,), but others were, no offense, but really werent smart (*cough cough* Choji *chough cough*). I mean, when you give a character a bage to wear on their head like a pair of fricken panties, and you thought that was a good idea? I'm sorry but you have problems. Also, there were many flaws and errors in the graphic designs that are unforgettable, like some of the graphics with Pain. Yes, some of the results can be funny, like pausing Lost Pause or something, but I mean sometimes you'd see flaws in the animation without pausing. I feel as if I've seen better art and animation styles in later animes that I've seen. 
Sound: 8/10
The soundtrack to this series is probably one of the most memorable parts to the series, especially some of the more sadder things, like Gaara's backstory. Though some of the fight themes could've deserved better themes, and the tribal-voice song thing wasn't as good either, but I'm deciding to give the soundtrack an 8, because most of it I enjoyed, and openings werent that bad either. 
Characters: 7/10
The characters in Naruto have good and bad to them. I love how each character has a dream that is related to their backstory, and how some characters can relate to another in some way (Ex: Gaara and Naruto have been hated for the demons they posses inside them). But what I really don't like is Naruto's stupidity. And the fact that they stereotype women as if they can't do anything. 
Like seriously, first off, Naruto's stupidity isn't that silly, goofy-cute stupidity, like Nichijou is, it's just really annoying and immature stupidity, like after a while i was just like ""Okay Naruto, thats enough. Just fucking stop."" 
Another thing: Girls are stereotyped as useless in this anime. Sure, I really dislike Sakura, but every time she or any other female character tries to make a difference in the show, the spotlight and glory is shined on Naruto and his male buddies. I mean, come on! If you don't want the women to do anything in the show then don't put them there! For example, there was like one guy in Magica Madoka, and he didn't really make a difference in the show, so the creators didn't use him that much. And that makes sense. But please, if you're going to create a bunch of ""Main Characters"" that arent going to do anything at all besides waste space, then dont add them at all. So, in conclusion, because even though we have some problems that include stereotyping and personality traits in some protaginists, I decided to give this section of my review an 7/10.
Enjoyment/General: 6/10
Seeing this was the very first anime I had ever watched, I thought that it was pretty good. But, for some reason, when I go back to it, I feel as if the series was a bit overhyped, and after I finished Naruto, there were other animes that I just enjoyed a lot more than Naruto. Yes, it was a good anime to start out with three years ago for me, but as I had more internet advantages, I had the chance to branch out my variety in anime and manga, and I found a ton of better animes. And for some reason I seem to enjoy the less likely animes rather than the ones that everyone talks about. So in general, I'd give Naruto a 6, a 5 at the least. It wasn't one of my personal favorites, but I'm pretty sure there are plenty of crappy animes to move it up the list.",6
"
                Finally picked this up after all my friends where whining about how awesome this is. Sorely disappointed. The main character is a loudmouth and I thought ninjas were supposed to be cool, not stupid 11 year old boys who make more noise than anything. The art is fine except the noses. These guys don't know how to draw noses. I suppose there are worse things than this to watch, but as it stands, it's barely above mediocore.

                Hi guys im back.Now with Naruto.
Story,so i realy dont need to talk that much about this anime but ill try becouse i think about 80% anime lovers watched this anime and maybe watched Shippuden  or are still watching,but a nice story of friendship of Sasuke and Naruto (mostly them but also Sakura),everyone knows the story but i personaly liked it.
Art,for an 2002 anime it has realy nice art,those jutsus and that special moves are realy good looking the same means for the characters.
Sound,well i like the battle music,and overall the music is great,and the voices are awsomely done (acept the dub that vas awful,for
                  me atleast).
Character,this anime has an nice number of characters from Genin to ANBU,theyr art is awsome,individual storys are cool.
Enjoyment,it vas an good anime but i kinda didnt have a big naruto fan inside me and im not one now,but i liked this anime mostly becouse of the music but the plot is cool.
Overall,the anime has an great plot,nice art,awsome music,nice number of characters,so this is an realy nice anime.You say anime to someone (a non anime lover) the first thing that comes to his mind is Naruto.This anime everyone knows and watched it as a kid or as an teen.
Thx for reading,sorry for any typos that i made (mistakes in typing),im sorry that im doing that much reviews all of asuden but i want to do an review to every or atleast to most of the anime i watched or im watching.",9

                Naruto is one of those anime's that you just have to watch to just get a full experience of anime in general.  Now as I and many other will agree naruto is absolute horrible compared to shipuden its perfect.  It's one of those cliche ridden stories thats just a blast to watch.  The fights are great and fluid.  The art is amazing.  The story is generic underdog and its perfectly enjoyable and a blast to watch in every way shape and form.  Naruto is a loud obnoxious brat, sasuke is an edgy teen, and sakura is literally the most
                  useless person ever.  But its hard not to enjoy because its so well done.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone starting to watch.  This was the first anime I ever watched and i always have a blast picking up and re watching episodes.",9

                just keep training just keep training haha.
      Story: now Naruto is very well known for having the most filler than any other anime out  and shippuden is just as bad but yet is still one of the greatest Shonen story ever told meh it bit of a stretch I mean I have seen been one however I enjoy as a whole it very engaging and story driven and feels like on journey through there life watching them as they grow which is what I fine is an amazing aspect of the series including shippuden but to talk about the
                  original story here of Naruto . my favorites would have to be the chunin exam because you just how amazing the fight scene are and the story
        character: i love the character as simple as that they are all divrse and unique to one another  and i like how they show off there stregnht and what they fight for and the passion they put inot and can't happen but get attach to the character. 
                    Naruto is down right amazing and the sheer will of never giving even when he knows he can't win but tends to divide the odds and i have to honestly naruto traing progress is better then dragon in terms of time and progress as well as number of fail aempt to finally succeed at a technique. sakura i ll be brief and honestly i don't really like here in there i thought she was annoying and one of the mosr useless character in terms of battle she maybe smart but she just not a liable character however i like here in shippuden infact i really like and grew more attach to her so es she does get better and her personality has change for the better. sasuke well he a grade A |@sshole plain and simple no regard for friends or family or anyone for that matter however i respect that fact that sasuke did respect naruto in his own way. the one more person i just want to mention just how cute is Hinata i mean she freakin adorable in term of being shy and all and just and FYI  she a bad@ass in shippuden so just watch her haha.
       ART/SOUND the art is deffinitly unqiue and different compare to other standard anime series now i don't usely do my homework and see how the studio draw there character but if i didn't know any better they like painted where i bet is not easy to do so prompt for the  and as for the sound quality is awesome like i love that each fight scene the character has there own action music i tput on a personal level and th eOP the change often through the series and just wow amazing music choice including the outro 
      Overall: i know many you ar ethinnking i sound like i love this series and trust i do but it not engouh to make it a masterpiece rating because there are a few thing that i myself have problem with and one of them happen to be filller which i think everyone is the same way i don't mind it ot a point but is there like 20 or 100 episode of straight filler the put away fromt he main story can't be pretty annoying and you just want to know what happens next but like i said  some filler are pretty good and they can be enjoyable the other thing i didn't like between epsiode when there no action or not trainging going there a lengthly period of monlogue and that can get boring after while however the the story is still good wither way and one mor ethng i'm not really a fan of flashback episode i'm mor eabout the present so it does't matter what happen back then what matter is what happen in the future. now ith the being said i do watch the falshback anyways just to ge tth efeel of the story and they are some good one  but mostly nothing really special however the shipuden flashback are really good like i had no idea how good it was  so ya by me saying this shippuden is way better than this for sure however i would recomend to watch the naruto and grow with the character because trust it worth when you head of to shippuden after seeing and there gonna be tears like you had no idea so if you can put in the time then do it watch it and you just might fell in love with it if not maybe it wasn't ment for you.",8

                The synopsis describes the show well. My take: Naruto is a very good anime to watch with one condition. Find a list of filler episodes and consequently skip them when watching the series. Thank me later.
Otherwise, prepare to explore a ninja world far-removed from the typical black-clad ninja the west has come to know. This story follows the exploits of the show's namesake, Naruto, and his simple but atypical approach to life as a ninja. Along the way you will be introduced to a memorable and quirky cast of characters, such as fellow ninja student and Naruto's love interest, Sakura, his cold-blooded rival Sasuke, and
                  their enigmatically awesome teacher Kakeshi.
The animation for the show is decent, the story is intriguing, and the music is very memorable. 8/10.",8

                Naruto is exactly the epitome of what's wrong with shounen anime/manga the same way Bleach and Dragon Ball were flawed. YES I realize these three anime, however flaws they may have, are iconic and staple mainstream anime... but if you stopped to think about the story REALLY, they're not very good.
Naruto starts off strong and likable as a series altogether. The show however uses a bad trope that ruins most shounen stories; escalation and one upping the previous arc with a stronger enemy. And the protagonist becoming stronger by rinse/repeating what they did previous arcs is how they show character growth? So dumb. 
I know
                  most people complain about fillers but I don't even need to. Even without the fillers, this anime gets it so horribly wrong. By the end, they lost sight of what this anime was even about in the beginning. Sure he wants to be Hokage but honestly that's so vague and general in the grand scheme of things going around our character. Also how this anime holds your hands like a baby? Do we really need a flashback to the last episode 3 times in one episode?
Naruto is trash; there's a lot to like about Naruto but ultimately it isn't very good. If you MUST know what happens in Naruto, just read the manga so you won't at least waste your time. This show is so cringe worthy too; like if a giant monster is attacking you and you just took a fatal blow to save someone, you're going to die or the monster will go after you. It's not going to let you sit there and allow for a crying sappy 10 minute scene.
Stay far away from Naruto. Go watch Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. It's actually a good shounen and holds up well. Also, shows like FMA does NOT use the terrible ""escalation"" trope where the character's growth and journey is parallel to their growth of strength/power like some bad Dragon Ball fanfic.",4

                Story (Mediocre = 5)
Character (Mediocre = 5)
Enjoyment (Fair = 6)
OK, for the Story, Character, and Enjoyment segment, I'll write it down together as one review because they're link closely to each other.
- The titular character = Naruto has characters that are the most easy for us to fall in love with. He is cheerful and happy character, pure at heart because he's naive, too naive even, that he is very close to stupidity, but he has a very strong determination, values friendship and loyalty, and will do anything for friendship and loyalty.
- PLUS, he has a very touching background that we want to shed our
                  tears upon his lonely, sad, and hard past.
- But that's not all, almost ALL of the characters inside this series are filled with background stories.
- Some of them are sad and endearing background story, some of them provide a strong bond of friendship turned into rival, and some are spiced up with the little emotional background stories ingredient here and there, etc.
- Naruto's character is lovable, and almost everybody has been provided with a deep background story, with a little bit of touchy ingredients here and there, so why only a mediocre score for characters and story?
- Here's the explanation.
- The main protagonist of this series suppose to be Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke, and Kakashi.
- But Sakura rarely ""throw a punch"", and Sakura doesn't really have anything MAJOR role within the team. In other words, Sakura doesn't do much for and in the team. In other words, why should Sakura be the main protagonist if her role is really-really-really MINOR.
- Meanwhile the other characters, although they are provided with a deep and touchy background stories, I could consider them as being ""too much to include many things"".
- Why? Because the series put too much characters, but in the end, not all of them made a handfull of active role within the entire story.
- The good example is Ten Ten. They are supposed to be the supporting characters, fine I get it, supporting characters doesn't supposed to have any heavy role in the series.
- But again, just like Sakura, Ten Ten rarely ""throws a punch"", she rarely fight, she only involves actively in the ""Chunin Exam Arc"", and afterwards, she just appears as a very-very-very insignificant and minor role.
- In other words, if Ten Ten is supposed to be that insignificant and very minor role, why should be a character named Ten Ten in the first place? Seriously, her purpose is nothing but an accessories and nothing more. And accessories doesn't really have any weight and depth to the entire series.
- And Ten Ten is not the only one, we have  A LOT more of the other characters that also have insignificant, minor, not heavy, and not have any depth role.
- That's why in the character department, the series put too much character that doesn't really need to be there because they do not have enough depth and weight in their role in the story.
- Now the story and enjoyment, again, it drops to the mediocre and fair score.
- The explanation is, eventhough the series provide a strong background to almost ALL of the characters, but they inserted the story in a very bad timing - which is during a fight.
- The flow of the fight goes like this: fight - pause for a flashback to describe the background story - fight - pause to discuss technical analysis, and so on.
- You see the flow, during the fight, our mood is ""Excitement"", but our ""Excitement"" is being thrown by a ""wet blanket"" because during the fight, there is this ""pause for a flashback to describe the background story"". It drops the mood-o'-meter greatly from the heights of ""Excitement"" into a flat or sad mood during the background story.
- Not to mention about the ""pause to discuss technical analysis"" during the fight. That is also droping the mood-o'-meter just like the ""pause for a flashback to describe the background story"", with also the same explanation as described earlier.
- Now then, not only those PAUSES destroy our mood-o'-meter, but it also damage the story pacing into a very sloooooooooooooow pace.
- For example, Naruto and Sasuke's final battle consumes (I have counted the series) 8 episodes.
- I said OMG! 8 episodes to wrap up a duel? what's making it so long? the answer is nothing less then the one I described earlier: ""fight - pause for a flashback to describe background story - fight - pause to discuss technical analysis"".
- Not only that, as the story progressed, the fight lost its soul as a ""Ninja"".
- Why? Because as the story progressed, it's getting more and more about ""fighting using magic"". It's getting less and less using a martial art ninja fighting, and it's using more and more magic and magic.
- And with that trade off between Ninja martial arts fighting and magic, the series getting more and more lost its ""Ninja"" soul.
- More negative part of the story is some part (even not the filler part) of the story doesn't really matter to the main chain of the story.
- Many times there are episodes just to show what a goofball Naruto is. And that took 1 entire episode to show that? That's wasteful.
- And some arc, like Naruto's team mission to escort that ""Marathon"" guy really isn't necessary. The weight of the story to the remaining arc and to the rest of the story chain doesn't really significant.
- So insignificant that you won't miss a thing if you just SKIP the arc.
- And that ""Marathon"" escort arc is just one of many stories that is insignificant, but waste of number of episodes in this series.
- The other most wasteful insignificant story is the filler arc.
- The filler arc, if I count the number of episodes, it consumes 86 episodes of filler.
- Filler never have any significant weight to the main story chain, never did, never is, never will.
- But wasting 86 episodes on something insignificant weight to the main story chain on filler is just plain wasteful.
- The pacing of the story is incredibly sloooooooow, the mood-o'-meter drops from ""Excitement"" many times, and as the story progressed, the ""Ninja"" atmosphere begins to fade and fade, many wasteful episodes, even for the non-filler, I can not grade Naruto into a higher score than 5 and 6.
- Because it is very mediocre and I think Naruto is far much too overrated and overhyped.
Sound (Good = 7)
- Sound is good, because much of the Opening and Ending theme are enthusiastic.
- The BGM is also enthusiastic.
- But then again, not all of them are match the mood of the scene, so I'll consider it good, but not ""very"" good.
Art (Art = 6)
- Well, it just plain descent graphic to me.
So Overall = (5+6+7+5+6) : 5 = 6 (round up)",6

                I find the storyline intelligently insulting, 
I don't want to just write a bad review but I have given this a lot of thinking and can't convince myself to give it a good review; 
Yes, it's enjoyable but the repetition and the lazy story just ruin the experience. 
the concept is very promising in a way it reminds me of HxH however they are not even comparable if you have watched a lot of animes you better save your time for other series but if you are just starting and you find the concept kind of cool just watch it don't care about this review.

                So this show is 217 episodes long and is a shonen. That means it's going to have filler. That's expected. But how much? 20 episodes? Nope. 30 episodes? Not even close. 50? You're getting warmer but still far off. 70 is can't be higher than that, the shows only 217 episodes. Wrong! 92 episodes?!?! DING DING DING WE HAVE A WINNER!!!! 92 episodes of noncanon filler episodes. That just about sets the record for the most filler with one of the big three shonen shows clocking in at 42.396% of the episodes never actually happening in the manga
Now that's out of the way let me
                  tell you how to fix it skip the episode wear the gang tries to find what's under kakashi's mask (or don't it's one of the few good filler episodes), skip dumb triathlon arc, and then skip to shippuuden after episode 135 at the end of that arc. If you can't remember that just watch the show and stop after the noticeable drop in quality with everything to arc structure to character designs gets to you too bad
TLDR: 92 fillers are 42% of the show but 85 of those are the back half of the series and only 7 are in between the canon arcs so it's not that bad and avoidable",6

                I was 11 years old when i first started watching Naruto. I originally started watching it hesitantly because i thought anime was stupid but the minute I watched it I was like okay episode 1 was okay, episode 2 was a little bit better and so on so forth. My only problem really with the original Naruto is the Art and Sound but that mainly has to do with the how old the show was and what I was used to as a kid growing up in the 2010's. The story is original and I can sympathize with anyone who had to wait two long
                  years for the Sequel. If you really like shows that have to do with massive character development Naruto is for you. Plus the music is pretty good. Anybody with time should definitely watch Naruto.",10
"
                When I was younger, this was a great anime to watch. But now that I've seen ones like Black Butler, Trinity Blood, even the Animatrix, I realize just how wrong I was. I think that once you get older and start watching shows that are less filler and more story line, you have less patience for long series that has half actual plot and story line and the other half filler and flashbacks of what happened 3 episodes ago.
              ",6
"
                The Character Development and Storyline of Naruto contributes to showing a more complex and meaningful world. If you look beyond the surface of your emotions about the characters, you will realize how Naruto and people in his life grow in the Anime. 
I watch Anime for the storyline, relationships (Protagonists and Supporting Roles + Antagonists, Etc), and themes that I can relate with. From this angle, Naruto provides a holistic elements of this universe. 
It can actually reflect the real world's historical events throughout all nations. 
Give this Anime a chance. It's okay to critique it, but it's foolish to try to berate this show.
                  It's just a show. You learn from Anime, Manga, Novels, etc. :)",9
"
                Rarely do we come across such a successful mixture of fun , thrill , motivation , drama , humour and which leaves an impact .
The animation quality is good and it revolves around the brilliantly choreographed fights along with the apt background score for every mood that the anime portrays. The storyline is brilliant and every detail seems to be incredibly connected.
It teaches you that true victory is when you win in spite of  the odds  stacked against you and the best thing is that you can relate to so many things you come across in life .It influences the way we approach
                  things and gives us a positive feeling however our situation maybe .It sets an example for all. The effort is greater than the outcome.
For me, the two most important things that i have learnt watching naruto are perseverance and that people always matter the most.",10

                The story centers on Naruto Uzumaki, a young knucklehead ninja who lives in the hidden leaf village of Konoha. He is often shunned and ignored by most people because years ago a fox demon called Nine Tails tried to destroy the village but was sealed inside Naruto as an infant. Wanting to prove himself as a force for good, Naruto makes it his goal to become Hokage, the leader of the village. Once Naruto graduates from the ninja academy, he joins Team 7 headed by elite shinobi (ninja) Kakashi Hatake. Naruto is also joined by Sasuke Uchiha, who wants to avenge his clan by killing
                  his brother, and Sakura Haruno. Together they go on numerous missions honing their jutsu, as Naruto and Sasuke compete and fight alongside each other. The world they live in is populated with colorful characters, as well as villains who want to throw the other nations out of balance for their ends. Particularly the dangerous shinobi Orochimaru, who shows interest in Sasuke for his natural gifts. He offers Sasuke the power he needs to kill his older brother, which results in Naruto and his friends doing everything they can to stop Sasuke from going down a dark path.
Whenever people think of shonen anime, this is usually the type of show that comes to mind. In that, it focuses on the hero’s journey about an underdog with latent powers he didn’t know he had, and trains to hone his abilities as he fights stronger opponents along the way. If you liked “Dragon Ball” but wished it had ninjas, then this is up your alley. 
It’s obvious that creator Masashi Kishimoto was heavily influenced by “Dragon Ball.” You can tell since both series share similar character archetypes, as well as humor. Some of the visual cues are obvious as well with Naruto loosely resembling Super Saiyan Goku’s appearance, and Sasuke resembling Vegeta. Both characters even share a similar frenemy rivalry that plays a major role throughout the series.
Even though its inspirations are obvious, “Naruto” was more grounded in its concept because it was able to tackle meaningful morals and themes that make for deep storytelling. Naruto being an outcast is already something people can identify with. There’s also the fact that he starts out as the least talented ninja of his class. While these are tropes we’ve seen done numerous times, you still want to see what they do with this character. Not only in how he matures, but also in how he literally learns to master his inner demon.
I also like how Naruto and Sasuke have similar backgrounds of having lost their families and are trying to accomplish their individual goals. With Naruto wanting to prove his worth, and Sasuke’s desire to avenge his family. Even though Sasuke is more respected by his peers because of his bloodline, he willingly distances himself from most people because of his tragic past. You see where both characters are coming from and understand why they make the choices they make. While you like seeing them interact with one another, you also want to see them go all out and see who comes out on top, which is what you would expect from a classic anime rivalry.
With that said, there are a few characters I wish were given more purpose. For example, Sakura’s character was not very interesting. Most of the other characters have multiple traits and arcs surrounding them, but for some reason, she’s mainly relegated to the love interest archetype. While they do have her do some action, and even give her an arc where she proves she’s useful, I feel like a lot more could have been done with this character. Eventually, they give her a major role near the end of the series, but I feel it could have been done a lot sooner.",9

                Well, I finally did it. After watching 220 episodes I finally finished the first naruto series and honestly it wasnt as bad as many people led me to believe. Not saying Naruto is a perfect anime and it is far from it by any means.
Story 6. The overall concept of the story had my very hooked at the start, When i was a lot younger i remember staying up to watch bits and pieces of naruto on YTV but i never really had the comprehension of what was going on. The story in naruto started off amazing for me, but when Sasuke went all edge
                  lord and left it started to trend downwards. And then we had to bear through many many filler episodes till shippuden. While some of them entertaining i really felt they held the story back and while i understand it is necessary in an anime of this size, there were much to many for my taste.
Sound 10: The sound in Naruto was one of my favourite points of the show. The openings were amazing with my personal favourite being the second. I really feel whenever i hear them i get to relive watching that part of the show again. The OST was also great, especially the song that plays whenever naruto does something bad ass. My personal favourite track however was shikamarus theme. I felt it fit his character perfectly. All in all the OST and OPS of naruto were amazing in my opinion.
Character 9: I felt the characters in naruto had a lot of development. You can see the growth of them throughout the entire series, even naruto even though he is still childish at the end. You can see him get stronger and slightly more mature throughout the series. Some of my personal favourite characters in anime come from this show. One being Shikamaru and another being Jiraiya. The reason i didnt give this a 10 comes from HOW TRASH SASUKE IS. They ruined one of the most prominent characters in the show by having him be so edgy that he has to leave cuz naruto made a bigger hole in a water tank.
Enjoyment 7: During the main story it was a 10 but the filler was trash so it gets a 7 cause i did have a good time all in all while watching.
Overall 7: All in all naruto is a good anime, In no way is it a masterpiece and in no way is it complete trash. You will get attached to characters and see that it is more than just punching and shadow clones. You should give it a try but if you are not liking it dont waste your time watching 220 episodes of it..",7
"
                Alright, let's get into this. I have watched Naruto as a comfort anime since I began it when I was 7. This review is coming from someone who really likes Naruto to this day, 9 years later. But I will be as honest as possible.
If you are just now watching Naruto I'm sure there aren't as many good reviews, for it's time Naruto was definitely cool and interesting in concept and execution. Also you're pretty late to the party but that's alright :).
The concept is very cool, a story about ninjas, fights, bad guys, and the characters finding themselves? Heck yeah, sign me up. The
                  story is done well, one of the big complaints I saw was the amount of fight scenes. This wasn't really an issue for me as I like action packed anime. 
Another complaint I saw was fillers. And since I started this anime so young, I didn't know what fillers were so they never bothered me. But I re-watch Naruto almost every summer, and honestly they still don't bother me. I always treat filler episodes as a kind of break, for me and the characters. Plus most of the filler episodes were pretty fun, aside from some of the less interesting ones. But if you can't stand fillers I really can't recommend with full confidence no matter how much I love Naruto. That isn't to say that fillers are the whole anime or that they ruin it, but there are a lot and some people would rather not and that's understandable. 
CHARACTERS!! This is where my personal favorite part comes in, but it also comes with some of my biggest complaints. The overall character development is very cool, especially if you continue to Shippuden. The main character, Naruto grows into a very likable person right in front of you. 
Sakura is one of the most complained about, as she is seen as useless and annoying girl who just needs help constantly. But personally she was one of my favorites, because her constantly feeling useless and even being called it by the other characters made her want to be better. And lead to great character development over time.
Sasuke is the edgy mf that younger fans of the anime always end up fangirling over. Not that it's a problem just kind of silly :). He is the mysterious guy, has his own selfish goals and cares not for the rest of the main characters. (seen above). He's also strong from a pretty young age, and smart too with gifts of his own. But he still needed a lot of work to get better and that makes him not so unpleasantly overpowered. He shows a lot of changing of which I can't mention because of spoiler reasons. But he still has a growth throughout the anime, even if it is in a strange kind of way. 
Now my biggest complaints about characters, is that some of them are very interesting and cool in their own ways that are nothing like the main characters. A lot of my favorite characters didn't get a whole lot of screen time and felt VERY slightly neglected. I say slightly because eventually, if I'm not mixing in Shippuden here, most every character gets some kind of screen time with their squad. Which made me very happy to see them have their own little arc. But they do tend to do typical side character things, but they are still pretty well rounded overall.
Fight scenes are an interesting thing to review on Naruto. While being a lover of fight scenes and not really caring how long they go on for, I would get very invested and the time just passed. Some would last several episodes and could have been done in fewer, but it just added a little something I can't explain. But yes there are long fights. 
The fighting animations are really fairly done. I'm not an animator so I feel uncomfortable dissecting it harshly. I felt that it was overall smooth and eye catching. Very proud of the studio. 
Overall 8/10 :)",8

                Review 6: Naruto (Favourite hero of all time)???
now if you haven't ever seen or watched naruto, then ur crazy..... and if you haven't even heard of Naruto....then where the hell have you been all of your life!!!! Nearly every anime fan as watched or has been reading naruto and if you haven't and you love manga or anime then you truely do not deserve the title Super Fans or Fanettes!!!!!!! if you haven't heard of Naruto then i do sort of feel sorry for you in a way, since nearly everyone has at least been reading or has read the naruto series.
i don't want to
                  ruin it for nearly everyone who actually reads this review but it is an amazing series that everyone should check out, it doesn't matter if you read the series or watch the series it really is worth your time and will stay with you for the rest of your life.
obviously naruto is the main character through out the series, he lives in a small village with plenty of other ninjas that are his age and there are plenty more kids you'll meet on the way to discovering who naruto actually is and what can make him so powerfull yet so stupid at times.
Naruto: obviously the main character in the series. he's a young, active and slightly weird boy who loves being a ninja even though he isn't very good at it..... He's crazy even from the beginning of the book when as soon as you go onto the first page he's dangling from a rope painting on the hokage (s) stautes faces, he does get caught and then you can see how weird he actually is. Most of the teachers get extremely annoyed with him no matter what he does, he annoys a lot of people in his classes and is jealous of the strongest and most good looking boy there is named Susuke. He hates him and never gets a long with him, apart from that Naruto can be an annoying boy in the series but as time passes you grow to love him even more! he can be really strong and quick witted at times, like when ever he's in a fight. you'll grow to love him as time passes on.
Sasuke: A mysterious young boy who's about the same age as Naruto, every girl in the school loves him and has an extreme crush on him, he isn't really bothered about all of the girls though he and he doesn't seem to act really cool he just is cool.....naturally!!!!! every time he walks in to the class room all of the girls stare and it falls quiet. Naruto hates his guts because he gets all of the attention off of the girls, Sasuke hates him aswell which must be natural aswell. At the start you'll love him but as the series progresses then your opinions on him may change slightly.
Sakura: Sakura is a young girl about the same age as Sasuke and Naruto, the only difference inbetween Sakura and the other two is the fact that she is mature enough to understand that not everyone has to be rivals in life, she loves almost everything and has the biggest crush on Sasuke ever, but Sasuke captures all of the girls hearts so he doesn't really notice if there is one person stands out more than the others. She has a rivalry with an old freind that you'll meet later on in the series. She doesn't have a mysterious past at all, but when she was younger she did get bullied a lot for having a high forehead which made her stand out a little bit more then everyone else. she's an average character who i think everyone will love from the start.
if you live in england then you might know that there is a magazine called NEO which comes out every month and if you read that then you should now how many films there are on the naruto series, how popular it is, the fact that there are loads of videogames on the series and that naruto has to be in the magazine every month to new releases and new books coming out.
the series is on going and amazing even though it is long. if i was one of you guys and i was reading this i would check it out straight away it really is worth the time and you will enjoy it. i would recommend this to everyone!!!!!!!!!!! of all ages!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                Naruto is one of those anime that anyone with whatever taste in anime can enjoy.Naruto is about a boy named Naruto who wants to become the next Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village.He has along way to go before he gets there.Naruto goes on missions with his teammates,Sasuke[Naruto's rival],Sakura[love triangle between them],and Kakashi[the sensei].Naruto and his team complete mission according to their rank.The show usually likes to start with small missions before they get into a long episode arc.There are plenty of anime were this more over 30+ characters and you probably can't name them all,well this isn't the chase in Naruto.There so many characters
                  and they are very recognizable because they all have different personalities.You also get to see some of them fight against each other and get to know more about them like when Hinata and Neji fight.Most of the others develop much better in Naruto Shippuden.In most of the episodes the Naruto and Sasuke rivalry,it starts with just name calling to finally fighting each other.Another thing about Naruto is that even some of the villains are likeable like Itachi.The fights are a great thing about this too.Not only do they use Ninjutsu,Taijutsu,and Genjutsu,they also have their own little unique power depending on what clan in the village their are from.I can truly see why this anime has plenty of world wide sucsess.

                Naruto was one of my first anime's (other than Pokémon) and I loved it I started watching it in 4th grade when I was only about 10 years old I'm not one of the og's that watched it on cartoon network I watched it on Netflix but I still loved it in story I give it a 10 the reason I give the story a 10 is because it was amazing and I was not bored for a single whole arc (not counting filler) for art I give an 8 since it was made in 2002-2007 it doesn't have the greatest animation but its not
                  that horrible there are some fights that have really smooth animation for sound i give an 8 for characters I give a 7 characters are the only weakness of Naruto as a whole a lot of the characters they just throw away maybe make them do a couple cool things but then they just use them as side characters for example Rock Lee, Shino etc. but a lot of the characters are still good and I really really enjoyed this series I would rewatch it if i had to except the filler so overall I give this series a 9",9

                Naruto it was an ok anime. I wouldn't say great but it was a farily good anime. I really enjoyed it too. I love the story of the nine taled fox. There was a lot of action. There is another part to it too. Naruto Shippuuden is the other part. Two years have passed and now naruto and sakura are finding sasuke still. But I won't spoil that for you. Before watching naruto shippuuden you would have to watch Naruto. personally, I liked Naruto! Lost and lots of action. I liked :) I suggest watching it too.

                Aight so people normally say Naruto is too overhyped and all that but homie went on that grind from zero to hero on god. Watching him start highkey trash at the simplest then push to progress was a ride for sure. Fairly would have rated overall 10 but there do be filler episodes that are kinda meh. Naruto is the storyline so these extra episodes can be sus.
Visuals be above what you'd expect and you learn to even love it to a nostalgic point though in some fights, you may think to yourself they could have done more but not enough to ruin it lol.
                  Audio is kinda jus like any other audio but it def matches what you see very well and gives you a good reason to watch. The character development is the whole ass reason we love Naruto. Homie was down bad and then begins to do something about it, it keeps you wanting him to get better.
Enjoyed the hell outta Naruto, watched it twice (second time I skipped fillers) and still would watch them all again",9

                not the best anime, i think shippuden is waaaay better. i used to watch this show on toonami when it was first being dubbed, and i enjoyed it when i was younger. i agree that it's way over hyped, i wouldn't have began watching the hole series again unless i started getting into shippuden first. the only parts i really liked in this series were the fights, it's kind of sad that half of the episodes are fillers because the actual show is decent.

                Naruto was the first anime I watched and to this day it is still my favorite. where do I even start on this one?! The building of the fantasy world it takes place in is amazing. The five shinobi villages are in constant turmoil, but have to work together for the good of the world. It takes the already fascinating concept of ninjas and puts a fantastic twist on it creating something new and amazing. The characters are lovable and relatable, and even the villains can win your heart over! With a soundtrack that makes the tone of each scene really stand out, and outstanding
                  fight choreography, what doesn't it have? Naruto also has a heartwarming, moving theme of good morals and not giving up, even if you're the underdog. Top it off with the unique powers the shinobi possess, Naruto is deserving of a 10/10 rating.",10
"
                Before I have seen Naruto, I have watched a couple of anime back then and nothing really caught my attention unlike this one. What is intriguing about this one is that they used a clever trick to keep your mind wondering what will happen next. But what makes this show special is the lessons and philosophies in life were scaled down where little kids would get attracted to and first time anime watchers as well. After years of putting smiles, tears and hope for children, the show went on and aimed for those same children who are now more mature and thus, Naruto Shippuden was
                  born – a show that is also more mature and, actually, better than the first one. It is highly recommended for you to see this first before going onto Shippuden although some of you may think that it is a pain to watch all 220 episodes just to see Shippuden.
Story (7/10)
The story is quite unique in a way – it was set in an entirely different world which, at the same time, resembles real life situations such as wars, laws, conflicts, vengeance, hatred, loyalty, patriotism, and friendship. Although some may say it may resemble other anime, but the setting and the situation of this one is quite different, being in a world of ninjas and all. As mentioned earlier, they ingeniously designed each episode to make your mind wonder what will happen next whereas in psychology, they will feed you what you desire and before you become fully satisfied, they will take it away from you so that you will want to see what will happen in the next episode.
Art (8/10)
Art varies from artist to artist. An artist who is more into dark and morbid things might find the art, as for I, quite so so and vice versa. Although I must admit that they made the character designs quite unique and memorable. They also did a good job making the main protagonist unique by drawing whiskers on his face, although some of you may wonder as to why he has whiskers so try to read the first Naruto published in One Shot.
Sound (8/10)
They did a good job in matching the emotions in every scene with the music and in every fight scene, you would have this epic feeling, trying to wonder who will win the battle. 
Character (9/10)
Every character has their own unique personality, philosophy and way of living. There are the annoying types who you wish would just die already, those who are strange, over the top, hardworking and over dramatic types of ninjas, the mysterious genius type, a hyperactive knuckle head ninja and so on.
As time change, people also change along with it; as the series progress, the characters also progress and change. In the end, you will find the characters entirely different from how they were when the series had started. 
Enjoyment (9/10)
Although there are so many fillers in this show although it was quite enjoyable. The fillers were so so, but it is amazing and quite the experience. Sometimes you will find yourself making the same hand signs and mimicking the characters. In other words, you will find yourself trying to become one of them, a ninja.",8

                Uh what a bad anime.
STORY
Classic zero to hero story. But it's a very lazy story and full of bullshit.
The power balance of the characters is ridiculous. Very weak characters can suddenly get power-ups and be victorious.  The relationship between Sasuke and Naruto makes me to my stomach. It seems so fake that people who hate each other so much have weird love. 
ART
The visuals are very bad as they have to shoot so many episodes. There is almost no fighting animation. Have silly word duels.
SOUNDNaruto's voice is incredibly annoying. Other than that no problem.
CHARACTER
Oh man... I hate Naruto,Sasuke and Sakura really bad. All of them are incredibly frustrating. I love Kakashi. But I hate most characters of Naruto. Cringy.
ENJOYMENT
There are many flashbacks. Characters are looking each other lmao. Saying same things again and again. Most of episodes are soooo boring.
Oh man. What a garbage.",4
"
                Great. Although this is for kids actually, teens can totally relate to it. But I was a bit disappointed with the character output. The personality of the characters were a bit edgy, especially Haruno Sakura. I don't think her personality suits her. She's too brutal on Naruto, and a bit fake on others, especially Sasuke. 
But despite this flaw, Naruto is one of the must-see anime titles for everyone. Trust me, it's one of those you'll remember for a long, long time.

                Minor Spoilers here read at own risk
Just a heads up I skipped all but one episode of filler for Naruto. So my opinions are just of the canon.  
The story of Naruto is actually quite hard to explain. It follows 5 canon story arcs. The Prologue arc, The Chunin Exam Arc, The Konoha Crush Arc, The Tsunade Arc and the Sasuke Retrieval arc. Each arc has its own complex story that tends to build off of the previous arc. It's done very well actually, to the point where I didn't realize that the Konoha Crush arc happened. I had thought for the longest time
                  that it the Konoha Crush arc was a part of the Chunin Exam arc. Some could see this as a problem, the show failing to show the start of a new arc. I think I was just being stupid lol. Each story arc has its own ups and down. I could be here all day talking about them. In my opinion the Chunin Exam arc and the Sasuke Retrieval Arc are definitely the best.  
One thing I wanna highlight is Naruto's great character development and how the anime shows you his character development. All of the main arc antagonist act as foils to Naruto. In the beginning of the anime, Naruto is selfish. One of the two main arc ""villains"" is the exact opposite of Naruto at this point. Haku's dream to help Zabuza achieve his dream. Every single action Haku does, he does for his friend. In the Chunin Exam arc, Naruto believes that anyone can become strong if they try hard enough. He believes in his strength and the strength of his friends. Two characters that Naruto believes in are Hinata and Rock Lee. The main arc antagonist, Neji, believes that people, like Naruto and his friends are born failures and will always be failures. The Knoha Crush arc, Gaara fights for only himself, Naruto fights to protect his friends. You get the idea. Each arc villain is used to show how much Naruto has grown as a ninja and as a person. He learns to care about his friends over anything else, which is a huge difference from when he started.    
I will be the first to admit, Naruot's main three characters are very annoying at times. You have the bratty Naruto, the edgey Sasuke and the useless Sakura. To make up for having three somewhat unlikable main characters, you have a butt load of side characters. Kiba, Shino, Hinata, Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, Neji, Rock Lee, TenTen, and much much more. So there is bound to be one character you will end up liking. For me it was Shikamaru, Gaara, and my favorite Naruto character, Rock Lee. 
But despite having a large cast of side characters, the female characters almost as a whole are boring and useless. Its really sad, Sakura and Ino are just carbon copies of each other, except Ino is a little more mean. TenTen does nothing at all in the canon episodes. I think she has one fight and then is only seen again to explain minor things to the audience. Hinata is a really interesting character, but is under used. Temari is a really fun character that gets some cool fights, but is also under used. The coolest female character doesn't appear till the fourth main story arc. It's saddening to see no real effort put into the female side characters. 
The Op's For Naruto are pretty good for the most part. They are really fun at times and help to show the theme of some of the story arcs. Though Op 6, 7, 8, 9 are during filler so they don't have that much to work with sadly. That leads to op 7 and 8 being pretty disappointing for the most part. Despite taking place during filler, Op 9 has become a fan favorite. Due to it's impressive use of silhouette fight scenes in the op. Personal favorites of mine are Op 3 and 5. Op 3 because it shows a clear theme of moving on with your past and getting trough loneliness. And Op 5 because it is just a really fun op that does foreshadow a few important events that take place in the story. 
The art for Naruto is average and inconstant at times. The art style will just randomly change between some important episodes. It tends to change right before an important fight. It's annoying to have it suddenly change for a few episodes, then goes right back to the normal art style.    
The biggest problem for this show comes is the Mary Sue elements they throw in there. Mary Sue is a term for a character that is perfect in every way and solves everything problem with some stupid new ability that he//she just suddenly obtains. The best example of this is Neo from the Matrix. None of Naruto's characters are perfect, they all have clear flaws that are easily noticeable. But it's that second part of a Mary Sue that Naruto falls victim to. 
Sasuke Uchiha is almost a complete Mary Sue. If it wasn't for him being a complete jerk to everyone, he would be 100% Mary Sue. Everyone loves Sasuke. They all think he is awesome and show loves to remind you that fact over and over again. Despite his awful attitude and the fact that he literally cares about no one, he is loved and cherished by all. Almost all the girls at one point think about how cute Sasuke is. He is the equivalent of Kirito from SAO. Except you are forced to deal with Sasuke for over 100 episodes. 
The biggest problem with Sasuke is his special ability, Sharingan. The Sharingan allows Sasuke to predict his opponents moves and copy them. It's really cool at first, till you realize how stupid it is. The Sharingan also has a hypnotic ability that is stupid powerful. At this point Sasuke's Sharingan is in the weaker stages, but it still lets him when many fights he should easily lose. At one point they make you think Sasuke won't win every single fight with Sharingan, and while he does lose a few fights, the Sharangin allows him to win many fights he should lose. The Sharingan also randomly powers up when it needs to. When Sasuke can't see his opponents movements, boom, Sharingan upgrades. If it wasn't for Sharingan, Sasuke would be easier to deal with.
Naruto himself also falls victim to the random bursts of power that Mary Sues have. But with Naruto it is much easier to deal with because his power up, being the Chakra of the nine-tailed beast, only powers him up when needed. He isn't constantly using the nine-tailed beast chakra, he only uses a little bit of it in his fights. Some fights he doesn't use it at all. And unlike Sasuke who is just naturally good with Sharingan, it takes Naruot a lot of time to learn the basics of controlling the beasts chakra. And even with this massive power boast he still loses some fights with it. It doesn't feel overpowered because Naruto isn't using it constantly, he only uses its full power against incredibly powerful opponents. 
Now to talk about my favorite thing in Naruto, the fights. Naruto's fights feel so impressive because of justu. Justu is basically the equivalent to ki attacks in DBZ. There is limitless possibilities with justu. Each character has a special move or move type. Naruto has shadow clone justu, Sasuke has Chodori, Shikamaru has shadow possession justu, etc. Their move pool is limited to only 1 or 2 justus (unless you are Sasuke, he has 4 justu) so seeing them have to think of special strategy to win their fights. Shikamaru's fights, in particular, are very impressive. The show establishes the fact that he is a genies and use it fully. He comes up with incredible strategies to win his fights, yet he always stays true to his lazy nature. 
It's actually funny, cause Naruto's fights are actually pretty boring. Until the fourth story arc, the only real combat move he knows is shadow clone justu. So most of his fights just become a punching match. And as much as I hate Sasuke, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy his fights a lot. But, the most impressive fighter has to be Rock Lee. He can't use justu of any kind. So instead he uses taijustu, which is hand to hand combat. He is at a massive disadvantage in every single fight, yet he still does an amazing job. Even if he doesn't win every fight, he always wears his opponent down. 
There are so many good things about Naruto, the fights, the decent plot, Naruto's character development,  the side characters. But the flaws in the show are big, a lack of strong female characters and Sasuke's whole entire character.
Just Sasuke's presence ruins multiple scenes. Characters like Sasuke are bland characters with so much wasted potential. When the show tries to get you to care and feel bad about Sasuke it fails. Because we know who Sasuke is, it doesn't matter how sad his past is when we can't relate to him in the present. We can't like him in the present because he isn't a good person at all. He was only a good person as a child, if the show started with that and then we saw the transformation of him becoming a jerk in the beginning of the series, then maybe we could care about him. But, he starts the show off as a jerk and ends the show off as an even bigger jerk than he was before. 
Despite my problems with Sasuke and the female characters, I would sill recommend Naruto to anyone. It is a good show, with many great qualities. The show struggles in regard to girls and Sasuke, but besides that, I found myself enjoying almost every single moment of Naruto. Naruto gets a",7

                4. Continuing from my DBZ, Digimon and Pokemon reviews, I am still documenting my anime journey.
By now we were already addicted to anime. Naruto and One Piece were running at the same time as DBZ on TV and we did not give it as much attention.
Back then DBZ was in full swing: Frieza fight and the android arc.
Meanwhile Naruto was re-airing from the very beginning while One Piece was still going slow and steady in the East Blue saga.
We naturally started watching Naruto and it quickly grew on us. The emotional scenes, the characters, the absolutely amazing sound and the fights, god the fights!
While DBZ
                  threw sheer power at us and completely forsake the martial arts aspect of the original Dragon Ball (1986) in exchange for energy blasts and hair color changes..
(All of that naturally pissed off Akira Toriyama the creator of DBZ but that is a history lesson now, I advise watching YouTube documentaries if that topic interests you).
Naruto's characters were simple humans who had to use skills to win instead of sheer power. The fights were more technical and tactical. The world building and power system (Chakra) supported that aspect and made the fights even more dynamic and breathtaking.
DBZ made us fall in love with the Shounen genre, but Naruto was the final nail in the coffin. Shounen is just amazing.
The interjection of Japanese culture and religion into the setting was cool and the perfect choice for a Japanese ninja story. I subjectively believe that to be the strongest point of the anime and that without it, Naruto would not have grown to be so big.
The slow pacing at some times was annoying but we kids were already conditioned by DBZ. In fact, we were thankful that it was not as horrible in that aspect as DBZ.
But the thing that killed us, were the damn fillers. We had a taste of it in DBZ and did not want seconds.
But back then the internet was still young and we did not think of looking up guides to skip fillers..
So sometimes we sat through that BS. But other times when it was very apparent, we just turned it off and went to play PS2 games like San Andreas.
(issue is we got lost in time and sometimes forgot to turn on the next show like One Piece or Detective Conan which made us frustrated and hate Naruto fillers even more but with a deeper passion)
After the final arc, every episode was filler from then on. So we all dropped the show. When they announced Shippuuden we got hope again but that too was riddled with fillers...
Thanks to that, filler guides starting popping off and we made use of them.
But on TV, you can never know which episode they will show and we all were tired of waiting every day, tired of waiting through the horrible pacing and fillers.
Hence why most of us raised the black flags and sailed the pirate sea.
Watching in Jap dub with Eng subs proved to be much better!
We could feel the superb voice acting that was much better than western dub. The sub translations were much more accurate than the censored and butchered western dub.
While we were watching the re-airing of a 2002 show, everyone else in the world was already 200 episodes deep in the 2007 Shippuuden show!
We naturally had to catch up.
This was the start of everyone's transition from TV to the internet where we could chose what to watch and when to watch it.
Fillers and recaps could be skipped easily.
Slow pacing? Just speed up the vid or skip the repeats.
Naruto became much more enjoyable. Yet the whole filler arcs that lasted for 10-20+ episodes were annoying, we basically had a months-years long Naruto drought.
Which lead many of us to start reading the manga because we were that invested in the story.
(maybe that was the reason for the artificial drought? they wanted viewers to start buying more manga.)
Say what you want about Naruto, it had many flaws and weaknesses. But it was a very good show.
1)How they wasted Rock Lee's character, I will never forgive Masashi Kishimoto.
2) Sakura being the worst character in the existence of anime. It's not particularly her fault but that of the writer. He is incapable of writing female characters. Many worship Kishimoto as a god but he is not perfect.
3) Boruto is basically the fillers come to life. Naturally the studio can't let such a golden goose die because the story is over. They have to milk it until the horse is dead. What a shameful fleck on the reputation of Naruto.
Naruto is what turned us from basic casual viewers into actual anime fans.
With the internet, the whole anime world was open for us.
Back then there were no MyAnimeList websites, reviews or recommendations.
We just went to shaddy websites, picked the one anime out of thousands that had a cool title or picture and watched it. Discovering a lot of masterpieces and trash in the proccess.
Both in the world of anime and manga.
Naruto has proven that Japan has more to offer while the West was drowning in their own incompetence and corruption (well until Avatar: TLA).
Naruto is truly a gateway anime and can be used to introduce newcomers to anime.
But it never really stood a chance against the King of Pirates..",8
"
                Everybody likes ninjas, everybody likes orange jumpsuits. Therefore, everybody likes Naruto. I think that's how it goes but I've heard some other stuff too. Naruto for me was one of my favorites when I was in middle school and high school. It was also the favorite of many of my friends.
I enjoyed most of Naruto except for the terrible fillers.
Story- Generic shonen stuff. Main character wants to be the best of the best and will strive until he is the best of the best. 
Art- Gets better.
Sound- YesCharacter- No comments
Enjoyment- Shonen to young men like me are usually all enjoyable. It's just that Naruto was more self enjoyment rather than i want to know what happens enjoyment.
Overall- Average-ish, not something godlike",6
"
                Well there is a lot to say here but if you want a long anime that will manage to keep you interested all the way, then this is for you.
if you want good story with adrenaline moments and epic fights dont even finish reading this review just start watching it already what are you waiting for !
It is not action packed all the time even though it has epic fights so dont mistaken that but nevertheless it is very good combined on the action part with breakdowns in between and it also has its own feel moments, so its a good mix of almost everything
                  you would want in a action/adventure/martial arts anime.
So overall if you dont mind that it has fillers for a few episodes, few times in the anime then you should give it a try for sure, it wont disappoint you",9
"
                I was very lucky when I first watched this Anime when I was a kid. The moments when I laughed, when I cried, when I anxiously looked forward to each episode must have become a part of my soul. Is this anime good or not? Amazing. I've rewatched this Anime many times, and you know, characters I used to hate or felt strongly against, I love them more and more each day, I guess as we grow older, a part of us understand what the villains of the story are going through, we empathize with them, and so they suddenly become more magical in our
                  hearts.",9
"
                It took me long enough but Im finally here !! That's right, here I am in 2018 and I have finally watched Naruto for the first time in my life. Due to it's enormous popularity and reputation, this became one of my most anticipated series ever. I know so many Naruto fans, back in elementary school during recess all this kids would perform these moves on each other called ""jutsu."" Me being the oddball had know idea what that was and I was picked on for it, BUT I DO NOW !!! Alright let's get started Naruto is the anime adaptation of the extremely successful
                  manga created by Masashi Kishimoto that centers around a fictionalized version of ninjas. Instead of showing us the entire story it mainly focuses on Part 1 of the manga during Naruto's pre-teen years. It came from Studio Pierrot, the same studio that would eventually work on Bleach. I watched this whole series on Netflix and now that I've completed it here's my review.***contains MINOR spoilers***
Story: 7/10
An inspiring tale thats both childish and mature. This is a series that gives us a childish story while using a mature setting. In this world kids go to school to become ninjas in other words they live to fight, battle, eventually have to put their lives on the line. It's definitely a place that can be very rough BUT that's what makes the series so enthralling. Anything can happen and becuz of this it's hard not be into it and it makes u wanna pay attention to all the details. What I like so much is how it centers around Japanese folklore, for example the use of the supernatural animals such as the Nine-Tailed Fox, the Giant Toad, etc. We are given a thrilling journey that's filled with emotional weight which is why it's easy to get pissed off when it drags. The series is infamous for its heavy use of flashbacks and worst of all they give u it during the great fight scenes. While all flashbacks are important that give you great insight, they should've been used at better times. Like most shonens Naruto has filler, a lot of filler, and most of them SUCK. There was only one filler that was enjoyable and that was ep. 101 cuz it was HILARIOUS. The great thing is that the story and plots here are really just glimpse on what's to come in the future, and it's a very good story that has the potential to be amazing.
Art: 7/10
The art and visuals are good, but the animation is a mixed bag. Keep in mind this series is a lil old so the show's look will look dated to some. The character designs are very unique with several having their own hair styles, color, uniforms, and abilities. I always found it weird how Naruto wears orange and blue, strange choice for a wannabe ninja. Funny thing all the characters don't look like ninjas that we're accustomed to seeing, no one wears black outfits or anything Kakashi is really the only one that resembles one due to wearing a mask. The visuals are done well particularly the abilities like the Chidori and the Rasengan. Animation does struggle at times but can also look real good especially during battle scenes. For example in ep. 133 the fight between Naruto and Sasuke looked very fluid compared to most scenes of the series. This was due to having a different key animator from the other episodes. Problem is when you having long running shows like this, keeping consistent animation can be very difficult. Whenever there's a battle going on, that's Naruto's animation at its best.
Sound: 9/10
The overall music here is very good. The opening and ending themes start great but then kinda got worse as the series went along. For example the first OP, ""ROCKS"" was my favorite opening track as well as the first ED, ""Wind."" Imo, ""Wind"" was such catchy song and although the performing sang like his mouth was filled with marbles, it had a beautiful sad tone to it. But after that I wasn't crazy bout any other track, I know a lot of fans love the forth OP, ""Go!!!"" but tbh I wasn't a big fan of it. But my favorite overall track of course has to be the Naruto theme. It has an awesome Japanese vibe to it that gets you hype due to its guitar parts and was used on many occasions and even has its own piano versions. As for voice acting is was great, there are several memorable quotes by many characters. There's ofc Naruto's famous catchphrase, ""dattebayo."" This is a verbal tic that the character has and he says this repeatedly at end of most his sentences.
Character: 9/10
A large deep cast filled with cliched characters. Leading the cast is the hyperactive knuckle headed ninja, Naruto Uzumaki. He can be a mixed bag as well, he's basically an attention seeking ramen loving kid who can be very annoying. However it's easy to understand where he comes from and why he wants to achieve his goal so badly. Due to this he really is an inspiring character that's filled wit heart and energy that we deeply root for. Sasuke Uchiha is the typical rival who serves as competition to Naruto(although both have different goals). Don't get me wrong he's a cool character with great fighting skills but due to his cold personality he comes off as bland. Plus he's not given a lot of depth and if it wasn't for his amazing backstory he wouldn't be that interesting. Then there's Sakura Haruno, who many fans dislike. Once again another cliche character that serves as the love interest to the protagonist. Her characterization just isn't so good, although she plays a big role, most times she just seems useless. However she does has her highlights and towards the end you can see her development start to pick up. The villains are the bug standout here, they all have great backstories that flesh out their motives well and their threatening that gives the cast a challenge. While most come off as cliche the reason why I give it a high score is cuz of the potential they all have. Again this is Part 1 of the manga so there are plenty room of development here.
Final Verdict
Pros
+An inspiring story that's very deep and is on the verge of getting better
+Great villains that really drive the series and make it complex
+Battles scenes are well animated and truly are exciting
+A well made OST that's used very well and makes the series intense
Cons
-Fight scenes drag due to heavy use of flashbacks
-Excessive filler were very bad and mainly used as padding
-Majority of the cast comes off as cliche
-Animation needs to stay consistent

Talk about outstaying its welcome, the last 80 freakin episodes were filler well technically the very last one had canon. As for the dub it had solid performances hell I thought Gaara sounded better in English. However this is a must watch in sub, in the dub Naruto's ""dattebayo"" is replaced with ""believe it."" While catchy is was used more as a punctuation rather than a verbal tic which changes his character a lil bit, plus the Japanese performances are great. After finally watching this iconic series and I can definitely see why it has a lot of fans. How can we not like a series that has great villains, awesome battles, and can be funny when it wants to. What makes me even more excited is that we haven't even reach the bulk of its main story. Potential is all up in the air here and it's up to its sequel Shippuden to live up to it. And don't worry I'll watching it as soon as I can.
Sub or Dub Recommendation: Sub",8

                I liked and enjoyed this anime a lot, because I was quite captivated and also because I had a lot of fun, its characters, its music and even its history, maybe I was very interested in the history of some characters, such as the story of Sasuke, Among others, there are also moments of comedy, especially in the stuffing, but the most serious in this anime, is that Sasuke betrays the village, goes with the sound equipment, a dangerous gang of the Shinobi world, while Naruto and Sakura They are worried about this boy in blue clothes and black hair, Sasuke, one day after the
                  tragic moment, Shikamaru has a mission, which is Sasuke's recovery mission, and forms a group for the mission, there are 5 boys, who They are Naruto, Neji, Choji, Kiba and what the leader of the group is Shikamaru, since he graduated in Chunin, shortly after the battles of these 5 boys, in the battle between Naruto and Kimimaro, is involved Rock Lee, is Because he is The hospital's cape, ran and ran, as I said, intervenes in the battle, and fights with Kimimaro with all his strength, while Shikamaru and Choji continue to struggle with their energies, although Naruto is looking for Sasuke everywhere, after All that, the team arrives from the sand village, of which they are Gaara, Kankuro and Temari, because they are about to save Rock Lee, Kiba and Shikamaru, so that they last more years, and these easily defeat the sound equipment, although Neji and Choji were the ones who defeated the Two of the first of this sound equipment, which are Kidomaru and Jirobo
And when Naruto finally reached Sasuke's footsteps, they decided to make a very strong battle, and the part that caught my attention in this battle between them is when Naruto and Sasuke are transformed to the maximum prepare their techniques to the maximum power And energy, attacking from hand to hand, that Naruto was using the Rasengan and Sasuke the Chidori, and this is the moment that I liked the most of this anime, my favorite saga is the invasion of Konoha, that is where Naruto and Gaara They fight, but in fact my favorite saga is the Sasuke Recovery Mission, there I am called the attention.
And for this reason, it's my second favorite anime.",10

                Naruto... 
Naruto is one of those anime where it's a tad bit too long, but I had to watch it because it has another series. So I had to watch it all, because I want to watch the next series. 
The things that Naruto has that most anime don't have is amazing fight scenes. The one fight that lasted a few episodes was intense. That was, in my opinion, the best fight in anime ever. Although I haven't seen the next series, that probably put that fight scene in the second best fight scene I've seen. 
The story was good. I mean, the story has
                  it all. The fight scenes has story in them, and that is good. 
The art is meh. I don't know if it's the early 2000's animation style, but it's not as pretty as the other anime I've watched. 
The music is where it's at. I loved the music, I even have one of the songs on my playlist. It's just amazing. 
The character development is amazing too. Just the right amount too. Not too much that it has to be an whole episode itself, but not too little that it's no development at all. 
Overall, I really enjoyed it. I'm not sure if it's nostalgia talking, but it's good, and I enjoyed it.",9
"
                well this was a really good anime it kept me entertained for a long time it's packed full of action and i think most people will agree the only thing i disliked about naruto is that it has to many filler eps but apart from them its really good the fighting the charecters and the emotion keeps you hooked all the way till the end so if your a noob our a veteran you will enjoy this im gonna give this 9/10 hope this helps :] 
              ",9

                Its a true classic in the anime world, and despite it's fair age the art and story are still just as watchable as they always were. the Naruto anime, along with it's sequel Shippuden are almost like books in just how much depth the story will go into. No stone is left un-turned in the plot line, and even minor characters will have plenty of screen time to give you an idea of how it all came to be in the final battle of shippuden. it's practically impossible to not find at least one character relatable and likeable in the world of Konoha because their
                  are just so many! usually this leads to confusion because one character looks like this one and what not, but having as many episodes as Naruto means that character development really isn't a problem, and despite what it may seem, the many plots and villains really do lead to one point, by which time it almost seems as if you know the characters personally! Naruto doesn't hesitate to throw plots in unexpected directions with character deaths and fight scenes that made the anime the legend it is today. Naruto has sad storylines, joyful and exciting moments and unexpected plot turns at every angle, so long as you can deal with the all too famous fillers, you're sure to be enthralled by Naruto's story.",8
"
                Meh... I am not the hugest fan of Naruto. But let me make it clear, I am not trying to be the enemy here. NARUTO IS NOT BAD ANIME. 
So let me start off with the good. I really did enjoy Naruto for the character development, you can really see Naruto gets more mature as it progresses (Not talking about Shippuden). Its also really fascinating to see all the new Jutsu that Naruto starts learning and he also learns to walk on water. But also like every anime he has a goal, to become Hokage. The anime is really amusing and it can get really
                  intense and some points, not a lot of emotional parts though which is a shame.
Now the bad part about the review. 
Naruto gets super repetitive. The story starts off like ""i want to become the hokage"" and they start doing missions which dont help in becoming Hokage at all. Also Naruto gets really off track when something happens to Sasuke. 
The other thing is the english dub voice acting, it sounds like Naruto smokes like 10 packs of cigs a day
In conclusion, i don't hate Naruto. I sincerely don't. But Naruto is extremely overrated, but i still think you should watch it because its not necessarily a ""bad"" anime but just a little repetitive. Also FILLERS EVERYWHERE!",7
"
                Safe to say that for me this was hard carried by the few(unfortunately) moments I saw of Kakashi and Shikamaru... The pacing was not great, I obviously skipped the fillers(that I may come back to watch if I feel like it) but still too many flashbacks and dragged scenes. 
The fights were not great imo just decent with some pretty good moments but nothing amazing and again too dragged.
I liked the characters and the interactions with each other during the peaceful and silly scenes but some things about the story didn't make sense, hoping they will get cleared in Shippuden but I doubt it so
                  I guess they were just plot holes(nothing major but it still bothered me a little).
Overall I enjoyed it especially the second half but I have definitely seen better... I heard Shippuden is better so yeah I REALLY hope so.",7

                The plot of my childhood, an anime of overcoming, ignoring the haters (kk) and of course... Unlimited fun! I really enjoyed this exceptional work by Kishimoto! And I thought that my anime at the top of the anime would be DBZ or CDZ... It turned out that the orange ninja was in the 1 of the ranking! I am right! The only reason I don't put 10 in everything is due to the lack of development of a few characters that only later, in Shippuden, was explained! Something that I believe should already have in the classic!
I'll do a review of Shippuden too... For now,
                  I want to review this work a few more times and admit that I ate more noodles after I saw Narutão do that several times in the work... I don't like spoilers, but I believe that Gaara should have already become Kage in the classic and Jiraya could have trained Naruto in control techniques in some eps of the classic... But the Itachi part... That unique villain sacrifice.. Boy... It was very good this resourcefulness about a story that, before in one form, now in another!
It's an anime that plays a big part in my cycle of friendships and the like... Anyway, it's Naruto!
<In portuguese> A trama da minha infância, um anime de superação, ignorar os haters(kk) e claro... Diversão sem limites! Gostei muito dessa excepcional obra de Kishimoto! E eu achando que meu anime do topo dos animes seria DBZ ou CDZ... Acabou que o ninja laranja ficou no 1 do ranking! Tô certo! Só não coloco 10 em tudo pela falta de desenvolvimento de uns poucos personagens que só mais tarde, no Shippuden, foi explicado! Coisa que eu acredito que já deveria ter no clássico!
Vou fazer uma review do Shippuden também... Por ora, quero rever essa obra mais algumas vezes e admitir que eu comi mais miojo depois que eu vi o Narutão fazer isso várias vezes na obra... Não gosto de spoilers, mas acredito que o Gaara já deveria ter se tornado Kage no clássico e o Jiraya poderia ter treinado o Naruto nas técnicas de controle em alguns eps do clássico... Mas a parte do Itachi... Esse sacrifício de vilão único.. Rapaz... Foi muito bom essa desenvoltura e a porrada de informação sobre uma história que, antes de uma forma, doravante de outra!
É um anime que faz muita parte em meu ciclo de amizades e afins... Enfim, é Naruto!</in portuguese>",9

                I've seen a lot of anime throughout the years. I've seen what people call the 'good stuff', I've seen the 'bad stuff'. In time, I realized and accepted that not everyone is going to like something, or dislike it. No matter what the anime (or movie, or book, or game, etc.) it boils down to personal preference. So, how do you know if you'd like something you've never seen but heard so much about? When I first started Naruto, I saw the potential in it. From the first episode, they presented a distinct setting with distinct characters. Sure, archetypes were being followed (the boy dreaming
                  of becoming big, the old grandfatherly figure, the teacher, the rival). The first episode showed emotion and depth to its main character and what he will struggle with, along with the dynamics of his interaction with other characters and their quirks.",10
"
                Ah yes, NARUTO. One of the most viewed animes but why is it ranked so low?
Is it because it has countless fillers? 
Excessive drama?
Low graphics?
Alright so first of all we gotta keep in account that Naruto is a very old anime aired in 2002 upto 2007. You should never compare Naruto with short and kinda modern animes like Shingeki no Kyojin, Kimetsu no Yaiba, etc. Ok so Death Note is the most viewed in Mal and also got a pretty good ranking. It was aired in 2006 but considering that it has just 37 eps, is also not an anime to be compared with Naruto.
                  
You must rank an anime keeping in mind how old it is and how long it is. 
Why is Naruto so long? Because it has 89 filler episodes. To be honest, these fillers were quite appreciated in Naruto’s airing days as they are enjoyable and some of the small arcs are interesting too. Being a teen and watching so many great animes, I honestly didn’t mind watching those 89 fillers at all. They are quite worth the time.
Is there excessive drama in the anime? Well, there is likely to be not much weird or irritating drama in the cannon episodes but you shall find a lot of drama in the fillers as they are meant to be funny and enjoyable. It’s also not quite right to say that those funny fillers have too much irritating drama in them. 
Why is Naruto a bit bad in video quality and animated graphics? Now-a-days, a lot of viewers really confessed their dislike upon the graphics and quality. Considering that the anime was created in 2002, I don’t think that the video quality was not good. There are likely some flaws in the fighting scenes but it is negligible I suppose.
I am personally a Narutard and this anime was my first anime ever, like many others. I am not saying that this is the best there is. I have obviously seen better but I don’t think it is an anime to be kept aside, despite being 220 episodes. The plots in the story are amusing and having so many important characters with different personality truly makes the anime outstanding. 
Those who are yet to see Naruto are probably thinking that the anime is too long. The anime has been faked by a lot of weebs so I would see the anime myself rather than reading reviews of others that would prevent the chance to get misguided. If the anime is too long for you, just skip the fillers to experience the awesomeness but fillers provide the enjoyment of laughter and I think that the anime is wholesome filled with thrill and comfort.",8
"
                Hey, I started watching this anime quite a bit later than I think most people. I started on Naruto ship, and then realised that there was a series before that. And so I stared to watch and fell instantly in love with it. The characters all have there own unique personalities. Which makes for a more interesting watch. Also I like the fact that in some parts Naruto can be really derpy and funny and then become quite serious at the same time depending on the circumstance. 
Also this anime does start to show what friendship and loyalty to people can really mean. E.g Naruto
                  fighting to protect his friends, and going to help out some the sand ninjas because they did too. Which I feel shows that if you value your friends they will help out.
This anime also has some really good morale messages and also how peoples dreams are important to them. And how they will do anything to try and protect them. And he would even put his body on the line for them.
So I feel overall that it is a really good anime which I really enjoyed. I hope you found this review helpful and enjoyable",8
"
                I have a lot say about Naruto but I will focus mostly on Part 1.
Here we go.
Naruto has always been a phenomenon. Even from the very beginning, it had something to offer to our culture. It explored Ninjas who use strategy to overcome obstacles, it explored rivalries that can never be matched by others, it explores progression through training and hard work and how sometimes hard work beats talent when talent isn't enough (quote-on-quote: Rock Lee vs Gaara).
Part 1, I have to say, really does feel a little different compared to Shippuden and in that, it's a small scale adventure about a kid wanting to
                  be the best ninja in the world as well as a Hokage when he grows up. He wants to surpass everyone even himself and is willing to take any challenge that comes his way in order to get to the top. All the characters in Part 1 are uniquely dressed and characterized, they each have their own preset skills and abilities as well as personalities. They feel like characters and because of their design, they hard to forget even when the show ends and we're left to deal with Shippuden which has a LOT more characters.
To be honest, there is no ""greatest anime"" but there are ""one of the greatest"". Is Naruto one of them? Maybe or Maybe not.
There's no denying that Naruto Part 1 is great. From the way it deals with characters as well as their designs and how they convey a certain character's personality. Each member of Team 7, Team Asuma, Team Kurenai and Team Guy; all have their own identity and this is truly when Naruto was at top before it had it's slow fall (aka the case of Star Wars: The Original Trilogy all the way to the inevitable Prequels).
The main villain was one-dimensional at best, there was no interesting part about him other than him just getting to his goals. He was, however, a great villain for who he was. And despite him needing a lot of people by his side in order to achieve his objectives, he was very much terrifying and intimidating.
Itachi, however, is on a whole other level of villainy and I will leave Shippuden to deal with that fact.
Like I said before, Naruto is a phenomenon. And we have to thank Part 1 for making it all possible.",8
"
                Feels like this show pulled a bait and switch. The beginning chunk of episodes are great, good story with character development and setting the scene for a large world of ninja action. The fights are great, mysteries get you hooked, plenty of characters to identify with, comedy to balance the overall seriousness of the plot. But then it seems like the writers put on ""loop"" and called it a day. Overused plot lines, predictable outcomes, lack of character diversity, inability to tie earlier elements to recent events, ect. It may simple be the drawback of animating a Shonen maga, but other shows pulled it off
                  where Naruto falls short. After finishing it, something feels missing. It's fine, but nowhere the ""instant classic"" I was led to believe by the many lifelong fans.",6
"
                I feel like both Naruto and Naruto Shippuden were significantly different. Naruto was about these kids living in a world of ninjas and their own takes on said world while Shippuden dedicates itself to ""Saving Sasuke"" and leaves everything else in the backseat. I'm not saying that his show doesn't have any flaws but it has less flaws than Shippuden. I'd saw it has two big flaws which is the fillers and the same old Jump series flaws. I didn't have the pleasure of watching this as a kid because in Puerto Rico most kids grew up watching either Dragonball Z, Pokemon or Yu Gi
                  Oh but I'm pretty sure that if I watched this series as a kid, I would be a BIG fan. 
In conclusion: I recommend this series to anyone who loves fictional worlds or the ninja culture. I wouldn't recommend watching Shippuden though but you're still gonna have to watch it if you want to know what happens to the characters. My suggestion is to avoid the fillers as much as possible and don't be surprised if you get confused at times and see for yourself if it's good or not. 
 In short: My opinion about this anime is Naruto > Naruto Shippuden",8
"
                I read the manga first before watching it and had high hopes for it. But in the end, I was kinda disappointed.
Story: The story was unique, I really liked the Zabuza arc, The villains were great. Chunin exams were entertaining and we got to see each of the Konoha 12 + plus some other ninjas show of their skills. Orochimaru vs 3rd hokage and the resurection of the first and second hokage got me really excited.  Overall 9/10
Art: The art was good, it wasn't anything amazing  but for animation made in the 2000's its pretty good.
Sound: I loved the soundtracks, They really fit
                  the whole ninja theme and overall got you excited for the next upcoming fights. Character theme songs/ soundtracks were also really good. Really like the sound the sharingan made when activated. Hand sign sound effects were also great. The voice acting was also great (Dub and Sub) Naruto is probably one of the best dubbed animes. When Gaara screamed "" It's my blood!"" it sent chills down my spine. 
Character: Naruto characters are great, Each side character got their own signature justu and other cool justus and skills BUT those skills are all wasted later on with lack of screentime. You've got characters like Kiba, Shino, TenTen, Rock Lee who are all super cool but you don't give them any screentime or development which completely ruines them. These guys didn't even get screentime in the fillers. In Naruto they only got the chunin exams to shine, after that they basically NEVER get screentime ever. 6/10
Enjoyment: I enjoyed Naruto when I was still at Sasuke retreveil arc but after that I didn't enjoy it as much because of the 80+ filler. And they filler wasn't even that good. The only one that was worth watching was the  Gotta see!Gotta Know! Kakashi-senseis true face! Even when we got some canon episodes after Sasuke retrieval arc they were all  filler/cannon.
Overall Naruto isn't a bad show but it wasn't that good either. It would of been better if they didn't have 80+ filler in a row and I really wished side characters got more moments to shine. overall 7/10",7
"
                Resting after surgery to prevent amputation of the left foot was an experience of agony and suffering.
 Away from work, friends, and the desire to continue to exist due to melancholic crises engulfing my states of mind, body and mind, I found in Naruto the peace therapy I needed. Watching 40 episodes a day, it was the drug that anesthetized my pain and entertained my loneliness.
Sometimes I felt like Rock Lee, a boy who due to a genetic disease is unable to be a normal ninja, but even so through absolute effort and dedication to training, he keeps his dream active through a will to
                  win. Or like Neji, who as a member of the warrior part of the Hyuuga clan is destined to serve the noblest part. Becoming someone indifferent to fate, until a punch to the chin changes his perspective.
Much empathy for the villains, who are often just children abandoned by their parents and adopted by their nations, as instruments of war due to their exceptional abilities.
 Kishimoto - author of the work - through his characters assumes the positions of father, grandfather, brother and or teacher. Naruto is a great deep motivational speech about how hard life is, and people need to have the strength to overcome it, which I needed at that time.
In Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, the ninja world is a constant war between humans and their traumatic lives. Orchestrated by battles of jutsu, kunais, shurikens, swordsmen, clashes of giant animals, colossal demons inhabiting the bodies of young people and a lot of flashback, while the soundtrack makes a point of tearing every tear from your eyelid or stretching every inch of your lip through smiles in moments of happiness.
The exaggeration in praising the relationship between Naruto and Sasuke with constant reruns and memories, good characters becoming extras, the inconstant animation and the exaggerated fillers weaken the brightness of their journey.
But it would be impossible, not to be grateful for the story and appreciate its great deeds and characters that welcomed me when I needed it most.
Thanks to my experience with Naruto in 2017, the 2020 quarantine is a simple Tentei compared to the great Maito Guy.
SINCE I WATCHED THE SHOW AS A ONE, ITS THE SAME REVIEW FOR BOTH ANIMES.",7
"
                As someone who has seen many anime shows i have to say this. Naruto is just fine,its not the greatest show ever but not the worst either. I can see comments regarding how only teens enjoy it and to be fair yes, but storywise i think its fine. Its a classic thats worth a watch these first Naruto series that is. Its better than shippuden that i personally havent finished yet but in retrospect have watched many of its episodes. For first timers it is probably a must since all newcomers are liking it, from there on they can watch better anime since they got
                  into it.",8
"
                I tried to stick with Naruto, I really did. I read the manga as a kid and loved it, in fact it was the first manga I ever read if I remember correctly. Despite that, I never really watched the show. But, years later, I decided to revisit a childhood favorite in a new medium and... jesus christ is this show slow. The characters are likeable, the overarching story is cool and interesting, but it takes so long to get there that it became agonizing to watch. 
It's so obvious that the show is constantly padding out the time especially in the fight scenes, which
                  move so slow that they're left with absolutely no tension or excitement. But it's not just the fights, the conversations between characters are so long and drawn out that they sound oddly robotic, repeating the same points over and over and taking awkwardly long pauses. To be fair I was watching the dub, so maybe that contributes, but you can only blame a dub for so much. The pacing of this show is flat-out terrible, not to mention the dozens of filler episodes I've heard about (but was planning to skip). I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that this story could've been told in like a third of the episodes, it would've tightened up the action, focused the show in a way I feel would be beneficial, and made it feel like so much less of a slog. And don't even get me started on the flashbacks. But at the end of the day a longer show run means more money so I guess I can see why they made these choices from a purely business standpoint.
Again, I wanted to watch this show. But 14 episodes in I just couldn't take the painfully slow pace anymore. If this was a 24 episode show or something then it wouldn't bother me, in fact I think a slower pace can be incredibly effective. But for hundreds of episodes... there are dozens of better shows I could be watching during that time. I think I'll stick to re-reading the manga instead.",6
"
                I'm going to attempt to write the most unbiased review of Naruto that I can. A disclaimer: This show has impacted my teenage years alot, and I hold a place for it in my heart. These are my thoughts after rewatching it recently (except for the filler - I will not be reviewing anything that doesn't pertain to the main story).
First, the story. This is one of its strong points, but I find that the quality of the story depends a lot on the arc. Some being better than others (for example, the Chuunin Exams is still one of my favourite arcs to this day),
                  and sometimes, it takes quite a dip. For example, the Tsunade retrieval arc was a little lackluster. Following Naruto on his journey to becoming hokage is classic and timeless plot, and seeing the genin grow together is well worth it.
As a side note, its unfortunate how much filler they crammed in that series - but if you follow an episode guide, you can easily skip the filler and still enjoy the story to the fullest.
The art is good, but...that's it. Just good. The studio really did their best and captured the essence of what Naruto wanted to show, but its obvious that some parts are a little rushed. Now the fight scenes - that's where the animation shines. I can understand if the overall style is a bit of a miss for some, but to me, its done its job, and shows a lot of character.
The soundtrack is of the things I can't find a fault in. The openings are catchy and energizing, the endings a little less so, but with an equal amount of soul in them. The music throughout the whole show is just really well composed, diverse, and a pleasure to listen to.
The characters are the most important part, in my eyes. There's a lot to say about them, and they easily carry the whole show. 
There's one big problem - the show's main characters, Naruto and Sasuke, are annoying. This might not be the case for everyone, but to me, they are both unrelatable, irritating, and covered with the heaviest plot armor I've seen by far. The show does a good job of making Naruto a little more sympathetic in the beginning (and he is far better in this show than he is during Shippuuden), but that is quickly lost in the waves of problems that he brings with him. Immature, taking some awful decisions, brash to a fault, and not always consistent in the way he's written. He frequently dismisses good advice, and while that may be part of his character and showing his flaws, I think it becomes difficult to like him after a while, even though we may find ourselves cheering for him to overcome hurdles and become stronger.
Sasuke's issues run deeper. He is unrelatable, arrogant, and though the show tries to make you sympathize with him, it does not work (especially towards the end). During the first few arcs and episodes, you might have a soft spot for him, because he's shown as more humane. But as time progresses and the anime shows clear favoritism, and his growth takes a very different turn...it's hard to like the guy, it really is.
What saves the show is all of the side characters - their interactions, their banter, their powers. There's a varied and memorable cast that carries the story on their shoulders, and even if you may not like the main characters, the rest will surely make up for it. I consider Sakura a part of the side characters for now, because she (sadly) doesn't become relevant until far later, and Shippuuden. Naruto isn't very good at writing female characters, but there's some gems that stand out, and that truly make you want to keep watching.
Despite how much I've dragged the show down, as a whole, its very enjoyable - as long as you skip the filler. There's some great messages about hard work and perseverance, about friendship and trust. If that sounds like your jam, I think you won't regret it.",8
"
                 A fantastic anime to watch. The story is strong and pulls you in, and makes you laugh along with all the action. Lots and lots of filler episodes though, which at times can be a little annoying, but its worth it. Almost anyone can find a character to relate to, or fall in love with. People go pretty crazy over the anime, its not the best in the history of its genre or anything, but it is worth watching =D
              ",9
"
                Naruto is a show that was kinda overhyped, but, I enjoyed it regardless, Naruto is a story about well Naruto, and it's a show with a ninja theme, dealing with the standard anime cast, the edgelord, the goofy mc, and the pissed off chick. 
The thing that surprised me most about naruto was the animation of the fights during the chunin exams, those fights were done fantastically, and it's just really fun to watch.
""really fun to watch"" is the perfect way to describe naruto, it's just shonen done really well.
The pacing wasn't really an issue for me, because i watched the re-cut version of the
                  show done by ocean, and that made the show really enjoyable, because pacing and filler was the main criticism given to naruto.
I'ts really good, and that's all I can say about it, the only criticism I can give to it is ""beliive it!"" becomes kinda annoying, and sasuke just acts like an edgelord cumstain in a lot of the first episodes.
overall-8/10",8
"
                Why give Naruto a 10/10? Nostalgia.
If I'm being honest with myself the show probably isn't that great in a vacuum. If I had been watching anime for more than a decade already, and then started watching Naruto when it came along, I don't know that it would have been something I'd latch onto and enjoy as much as I did. But I was in middle school, Dragon Ball Z had mostly run it's course and Naruto was the new hotness on the playground. Doing jutsu hand signs was the new kamehameha.
I liked Naruto well enough already but I think the Naruto Clash of Ninja games
                  on GameCube really helped bump it up there in coolness. I remember playing one of those at a Target on the display in the electronics section and getting hooked, before I ever even had a GameCube. When I finally got the game myself I would spend hours reenacting fights from the show in the game and thinking how cool it would be if it had more characters. I never had a PlayStation, so I didn't even know I was missing out on the whole Ultimate Ninja series. But wait this was a review about Naruto, not it's games.
Well it's just like I said, Naruto is really only good for me because of nostalgia. I just can't talk about it without talking about all the hype surrounding it and the impact it had.  I don't think I ever caught the whole story of Naruto in the early days, I would get strings of episodes here and there. I did have a pretty good idea of the overarching story, but I think the first time I really got to enjoy it all in one go was the so called Naruto Hundo marathon on Toonami. In August of 2007, I shattered just about every bone in my wrist on the first day of school, which happened to also be 2 days before my birthday. So it was that I spent my entire 13th birthday on a couch hyped up on pain meds watching Naruto. To celebrate the 100th episode airing on Cartoon Network, Toonami decided to run all 100 of them back to back non-stop for 2 days. I caught pretty much all of it, minus the time I had to spend sleeping, even though my older sister wanted to watch the premier of High School Musical 2, which I now hate for that reason.
Anyway all this to say that I was finally all caught up on Naruto plot and from that point on I was obsessed with always seeing the newest episode right when it aired. Around this time I also got my own computer that for the first time ever I wouldn't have to share with an older sibling, as well as internet access and a broadband connection. So now I could watch Naruto episode 119 part 1/5 on youtube and it only took 20 minutes of buffering beforehand. The late 2000's were a different time. While trying to find new episodes I ran into a bunch of ones that hadn't aired yet, but seemed like they were fake because they weren't even in English. My stupid 13 year old self didn't realize that this was a show that was being aired in Japan long before it ever got localized, and I was initially resistant to watching it in Japanese with subtitles on. I had never done that before with any show, so it was brand new experience. I got over it when I realized I suddenly had tons of episodes I could watch right away without having to wait for next week.
I binged them as fast as my slow internet and 9 hours a day at school schedule would allow. Probably took me a few years to get through those second 100 episodes. Oh look at me I'm rambling again about my personal experience with the show instead of the show itself. Well I'm almost done. I didn't realize what filler was at the time of watching. I just thought I had hit a part of the show that wasn't very good. I wondered constantly why nothing significant never seemed to happen, why Naruto never seemed to get any closer to finding Sasuke, which was a constant theme of the filler arcs. When I found out what exactly anime filler is and that I had been watching nothing but filler for months I was furious. I felt like I had been cheated out of valuable time. I understand now why it exists and the purpose it serves but I hated the never ending feeling of pointlessness to those arcs.
So pretending that the filler arcs don't exist, how does the story of Naruto hold up? The young boy from a village who wants to be the strongest and lead the village some day, the people he meets and the struggles he faces. It's a pretty typical coming of age story, and has one of the strongest first arcs in shounen in the Land of Waves arc. The Chuunin Exams introduce a great cast of characters and the best fight in shounen with Rock Lee vs Gaara. I think Lee is underutilized in the rest of the series and that the filler makes him look like the worst character ever, but that one fight makes him really shine. The Sasuke Retrival arc is great in letting some of the characters we've gotten to know really flex how reliable they can be. And that fight between Naruto and Sasuke at the Final Valley was so good that Kishimoto couldn't think of anything to top it for the manga's climax, so he just did it again.
All in all Naruto is a franchise that will always have a special place in my heart as my introduction to anime and my slow decent into weebhood. It was the great gateway anime of a generation, and you can't deny the impact it's had on the medium and the people who enjoy it. I've told my personal story with the series here and I'm sure thousands of others can attest similar experiences, and how the show shaped them into the degenerates they are today. 10/10 for being #1 of the big 3. 10/10 for being #1 in my heart. 10/10 for making weebs out of all of us.",10
"
                Not gonna lie, used to think this was a ten. This was my very first anime (I watched it when I was 10), and man did I think this was awesome (still kinda thinks its awesome). This is, in my opinion, the perfect entry-level anime. I still enjoy it, and I might even give this an 8, but I'm going to stick with a 7 for now. It definitely has a few issues, mostly the filler arcs or the battles that are way longer than they need to be. Oh, and the very few but messy animation flaws that take place in fast-moving sequences. There
                  are also many characters that are either blad, unhelpful, or just plain stupid and useless, but there are also characters that are inspiring, fun, and exciting. Overall, while I still hold it in a special place in my heart, I have to give it a 7/10.",7
"
                this is only my opinion 
Naruto is not a bad show but there are some things that make it average.
Story: I quiet enjoy story, Chunin Exams and Sasuke Recovery Mission are both great arcs and story fit perfectly, but there are filler episodes that does not do anything for story. Filler episodes are boring and horrible(episodes after sasuke recovery mission ). So that is for me 6/10.
Art: Nothing special and sometimes  just looks meh.
Sound: Some openings are  so good but it is not amazing.
Character: oh my god Only few characters in Naruto have development (Sasuke Gaara) but lot of characters are boring and
                  if they were not in show it will be the same (Shino, Kurenai)
Enjoyment/Overall : Naruto is my first anime and I enjoy it but you now  somethings is so good and something is trash.",5
"
                I remember being a small child and watching Naruto every weekend at breakfast, I even remember how after 500 years they played the first shippuden episode and I literally screamed.
Naruto was my first anime and probably the first thing that made look more into anime and watch things as a fan, as I had grown with anime but never watched it like a fan until Naruto came around, it was too my first manga, so I have a lot of love for this.
This first part on the story is the ""happy"" part, a bunch of kids being ninjas on general terms, it's very nice to
                  watch if you're looking for simply some nice anime to get into. All to be said, the writting of women could be ten times better, being the 90's-early 2000s it's no surprise it's pretty sexist, specially know Masashi Kishimoto didn't even cared about the women in the series, but if you can ignore that, everything else it's amazing, all the arcs are entertaining, there's so much comedy, but also sadness from the very start and I think it's just a nice anime, not perfect but nice!",9
"
                Started watching Naruto because my friends used to talk about it. It was good, I enjoyed the strategic fights and the chuunin exams,Naruto being a rebel and wanting acknowledgement. His goal as an mc seemed kinda selfish but since they brought up the issues in the narutoverse I was pumped to see what he does. 
Naruto's relationship with Sasuke is just not established well. He was being a whiny kid demanding his teammate to acknowledge him. He fails to understand Sasuke and his ways which is a huge SETBACK , in my opinion.
The female characters were just bad except Tsunade. The show preaches about friendship
                  but Ino and Sakura's relationship seemed toxic, so was naruto's and sasuke's I guess.
Overall, it was decent.",7
"
                Well it's been a lot of time since I finished Naruto. I should probably watch it once again to review it, but sincerely, I don't have the guts to do so.
I remember it being catchy at the time, I was a teenager and I related a lot to Naruto and his sensation of friendship towards Sasuke, his crush on Sakura, who in turn did like Sasuke but depised him and Hinata's crush on Naruto and his being to stupid to notice it. 
It was involving back then.
In hindsight, it looks like a pretty adolescent plot, which it is, so I think it fits better for
                  teenagers and indeed I think a teenager would like it.
I remember thinking about the art and the animation being of average quality back then, the plot interesting the protagonists where well developed throughout the anime's lifetime. However I think some characters were not well developed though.
Overall, a good anime which I was quite fond of at the time and it brings me good memories. Not too impressive though, I think it's an average anime on the whole.",7
"
                (This review does not contain my thoughts on the filler)
I went into this anime thinking that is was going to be majorly overhyped and the plot would be held together with duct tape and glue, but I was pleasantly surprised. 
The writing and characters within this anime are pretty great, definitely not the best, but I feel as if a lot of the motivations are pretty well conveyed. The character development, when it happens, is a bit simplistic, but I do feel like the lack of small improvements is made up for by some of the bigger developments, and analyzing subtle ways the characters act.
The
                  music is amazing, I have not heard an OST, opening, or ending that I didn't like. 
The art is pretty good, except for when it massively changes in quality for the worse. It definitely bugged me when it happened during some episodes, but the quality did ramp up later in the show.
Overall, great show, and it does live up to a decent amount of the hype surrounding it.",8
"
                I watched Naruto fully over the course of several months, as i was very turned off by some of the filler that was painfully boring, not to say that all the filler was boring, because some of the filler is actually entertaining when done right. 
The Story of Naruto was very entertaining up until the Naruto/Sasuke fight, which afterwards is basically filler until the final episode. My favorite arcs from the story were the Chunins Exams, (yes, i know its a tournament arc, but still) the Zabuza arc, and any arcs with Jiraiya. The story grinds to a halt after the fight in the final
                  valley and that is where the series turns into filler and it suffers as a result.
The Art is obviously not the best, as many have probably paused the show and seen some very questionable still frames of characters. The style of the show is still very recognizable which i feel sets it apart.
The Sound for the show is some of the best of heard. From the Fight music to the ""Sad Naruto Music"" the show excels in conveying the emotion of what is happening.
The Characters are great with the Main cast of Kakashi Hatake, Naruto Uzamaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno (not really her though.). The side characters also are very well adapted, as shown with the Sasuke Recovery Mission arc. The only character that really gets on my nerves is obviously Sakura. I know hating on Sakura is a tired out subject, but it is very true, everything she did in the series was basically whine about Sasuke or hit Naruto, while one of her character defining moments was cutting her hair.
I enjoyed Naruto a lot, despite its very apparent flaws and would recommend this to anyone wanting a long series to binge.",8
"
                Ayo! Naruto is thee anime! You either got into this through DBZ, Bleach, or One Piece. Everyone had their poison back then, and Naruto was mine. Although it isn't got me into anime, I would say it's what turned this into an addiction. 
To this day, when I see or hear ""Naruto,"" I get hit with a wave of nostalgia and all those feelings from the past start pouring in. Aside from the people who just binged Naruto on Netflix and make awful TikToks and shit, I honestly find it cringe, but it's all love at the end of the day. I'm not gonna act
                  like I didn't do that, if not worse, back then. Anyways, Naruto is thee show! A lot of love and care for this one",9
"
                I first watched Naruto in 2007. Before that I knew nothing about it or that it even existed, a friend of mine was the one who told me about it and encouraged me to watch it. In a way it was my first anime, if we disregard me previously watching Yu-Gi-Oh!, Shaman King, Princess Mononoke and A Wind Called Amnesia when I was too young to understand that these weren't just cartoons, but specific cartoons from Japan.
I was also influenced by people's opinions that I should skip the fillers of Naruto and never watch them, because they were pointless (allegedly).
Recently I decided to rewatch Naruto
                  with all the fillers that I missed and remember the show - is it as good as I remember or not. Previously I had rewatched One Piece (to a certain point) for the 3rd time and while it was my top #1 anime ever, after that I realized it had so many shortcomings I did not like and it stopped being my #1. Same happened when I rewatched Naruto - I encountered a lot of situations, which on my first watch I thought were very influential or important, but now - not so much.
As a kid I was obsessed with how cool and badass Sasuke was and thought Naruto was a lame pest. Now I saw it in reverse - Sasuke seemed like some confused edgy kid that tried to act cool and reserved while Naruto was earnest and trying his hard to do the best he can, this time I liked Naruto more and really disliked Sasuke for the choices that he has made and continues to make throughout the series.
One thing I missed was the fillers on my first watching. Now that I've seen all of them, I think it was a mistake to skip them, as they serve a really good purpose - they expand upon the world and define the supporting characters of Team Guy, Team Kurenai, Team Asuma in a way that can't be seen before. You learn a lot about their personalities, what they like or don't like. You have the episodes where Naruto is teamed with Hinata on missions and you can see how she feels about him a lot more. You have the episode where Shino is infected with a laughing poison and you see the most stern character laughing his ass off like a buffoon. You even think what it would be like to put the three most serious characters in one team - Shino, Neji and Gaara. You also see stuff like Kiba without his iconic hood, which many people including me thought was his hair (being black instead of being brown). You get to see other countries and in the last filler even the village of the Sand a little bit more. Even characters like Tenten and Chouji get attention.
After watching the fillers I appreciated the supporting characters a lot more and honestly learned more about them. I previously regarded them as some placeholders that existed just because, but now I managed to appreciate them a lot more. Because I haven't watched the fillers for a long time, I originally was under the impression that the Sand was not completely on friendly terms with the Leaf, but now I saw I was wrong.
Fillers aside, the story is kind of predictable and one thing I did not like about Naruto after watching One Piece after that was that most adventures in Naruto take place in either Konoha or the surrounding countries and then back and forth where in One Piece the characters travel the world and the scenery constantly changes, which is a lot better design, it happened in Hunter x Hunter and Yu Yu Hakusho too. Bleach also suffered from the same problem as Naruto - all the story takes place in the same few places and there just isn't a feeling of progress in either animes.
Overall I'm glad I rewatched Naruto completely without missing a thing, now I know I will not be coming to it ever again. I strongly recommend to everyone who hasn't seen it to watch it with the fillers as they expand the story even more. But Naruto in general is not that great of an anime or manga, it's mostly mediocre. It has so many inconsistencies, which can also be called plot holes. Like in some occasions the characters can use chakra to walk on walls, ceilings or water, but in others they have magically forgotten that ability and that's all due to the plot demanding it. In other situations you see technology like laptops and whatnot, in others you see people using Walkie-Talkies, but they still use birds to send messages to each other. These things create a great inconsistency not because it's hard to nail down what is the time period or technological advancement in the world of Naruto, but that things constantly change to suit the plot.
I think in the end Naruto does a good job at entertaining and certainly is the superior to Naruto Shippuden, which becomes a disappointment towards the end. I would advise people who haven't watched either to just watch Naruto and skip Shippuden, because it just keeps getting worse and the end is just retconning, because the creator literally lost the plot. After that there is an anime called Boruto, in the same universe, only like 30 years later. Stay away from that abomination at all costs - it is so bad, it will kill all you enjoyment you had from Naruto.",6

                I keep my reviews short, simple, and to the point for those of you who don’t want to read the rest of these essays. This show is a classic. If you like action, this is already worth watching. Everyone’s fighting style and powers are unique and fun, the world is interesting. Some of the characters are a little bland, but you will certainly have favorites. The story is also a little lacking, but for enjoyment and entertainment purposes I would recommended this to anyone, any day. The sound effects and music are awesome, the animation itself does the job, keep in mind this show started
                  airing in 2002. There are a lot of consecutive filler episodes at the end, and you can search up which ones those are and skip them if you so choose. I still enjoyed them however, so if you have the time and are having a good watch you should go ahead and see every episode, it’ll be over before you know it. Naruto is one of my favorites, though not one of my highest ratings.",8
"
                The story is based on Naruto's desire to become a hokage and Sasuke's desire to take revenge on his older brother. It is the best production with a ninja theme.
The battle scenes are fluid and the image quality is at a very good level. Color:10/10 Scenes:10/10 Action: 10/10 🔥 🔥🔥
Naruto has a funny and non-giving character, Sasuke has a cool and insensitive character. Gaara, Kakashi, Itachi and Shikamaru has strong characters. Sakura is... 😵
A production that very well describes the exclusion of people and the consequences that this entails. 
Filler is generally disliked because there are many episodes. Cannon episodes 1-130 / Filler episodes 130-200.

                ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***
This is one of my favorites Anime ever. The characters are written in depth. The main character continues to go through character development through entire series with each arc passing by. You won't even realize how much Naruto changes by the end of series until you compare them both by watching the series again because the changes are so subtle. You attach with characters as you can relate with them. This show brings so much emotion and you start to feel sad for even villains as you understand why they did all the bad things. It has very emotional moments like Jiraya's
                  death etc. This story deserves to get five stars until the pain arc, After that it goes downhill probably because the author had to push the series.
I began to browse through the reviews of Naruto, and realized something was horribly wrong. All the experienced anime watchers were giving it crappy reviews, and all the first-timers were giving it rave reviews, with reasons that every anime has to back them up. How could this be? Gee, I wonder. For some strange reason, Naruto has become the most popular and well-known anime series ever, and as such, it is usually the first anime seen by anime watchers alike. Why this is, I don't know. Maybe it appeals to a wide variety of young teenagers...
When I was 13 years old, I remember watching and loving this anime. I had never seen any other anime shows, and I thought the concept was original and amazing. When I found out that others animes literally had all that Naruto had plus a lot more, I was... bored with all the fillers. At the time the anime was great, but it really does get old.
Then again, the anime is not absolutely horrible. It has the essentials, with a somewhat unique story and art style. The characters are cliche, and enjoyment is there but short and sweet.
What I truly love about Naruto is the great soundtrack. It seems that all the OP and ED are just fabulous, and the music just fits within the series. I would have liked a bit of a change over the course of the show, but hey, it almost never happens.
All in all, it was a good show. Just good. It's OK, but ive definitely seen better.",8

                Spoilers for Naruto Chapter 1 and Anime episode 1----|
Naruto 
This was my ever anime I had ever consumed and boy was I enjoying that shit.
The characters, fights, story, and enjoyment were amazing. The way I felt about the characters felt genuine.
In this review i'll be talking about the points that really stood out to be in Chapter 1 of Masashi Kishimoto's Naruto Story.---| 
Pre Conflict with Mizuki--|
Naruto as a kid was Hated by the village that he couldn't control. They hated him because of what was inside him. They hated him out of fear. They feared what was inside him, judged him by what was
                  inside him, a monster (to them). But didn't see him for what HE was. They hated him because he posed a threat to them. he could kill everyone at the village at any moment. They saw him as Kurama and not as Naruto Uzamaki. Even the one closes to him at the time Iruka had some deep faint hatred for Naruto seeing him as the nine tailed fox and not as them being separate beings. He hated him because of what Kurama did to Iruka's parents, Iruka thinking they we're the same being. Bringing me to my next point, The fight against Mizuki.
The fight against Mizuki---|
When Iruka found out Naruto had stolen the sacred scroll he was disappointed. Only seeing the conflict through the eye's of what Mizuki had planned. To make it ALL blamed on Naruto, even though his life was already shitty. But the second Iruka realized it was Mizuki who used Naruto emotions of wanting to be not hated by the village to get him to steal the scroll. He saw Naruto has someone else, not the nine tailed fox. But as Naruto Uzamaki, as a Human. During the battle Iruka saved naruto, Showing that he believed that Naruto could become Hokage. IMO that's what really showed naruto that it was time to get to work. to achieve his dreams.
Notes--|
Be honest did any of you actually read that? if you did, i appreciate it 
I'll MAYBE make a full review and analysis on the full series.
Discord:  zero.#6063
ily 
Im back
Chapter 2 and Anime episode 2--|     
(Im probably not going to do this for every chapter btw)
Intro with Konohamuru--|
Konohamuru Is Introduced as someone  who is only known for his family, not for him. He was always known for him being the 3rd Hokage's grandson and not for being Konohamuru.
Konohamurus and Narutos meeting--|
When Naruto held him by the neck He was treating him like a normal person. When Ebitsu Told Naruto that he was the 3rd Hokage's Grandson, he didnt care. He punched Konohamuru. Konohamuru was surpised that he didnt care about who he was in blood, but who Konohamuru was as him, Konohamuru.
Why Konohamuru wanting Naruto has a teacher--|
Konohamuru wanted naruto has his mentor rather than Ebitsu was Most likely in my eyes was because Naruto saw him has just a brat, a normal person. The first person to, everyone treating Konohamuru like he was amazing because of his granpa.
That's it. tbh honest i was kinda lazy. see ya guys at the next review <3",8
"
                I'll preface this with an explanation of why I even started watching Naruto. A bunch of my friends grew up watching it and held it in a very high regard. Respecting their opinion I decided to give it a chance, even after reading a bunch of reviews saying it's not that great.
That aside I really went into it with an open mind, since I didn't want my countless hours spent watching a show to be thrown away. I'll also add I skipped all of the filler/non canon episodes and to give it a real good chance watched the countless (they seriously are countless) flashbacks on
                  2x speed.
I'll start of with my honest opinion. The show in it's entirety was a a big disappointment. There are plenty of reasons as to why and I'll go through them in this review but one that should be stated separately is the following. It's massively over-hyped. Because of that I truly expected a masterpiece which made me feel let down watching it. People hold it on this insanely high pedestal and it just isn't nearly as good. Don't get me wrong it isn't super bad and I understand why people like it. It's nostalgic to a lot of people and that tends to skew their opinion. I don't want to judge people for really loving it. There is a lot to love especially if, as I said it's a nostalgic thing.
However objectively it has too many flaws.
Story:
The general story and idea for Naruto is really really good. That's one of the reasons why I succumbed and started watching it. But then you watch it and it starts going to s***.
Most of the reasons that drive the main story line become more ridiculous and forced as you watch. A lot of the other things that bother me with it, belong in the characters rating so more about it there.
Art:
Good god I don't know what crack the animators were on but the amount of shoddy frames still hurts me. I've watched plenty of anime some even older than Naruto and I love old school style, but this was just really really s*** at times. The original material is good but some of the drawings done by whoever made them are hell spawns. It makes for some great memes so I'll let it slide but really it hurts the show since Naruto will turn into a freaking mouse during a serious emotional fight and I'll just end up laughing like an idiot instead of being engrossed in the action.
Sound:
One of the strong points of the Naruto franchise. I listen to some of the music from the show anyway so I was inclined to give it a 10. The lower score is because the use of it, is sometimes out of place and ruins some scenes. But overall can't really complain too much there.
Character:
Much like the story, the characters also have plenty of plot holes and a ton of other problems.
I won't go into too many details to not spoil anything but. The characters motives are all really badly set and their development is missing. Nothing really happens in this entire season and everything that does is highly nonsensical. As a result it's very hard to feel any real emotional attachment or involvement.
Enjoyment:
What carried Naruto for me was solely the fact that I like the genre.
Overall:
After going through everything in my mind, writing this review I realized it doesn't deserve such a high rating maybe I should really knock it down to 5, but I'll let it slide. There were some heartfelt moments, during which I got engaged even for a second enough to give it a 6, albeit against my objective opinion. As I said I get why people like it for nostalgic reasons, but I seriously won't stand here doing nothing when people say it's better than x anime. It's the worst shonen I've watched but not the worst anime so there's that.
I will be watching Shippuden since I know there's a lot a really well animated fight scenes there, but I'm dreading to see how badly the story turns out. Since I've started watching so late,
I unfortunately know some of the main plot points and I can't say I'm excited to see them play out but I'll keep at it just so I can even more confidently say it's not as good as people say it is.",6
"
                I had very high expectations for the show but it all went down the drain. The starting of the the show was good and it kept on inclining in at a constant pace, that was the case for the first hundred episodes. But after that there wasn't anything particularly new added to the show and it kept on repeating the main characters(Naruto) daily life in the same order, that is everyday Naruto started with a mission, faces the enemies with the same attacks over and over again, gets beaten by them several times and finally somehow manages to clutch the fight(BTW Naruto is dense as
                  f**k). Naruto doesn't do anything new and only has 2 or 3 tricks up his sleeves. so if you are reading this, i recommend you skip most of the episodes and only focus on the main ones.
P.S the only plus point i'd give is that, the show will make you laugh once in a while.",6
"
                I skipped all of the filler in Naruto season one and I think it's mainly because of this that I've rated it so highly.  Were there annoying Perry moments with harem jutsu? Yes.  Were there pacing problems? You bet.  Were almost all the female characters shallow and one dimensional? You know it.  But in spite of all that, the story of brotherhood, dreams and perseverance shone through.  You can't help but root for the underdog in this story; so much of what is to come in shippuden is set up here and to be honest, in some ways I prefer
                  the heart of the original.  The staple of Naruto for me, is that love it or hate it - everybody has an opinion, and noone is indifferent.  The blonde haired tween ninja makes us all feel SOMETHING, and that's a rare thing to be universal nowadays, especially since I watched it without nostalgia factoring in.  If you have the time to spare, it's a staple of anime, and you should definitely give it a watch.",9
"
                Naruto... You know, I'm probably very behind-the-times in reviewing this show, but because I like doing this AND in honour of getting to the halfway point in the original show (110/220), I'mma gonna do this. Let's jam suzies:
General comments: What more can be said about this show man! Love him, hate him, best show ever, worst show ever, you can't deny the impact of this show. In fact, it would probably be the dragonball of this word had dragonball not been created. (Or One Piece...) Why does it work? Ninjas. EVERYONE knows you either fall on the pirate side or the ninja side. After dabbling
                  in AC4, I'd have to go pirates, BUT - Hidden Villages. Ninja techniques. High-octane martial arts action. Gravity-defying jumps and aerobics. Just, NINJAS.
Art: I like the art. Despite being a ""new"" show, it's ALL hand-drawn, and reflects the manga of which the show is based on very well.  What more can you say, very traditional and timeless.
Sound: I actually didn't like the sound that much. Repititive yet unmemorable. Who knows, everyone is different, but the opening and ending changed every 20 or so episodes, and there was, like, little jingles when the mundane things came on where... Filler really, no important dialogue etc.
Character: Oh GOD. SO MANY. I'll do a brief bio of the main people.
Naruto: I can't believe, to this day, Naruto is the only shoujin main character who I actually really like! He's comical... In fact, funnily enough, he IS the comic relief character, but also the main guy. He's actually got the spirit of the nine-tails fox sealed inside him (ACTUAL Japanese folklore) , and, dunno, just awesome!
Sakura is Naruto's love interest, despite being in love with Sasuke (who I'll get too in a bit.) Oh, did I mention everyone is, like, 14?! Just throwing it out there. Unfortunately, Sakura fills the usual woman role. Apart from she's 10x more boring. Just, come on, make her do something otger than cook, heal and be a love interest! A story arc of herself would be awesome! Sasuke: Sasuke makes up the rag-tag team as the arrogant yet cool kid that everyone wanted to be at school. He gets pretty interesting around 30/40's episodes in, we learn about him, and he gets bit by the main baddy that essentially gives him this ""disease"" that allows him to go berserk, adding to his impressive ninja skills. Despite being arrogant and ""that knob"", I liked Sasuke!
Kakashi: Kakashi rounds this all off, as he is the teacher of the ""squad"" of Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke. He's like the teacher everyone wanted. He's so layed back (he reads while just casually hanging, from his feet, off a tree) and is both cool and cool-headed. He also has the Sharingan ability, as does Sasuke, which allows them both to essentially predict a future move and act accordingly. Kakashi is my favourite character. 
Lee: Lee's special in that he can't concentrate his Chakra (ninja-power in essence) and so has to rely on martial arts. Because of this, however, many people IWIH ninja techniques can't touch him. He's fast, but strong. He's the character that shows *caring voice* everyone can achieve if they try! Excuse me while I go through up...
Shikamaru, Chouji and Ino essentially make up the ""neo-Naruto"" squad, Ino = Sakura, Shikamaru = Sasuke, and Chouji is just the fat kid. So in no way similar to Naruto, still... They're both wierd/odd? The Sound ninjas are the enemy village of Narutos village, and Orochimaru is essentially you're main baddie. If I've missed out so many, fan favourites even, but there's just TOO many characters. Many do just have a side-role anyway.
Verdict: So yeah, I bloody liked this show! Well, still do. It's basically mindless ninja fun (though, it's ninjas, so not completeley mindless) and just high-octane stuff. Really, if you haven't checked it out, why?! Where have you been? But, seriously, do - unfortunately, Naruto is like marmite, splits opinion, but if you love it, you're in for one hell of a ride. Just don't start Shippuden. It's like looking at a mirror through a mirror haha...",9

                Story:
Naruto is about ninjas. It has alot to do with power and obtaining power and such. The villians are people that try to obtain power that they shouldn't have. I love the story of Naruto actually, mainly the pacing at which it develops. Everything is rather slow and expanded which somewhat makes it boring yet at the same time it keeps your attention. A bit like death note, where they make small things seem very significant and go into a ton of details that you supposedly shouldn't care about yet you get into it. The whole purpose of writing this review is to let people
                  know they should watch this, and that Shippuden is soooo much worse. The pacing of Shippuden is done somewhat like Naruto, but they clearly try too hard to make you care, too many characters that later become unimportant. It's hard to pinpoint what exactly, but the main thing is that they try too hard to be like original Naruto, go overboard, and end up boring. I give the story an 8/10 only because sometimes it develops a bit tooo slowly, and 70+ filler episodes isn't exactly my favorite thing, especially since I didn't even realize they were all filler until the end....
Art:
Nothing to talk about. Creative but not beautiful or genius design. They try to make each character different and succeed without seeming too generic. SHIPPUDEN ON THE OTHER HAND, while they succeed in making characters different, some of them are just plain silly. Sometimes the slightly generic quality allows the character to seem normal, but in shippuden characters like killer bee and his annoying rhymes, pain and all those piercings.....you just can't imagine them being in the normal Naruto, right? So in a way, while they are more creative, they don't fit the boundaries of creative and end up unusual, and also take away the character of the show. 
Excluding characters, the backgrounds have become extremely lazy, and Naruto also doesn't look badass anymore.
I give the art an 8/10, because there's nothing particularly great or bad in it, but Shippuden is a huge downgrade, and alot of their ""creativity"" just leads to the show being out of character from the original.
Sound:
Soundtracks are always awesome, both Original and Shippuden. I like quite a few of the openings. 8/10
Character:
It ends up being like a typical anime, where you like the protaganists and dislike the villians. Like I said above, characters are all creative and different but sometimes try a little too hard to do so. I however, think Naruto is totally awesome in the original. Even with his annoying and ""knucklehead""-ness it's kind of hard to not like him, especially because of the way they make all his enemies seem like heartless douchebags. SHIPPUDEN ON THE OTHER HAND, turns even the 9-tailed fox into a kids show character(though I suppose it is a kid's show). They (unforgivably), suddenly turn Naruto into the strongest Ninja ever, first making him a rather normal/strong ninja due to tons of training, and then adding on weird powers like sage mode and bijuu mode or something. Maybe if they added less crazy, new level-up-like, abilities and just focused on making him more special instead of all those rasengans you'd like him a bit more. And everytime they focus on sasuke they just make him out to be more of an idiot. The fact that he's even getting stronger in the first place annoys me a ton. Worst of all is gonna have to be the development in all the hokages/hoshikages/etc. i don't even know the names but you know what i mean.....they all end up weaker than naruto(?) and characterless lame-os that somehow end up working together? I don't understand, but I think they're thrown in simply because the world of Naruto has them. So back to the original, it's hard to dislike any main characters/protaganists, but very often they have trouble developing the character and sometimes just throw them in the background to do the main character's dirty work. HOWEVER, there are great moments, like in the sasuke retrieval arc, where each ninja does his own thing and it's just really awesome. I give characters 8/10, because they are inconsistent, but when it's good it's good. In shippuden it's basically never good.
Enjoyment:
IT'S ENJOYABLE. IT'S FUNNY/DRAMATIC/AWESOME/EXCITING. WATCH IT. Shippuden on the other hand completely lacks the funny part(they still try), the drama is unnecessarily silly, the awesomeness is pretty much all gone, and rarely things are exciting because all the battles are focused on silly details no one cares about. 9/10 for original
Overall: 9/10. Everyone should watch this anime, despite it's not-so-good parts simply because it's friggin Naruto. And I can't stress more that Shippuden is a complete failure and that if it somehow kept to the original characterwhile developing it might've become one of the best anime out there",9
"
                I know I'm probably gonna get hate for saying this, but Naruto is really mediocre to me. The story gets stale after a while, and the animation quality is poor.
The biggest negatives of Naruto is its animation, and its story. The art style of the manga really didn't translate well into animation at all, and the plot gets boring. Some of the episodes are just the characters talking for 23 minutes, and that's it. People don't just want to see characters talk and not move at all for 23 WHOLE minutes. They want to see something else, like battles.
The battles in Naruto are lame. I'd
                  probably like them more if the animation was a lot better, but its not. There's too many battles, to the point where we can't breathe. And the worst part is, THEY'RE ALL MEDIOCRE.
While you might think that I completly despise Naruto, I do still think it has some positive qualities. The music in Naruto is really catchy, and the characters are also very interesting. Heck, if the story wasn't so plain and stale, I'd probably really care about all the characters just like I do with Hunter x Hunter.
To sum this review up, Naruto is a boring anime. It does have its few good qualities, but they're mostly overshadowed by the negative ones. 5/10",5
"
                hes a nonce thats for sure, he has a nonce sealed inside him cus hes a nonce nonce and he can use the nonces spiritual energy to fucking nonce on everyone
he has orange hair because hes a proper nonce, he kills everyone he meets because hes a nonce, he can summon a toad because hes weak af, hes not cool at all he isnt like jiraiya he was a sexy boy and was cool and strong and funny, but naruto isnt any of these things so hes pretty useless all around, no one likes him everyone likes jiraiya and when he leaves for no reason
                  everyone gets sad",8
"
                i would have given it an 8 if it was like 20 episodes total. but it's not. literally everything from episode 12 to 20 can be summarized in one episode if you cut out the flashbacks and filler bullcrap.
I play some parts on 4X speed and everything else on 2X speed. still feel like i wasted my time watching this.
now that that's out the way, let's talk about the art. it starts off looking good, then the freaking mist appears. and it looks like your monitor is dirty. the white spots don't move at all, the colors get faded a little, and that's how the
                  show goes on for like 6 episodes. looks awful.
I happen to be a video Editor using final cut, and there's this one filter in final cut pro called ""cross hatch"" and every flashback is literally a piece of otherwise very good looking art that's ruined by this god awful effect that's slapped on top. I bleed from my eyes every time someone remembers something that happened in the mist. two shitty filters put on top of each other, completely ruining the art.",4
"
                (Not entirely spoiler free)
I've never watched Naruto before and I finally did it after I've been told by hundreds of people to give it a shot. Even non-Anime fans have watched it, people who usually never watch any kind of Anime and there's definitely a reason for that. It's easy to watch, it's not overcomplicated and attracts a broad audience. For many people Naruto was their childhood but I personally have never watched a single Naruto episode before starting Naruto classic in February 2022. I was born in 2003 and usually only watched Pokémon during my childhood, never caught a single Naruto episode on TV.
                  But honestly, now that I've completed everything, I wish I could introduce my younger self to Naruto.
Quick note: I've skipped the fillers, I'll watch them as soon as I'm done with Shippuden.
Story 7/10:
Now the story of Naruto isn't something overcomplicated, it's straight and simple, but very inspiring at the same time.
The first arc's pacing felt odd to me, it was pretty slow for my taste which lead to a not so good first impression of Naruto as an Anime on me. But well, I kinda still went with it since I still wanted to give it a chance, thinking that it might improves later on. And it did. With the Chunin exam arc I started to really enjoy Naruto, there were some slower parts here and there but it didn't bother me as much as in the first arc. I don't think I have to talk about Lee VS Gaara because everyone already knows how good this fight was. Lee dropping his weights has to be one of the best scenes in the entire classic series.
Now after Orochimaru attacked the village (which was also a good arc), we see Jiraiya and Naruto going on a trip to find Tsunade. It was also the arc Naruto first learned to master the Rasengan and it also got kinda slow there. But it was still fun to watch Naruto and Jiraiya, since I think they both make a very entertaining duo. But what actually caught my attention was the first appearance of Akatsuki, and since I literally saw Akatsuki's logo EVERYWHERE before watching Naruto, I had high expectations of them so I was really excited to see them in action for the first time.
Okay but now, probably my favorite canon arc of Naruto classic: the ""Save Sasuke"" arc. I loved the Shikamaru-Naruto-Neji-Choji-Kiba team up so much and the entire vibe of the arc. It showed Shikamaru's great potential as a team leader, Choji & Kiba had time to shine and NEJI. Holy I loved his fight against spider guy. It slowed down towards the end / I kinda lost interest at the last few episodes of this arc buuut it still had a really strong start. Everyone loves the Naruto VS Sasuke fight, but I think I didn't enjoy it as much since I was really mad at Sasuke at that time for his behavior (that's where I started to dislike his character). It was still good though, but I had to accept the fact that Sasuke went crazy and won't be on Konoha's side for a very long time - and it upset me a lot lol. BUT - since I reached the end of Naruto classic (skipped the fillers for now), I was SO excited to finally start Shippuden and get to the juicy part of the entire Naruto series.
The reason I gave the story a 7/10 is because I think it was good but nothing outstanding.
Art: 6/10 
Naruto's art itself is fine, the animation was kinda poor most of the time though - most likely because it was a long running show. There were definitely some really well animated fight scenes (Lee VS Gaara, Sasuke VS Naruto) but most of the time it was - questionable. I'm sure everyone has already seen videos with the title ""Never pause Naruto"" and well yeah, I think it's self-explanatory, though I must say it created a lot of great memes. I personally think the art style of Naruto is nice, I like it, but it's not truly amazing compared to other art styles I've seen already. But well, this is a really subjective topic. Art: solid and fine, animation however, just okay to meh with some exceptions.(Another point: I think Sasuke's phase 2 form is just terribly designed, I'm sorry- like what's with these hand-wings coming out of his back and his hair style and weird lipstick??- I wasn't able to take him serious)
Sound: 9/10
I absolutely LOVE Naruto's OST, it's honestly one of the best things about the show. The openings? Bangers. The endings as well. My favorite openings have to be Opening 4 and 5, with 5 being my all time favorite. I just loved the vibe of the opening, the boys naruto-running was so nice to watch at the start of every episode of the arc. The OST during emotional scenes and fight scenes were always fitting and it underlined the atmosphere of a scene. Absolutely loved it, a 9/10 for me.
Characters: 8/10
Naruto has some amazing characters with a lot of potential, there are a handful of likable characters and characters who grew on you throughout the show.
I personally love Naruto as a protagonist, he obviously had to go through a lot of hardships but still manages to be a ball of sunshine with idiotic/chaotic energy, which I love about him. He isn't a ""complicated"" thinker and sometimes has a hard time understanding more complicated topics, but I think that's what makes him so charming. Him chasing after his dream and not letting anyone ruin his dreams makes him a really good role model. It's really inspiring to know that he still goes his own path even though people underestimated him, treated him badly during his childhood and he was sad and alone all the time, an outsider. You build sympathy for him right at the beginning and were happy for him when he finally found people who accepted & loved him the way he is.
Sasuke. Oof. I liked him at the beginning but I still prefered Naruto over him, but my image of him got worse at the end of Classic. His character itself makes sense and I know where he's coming from - but I just don't like him at the moment. It might change in the future but I just didn't like how he behaved near the end. He turned into such an arrogant person all of the sudden.
Now the side characters: there are some amazing side characters (Gaara, Lee, Neji, Shikamaru, the list goes on), but I'm just kinda sad that they don't show everyone's full potential. Especially some of the female characters. I personally think they're very flat compared to other characters, probably also because they didn't get as much screen time. Like, I don't know what's going on with Ino, Tenten and Sakura. Sakura did literally almost nothing in Classic even though she's the female protagonist which I found very sad. I know she gets better in Shippuden, but she was pretty much useless in Classic and she honestly deserves better ESPECIALLY because she's the female protagonist. I just wished they got more attention from the author.
Also, Neji is definitely my favorite. Hinata as well (mostly because I kin her and I just really like her), other characters that I absolutely loved were Shikamaru and Lee. 
The characters still get a 8/10 from me because I know they have potential and there were still some really likable characters and well developed ones. I'm just disappointed with some of the female characters.
Enjoyment: 9/10
I fully enjoyed Naruto. After I got through the first arc I truly had a lot of fun watching Naruto every evening after a long school day, just lying in my bed and watching some episodes before going to sleep. It was the best feeling. I really love some of the characters and they + the OST/Openings/Endings made the Anime really enjoyable for me.
Overall: 7/10
I don't want to give it a 8/10 because I feel like Shippuden is gonna get a 8/10 or higher. It's certainly not the best Anime I've watched but it still was fun to watch and enjoyable. It made me understand why so many people still love this Anime so much - it's something I would even show my future children because I think it's a show that can inspire and motivate them to do their best to achieve their dreams and to never give up.",7
"
                So I basically started watching because of a girl.
At first glance it seemed interesting, I had heard mixed opinions though, but some just straight up seemed to be in love, so I thought why not give it a try, the potential definitely seemed to be there.
Now being childish doesn't necessarily need to be a bad thing, and it sure might give it a tone that makes you feel overall comfortable/cozy, but the dangers are extremely high.
It definitely might get a bit boring or uncanny sometimes and usually there are some shitty moments.
But it didn't take long, and she seemed to be losing interest, so it
                  probably wouldn't have lasted any worthy time anyway.
(the show kinda has the same issues btw)
She also suggested Samurai Champloo, so maybe I'll fall in love solely with the image I have and mature on a seemingly endless chase for it.",6

                Naruto: My Honest Review
Naruto was the second anime I had ever watched, and it was really the first anime that caught my attention regarding anime as a whole. When I watched it, it instantly became my favorite show, taking the spot from Dragon Ball Z easily. Compared to the first anime I had watched, it was an immediate step up: I was mesmerized by the story, endeared by the characters, and in awe of the battles. Naruto is still a part of the big three original shonen anime but is it really worth the popularity that it gets?
I first watched this show when I was
                  nine years old, in 2018. Recently, I have re-watched Naruto and have changed my opinion on it as a whole. I realized that since watching Naruto many other anime have simply been better.
The series follows Naruto, a boy living in the village hidden in the leaf, in a world full of shinobi. Twelve years prior to the start of this series, a nine-tailed beast attacked the village. Even the full force of the Village could not contain it until the Fourth Hokage saved the village by sealing the fox within his newborn baby son, Naruto. Though, this caused the Fourth Hokage to die, and thus rendered Naruto an orphan. The story is quite sad, as Naruto is treated as the Demon Fox, though he does not even know that until he is twelve years old, and graduating from the Ninja Academy.
Whilst the show suffers from the same thing as many older shonen titles do, pacing- It still carries a memorable story. For me, the story really picked up during the Land Of Waves Arc, as we got introduced to the cruelty of the Ninja world. However, the fact that many episodes were made from single chapters constricts the story from being enjoyable.
The Three Main Characters are not relatable and are not very good as a whole.
Naruto is extremely annoying, and is quite frankly an idiot- a trend with shonen male main characters, he is made stupid. Sakura is even more so an idiot and is entirely useless throughout the show. Sasuke is a boring character and is not very likable.
However, the character i believed saved the beginning of the show from boredom, is Kakashi.
Whilst not having very good characters, Kakashi and Itachi stand out from the others.
The arc within this Arc is not very notable, either, though not much can be said, as it is an old show within itself.
Next up, the Chunin Exams Arc was probably my favorite in the entire show. Here, we are introduced to the major villain of the series, Orochimaru, who, within the beginning of this Arc, commits a deed that carries itself out until the end of the show, and into a majority of the second part, Shippuden. The art was kicked up a notch and fights like Sasuke vs. Orochimaru, and Rock Lee vs. Gaara has some of the best animations in the entire show.
Though, after this arc is finished, and the minor villain Gaara is defeated, the show goes downhill from there.
After this, follows a short arc with no upgrades from the first arc, and no memorable fights, listed as Search for Tsunade Arc. Once this arc is finished, it's followed by nearly a hundred episodes of filler. You heard me right, one hundred episodes. Throughout this only one or two arcs are actually bearable, and the rest are just your average horrible filler.
The series is finished by actually quite an enjoyable arc, with many great fights, such as Naruto vs. Sasuke. However, I still rank the chunin exams arc above this.
I won't spoil anything further about the show. I would highly recommend it if you are into a semi-dark action packed show about ninjas, but other than that, it's an average show.",7
"
                Naruto is another in a long-line of popular shounen battle anime in its focus on the titular, simple-minded and obnoxious titular character desiring to become his village's leader through hard work and perseverance despite being a societal outcast because of being the human host for a demonic fox. Essentially, whatever typical shounen action anime tropes you can think of apply to much of what Naruto has to offer up from the titular character being a worst case of the simple-minded hero character than Dragon Ball's Goku, Sasuke being the revenge-seeking loner, Sakura the short-fused kunoichi with a single-minded interest in Sasuke, powerful sage Jiraiya being
                  yet another dirty old man, and so forth. It also has some of the typical battle arc tropes of the genre such as Naruto and others seeking to grow stronger, a battle tournament, and a main villain attempting to wipe out the heroes throughout a good span of the series.
The series does make its attempts at offering depth to its story and characters. It explores a number of the consequences that the ninja lifestyle has with affecting a number of characters that include the mental toll being a demonic host takes on Gaara and Orochimaru's quest for seeking knowledge on all ninja techniques leading him to continually manipulate others in his schemes. The development of Sasuke's character also leads to what is considered one of the franchise's best arcs with the Sasuke Retrieval arc when the orphaned Uchiha takes on his own plans to seek the revenge he wants. These more serious developments do lead to the mentioned obnoxious traits of the characters to be dialed back a bit as the series progresses, which leads it to actually be a little more engrossing as a result.
Unfortunately like many titles of its ilk, Naruto does eventually find itself getting into filler arcs because of catching up with its manga source material. This especially gets bad after the end of the Sasuke Retrieval arc when the remaining 85 episodes of the series consist of nothing but filler thus leading the advancing plot to be dragged to an abrupt halt and be left incomplete until Naruto Shippuuden comes along. The fillers do make attempts at trying to develop some characters who otherwise didn't get much exposure in the series proper, some of this working well with Sakura and Hinata. But for the most part, the fillers are otherwise non-essential viewing thanks to their self-contained and anime-exclusive developments, and you could just as easily skip past them if you only wanted to watch the series up to the Sasuke Retrieval arc.
In terms of artwork, scenery and character designs are reasonably detailed and well drawn though nothing out-of-the-ordinary for a 2000s anime. It makes use of a good number of animation shortcuts thanks to its long length, but has its occasional fluid movements in some of the anime's pivotal fights that include the climactic fight between Naruto and Sasuke during the Retrieval arc. Opening and ending musical tracks mostly milk use of J-rock and J-pop tracks, but the insert tracks consist of some catchy traditional beats with the use of drums, chanting, and instrumentation.
While having its occasional moments of quality, Naruto still does ultimately suffer from a number of the typical pitfalls of the shounen action anime genre from its rehashing of the typical character and storyline elements of the genre, frequent use of animation shortcuts, and having a good helping of filler arcs. I would only recommend this title if you are a big fan of similar long-running shounen action titles like DBZ or Bleach.",5

                this is a short spoiler free review ;D
First of i think you should watch this 
The Story: we have  naruto witch is a little brat but he slowly getsome great comrades and he get some AMAZING development so the fillers are bad with the art and the bad characters but after about 135 i think you can skip the rest sof the show its just fillers
The Art and Sound: The art can be kinda bland and boring sometimes but this was 2002, but dont worry when theres a big event the drawing squad gose super saiyan and the art is some unlike you have
                  seen before, the sound just wow the sound tracks really captures the feel of that moment, plus i just have some many openings and track remembered thanks to this anime u will have some to i almost swear
Characters: As i have said the development if naruto is amazing, by episode 50 we have most of the cast like team 7 and the sand jiraya and many more, we also have that imo anyoning bond between sakuske and naruto, but over all the charaters are Great
The things i dislike: the anoying filler and the stupid naruto motivation to sauske.
Overall the filler can really drag down the series but you can just skip them if you want but other wise i think this is a Great series and that you should watch it :D",8
"
                — Canon arcs were solid, except for the unnecessary recycled flashback spams at times which really annoyed me, if I'm being honest. Sasuke Retrieval Arc could easily have been a solid 10 had it not been for the Naruto vs. Sasuke on rooftop flashbacks for like a million times. However, the progression was great & it always leaves you at a state where you'd be asking for more & more. Enjoyably intriguing, to say the least!
— Filler arcs, on the contrary, were inconsistent throughout with no evident tonal difference, which was a great aspect. Some were great, some were good, some were mediocre & some
                  were flat-out boring. However, the filler arcs explored the characters, provided them some sort of growth & surfed the world pretty well! But whether the events & developments remain intact remains to be seen. I'd be happily surprised if some of the filler arcs are addressed in the future! That said, the one-shot fillers were mostly hilariously great! Wish if they did those much more than what they did otherwise.
— All the characters were great. However, the vast developments were mostly dedicated towards Sasuke & Naruto. Sakura, for example, barely had any major significance or impact. Hinata too barely appeared in the canon arcs, with all the ""crush"" & stuffs there was to show. On the other hand, many characters particularly required no such development & were really likeable! Naruto's charm made him the best character of the show pretty easily. Although, Kakashi, Jiraiya, Tsunade, Lee, Guy, Gaara & Shikamaru were few of the others I liked too! Character designs were also as lovely — Naruto, Iino, Sakura, Sasuke, Itachi, Kakashi, Tsunade, Jiraiya, Kiba, Neji, Shikamaru, Choji, Shino & Anko's designs specifically were my favourites!
— Comedy was spot-on. Even though some of them were repetitive at times (Jiraiya sneaking in on women, Lee drunk, etc), they always felt hilarious! My favourite gag was Kakashi's excuses for getting late though!
— World-building felt solid & really interesting at times, but nothing was particularly explored to the extent where it could be judged thoroughly. The fillers could've done a better job, under the supervision of the Mangaka, at this one instead of just throwing off random locations.
— Action was brilliant for most of the part, from choreography, to shot composition & animation! Especially in the canon arcs. The power system however wasn't mind-blowing or something but was simplistic & that's where its strength was! Although what held back the action's full potential was the storytelling structuring, in my opinion. For example, One Piece usually sorts out a huge chunk of flashbacks before the real fight begins. But for Naruto, it's the opposite. The start-stop-start-stop action is something I didn't exactly like, as it all comes down to preference after all.
— Off-the-fights animation, on the contrary, was inconsistent throughout just as the art. Sometimes, the characters looked too round or sharp, with the backgrounds being good or mediocre. Animation too felt stiff where the characters looked so unlike. But whenever Studio Pierrot animated an episode themselves, it was always fabulous!
— Background music was great throughout. Nothing extraordinary, nowhere near bad. The perfect balance you can ask for. Although, a bit old school understandably. But honestly speaking, it gets kind of repetitive & boring at times as the series progresses.
— Opening & ending themes mostly were boring to me. Fighting Dreamers, however, was an iconic banger undoubtedly! Three or four OP & ED were also good enough.
— I watched the full series in English dub & I must say, it was fantastic! From cast to the voice acting, everything was top-notch. The only English voice I wasn't fond of was of Orochimaru. Overall, 9.5/10 for the dub!
— Movies were so very unlike the series. All of them were bad or just ""barely watchable."" However, most of the OVA's were great! Especially the Sports Day one!
— But despite having not read the manga, I can confidently say the direction was mostly spot-on for the canon arcs but the fillers spread basically ruined its potential of greatness. 89 episodes of nothing significant was a pure waste of the potential though, primarily because of the storyboarding & spread. The pacing also could've much better had they addressed the issues I mentioned earlier. 
— Would've a 10/10 without the flaws I mentioned. Still a solid 9/10 for the canon contents, 6/10 for the filler arcs & ovverall a good 7/10 for the entire series. But in the end, the series was still enjoyable, if not ""very,"" regardless & that's what matters the most I believe!
— The first & last episodes of the series were really memorable! That said, I am onto the Naruto Shippuden now! I don't exactly have huge hopes for the series, but I do expect some obvious improvements after everything Naruto Part 1 has done to set it up perfectly. Consistent enjoyment is what I'll be asking for primarily, nothing else really.",7
"
                I don't take into account filler episodes (let's pretend they don't exist and move on with our lives).
TLDR: 
don't forget what you enjoyed as a kid, this was a good show.
INTRO.
With a show like this, people really like to pick it apart while dismissing some important factors. 
First and foremost, I would like to point out that this show was directed towards a young audience, so if you're watching this show as an adult or young adult, it most likely won't have it's desired effect, one needs to review this series with that in mind.
To put it basically, the entire series is centred around a
                  weak young boy who wants to rid himself of his weaknesses and be the strongest version of himself possible. This isn't a new concept for sure, I know it's the core of most Shonen's, however the way in which Naruto handles that concept is so kick-ass that it's almost impossible for most young audiences not to love it.
MY PERSPECTIVE.
I watched the first seasons of Naruto when I was 11 years old, I would like to say it has one of the strongest opening episodes of any series I've ever watched. What I will always remember is the kick-ass opening and ending themes, and the scene in the first episode where Naruto destroys some bad guy in the most overkill way possible that it was just so cool to watch.
You might say the scenes are dragged out and the animation is inconsistent, but I never even remember any of that as a kid since I would be so encapsulated by the characters and waiting to see Naruto inevitably destroy one of them in his next fight.
Seeing Naruto fight though his struggles is something you could say they overplay on, but again, when you're a kid things like sob stories and motivational stories go a long way and have a lot of repeat value. I would say they did it well, very well, and I was so drawn into Naruto's character every fight scene.
You have to consider, if it had this effect on me, it would likely have had a very similar effect on a lot of people, especially if they watched it at the same age as I did. I can imagine if I watched the show for the first time now, I'd probably be thinking ""what the hell is all the fuss about"", just as so many other people have expressed on this website and so many other websites.
RATING.
For a show like this and for myself, it is hard to place an overall number out of 10. There are some scenes that I would rate 10/10 in terms of my own personal satisfaction, if I were to take a harsh critical judgement of the art, story and general production value (things I didnt care about when I was younger), sure, I wouldn't give it anything more than 6/10, overall I would personally give it 8/10.
If you're any older than 14, I would recommend the manga.",8
"
                In my opinion this was a great time when i was a young, i was a huge fan of Naruto i watched everyday after school it was a awesome feeling! But i think the last 3 months i rewatch the show and here are my thoughts 
The First Arc: this arc was a amazing starting of with the first villian duo the demon brothers this was a epic scene we saw Sasuke shine i like that part, 15 minutes later the villian of this arc Zabuza in my opinion best OG villian in Anime history this arc was literally epic for a og show And
                  then we are introduced to a new village and a new villian this arc was Epic!!
The Second Arc: This arc is the best in the whole serie we saw literally ever team shine like this arc was nothing more then perfection if you ask me. The fights were maybe the best fights i ever seen in this whole show and the story is real good it fits perfectly in this arc. And then there is a another thing where we need to talk about the charachters in this arc they were cold too cold if you ask me 
lol i`m not good in giving reviews but this is sure a good anime to watch too appreciate how good this is!",8

                Let’s take a trip back to the mid to late 2000’s. Young Stan wasn’t big in terms of anime compared to now. True he knew what it was, but he didn’t fully grabbed the right mindset of what anime is as a whole. So consider him amazed at how much he loved Naruto back when it premiered in America in 2005. In fact he knew about Naruto back when he played one of the games on the GameCube years ago. And to that day he was super obsessed with the anime.
I bring this up because I’ve been put off of Naruto for years. In fact
                  I think I stopped caring about Naruto up when Shippuden came out. But yet my mind has been wanting me to re-watch it again after all these years. It’s something that’s been taunting me for a while now so I guess you could say it was curiosity. And you know what they say about curiosity. So how is 23 year old Stan with Naruto compared to 11 year old Stan? Well let’s get started.
Story: As the title of the anime suggests, the story is centered around a hot headed young ninja named Naruto Uzumaki who is widely known for being despised by everyone around the world because of being sealed with the Nine Tail Fox inside of him after the Fox was sealed away by the Fourth Hokage. This gets dropped shortly after though as now all of a sudden people start to get used to him, even if they call him out on his stunts. The series does tend to have its own arcs. It starts with Naruto becoming a ninja, to him joining his teammates and master on a mission to escort a bridge builder while taking out rogue ninjas, to taking the Chunin exam (that also sort of went nowhere later down the road), to the invasion of the Leaf Village, to finding the fifth hokage, and finally getting his old teammate back. The anime does have its own arc too, but they’re practically filler. It’s something many people have been pointing out, and if you’ve read the mangas, then you might understand why. In fact they were just created so the manga can continue with its own story. Regardless, the story at it’s best isn’t that good. Even if you do take out the filler aspect, the anime just tends to loses its momentum as the show goes on. As I brought up before, the Chunin exam arc. The anime just hypes it up as it focuses and wonders whether or not the Genins will progress to be Chunin level. But it gets tossed aside for a completely different story arc out of nowhere with the main villain attacking the Leaf Village. It feels so out of place and it has the anime run itself off the tracks in terms of story. There are some positives to the story though. It does do a good job at explaining the backstory of the characters so it does that correctly, but it only goes so far when your main story just ends up being a jumbled mess in terms of plot points.
4/10
Characters: The characters are also regarded to be the major drawback for the anime. Especially the main character. The first thing we see with Naruto is him vandalizing the four hokage’s statue faces. Why? Because he wants to prove to everyone that he is better than how people are treating him. He tends to be really unlikeable at the beginning. As the show goes on, he sort of gets better but not by much. While he tends to be more caring with his friends, he still comes off as a jerk and his personality just comes off as typical for him. As for everyone else, there is no room for character development. You’d figured with 220 episodes under the belt that there COULD be some room, but I guess not. I’d be here all day if I explained it, but the only character that gets some room for development is Naruto, and even then it’s very little. It’s a shame really because some of the characters had that potential. Characters like Sakura, Sasuke, and many more had it but they never did anything with it, making it a let down. The other character I can think of that did sort of get some development is Shikamaru when he becomes a Chunin, but that’s really about it. Even with the characters backstories, it’s really hard to consider them passable.
4/10
Art: Though the art does tend to get a bit rough around the earlier episodes, the animation and art improves greatly as the show goes on. And even for the standards of the time, it definitely holds up well, though some shots can be kind of funny. Shoutout to the scene where they zoom out of Rock Lee in the hospital with Lady Tsunade and Might Guy talking. But back to what I was saying, the fight scenes are also good too. They’re fluid and nice to look at. Especially with the environments around it. 
7/10
Sound: The music is good too. It definitely fits with the show with its Japanese ninja culture. And the OP’s are a rocker to listen to. The dub is fine, except for the title character. No disrespect to the actress who is playing as Naruto, but I couldn’t pick the right voice for him because holy hell his voice totally does not obnoxious in the slightest. Sorry, I forgot to turn off sarcasm mode. And the sound effects is fine too. Really nothing interesting to talk about.
6/10
Enjoyment and Verdict: I wasn’t fully enjoying my time watching Naruto again. I thought my opinions on the anime would remain the same, but sadly that isn’t the case. It isn’t bad. Far from it. But I also wondered why I decided to watch this over other animes at the time. True, the audio and animation are passable, but not enough to save itself from a mediocre story and poor character development, if there is any. I wouldn’t recommend this anime to everyone out there, but I guess if you don’t have anything else to watch then go ahead. But I would not go crazy about it.

                Ahh... Naruto. The anime that got me into anime. Picture this. You are me. You are 14 years old. You are in your physics class. You are tasked to write down a set of questions related to motion, then have a random classmate answer your questions, while you answer their questions. Ok so, you get a girl's questions to answer. You read one of her questions. The first question starts off with ""Naruto runs 10km..."" and you think to yourself...
""Wait a minute, Naruto? As in the orange dude from the anime? That Naruto? Hold on... girls like anime?!?!!""
Yes indeed! It was at that exact moment
                  that I realised girls watch anime. In that moment I thought to myself, what if I watch Naruto and try to impress this girl with my Naruto knowledge. Maybe I could gain a new friend. I know, I know. Typical cringe 14 year old logic.
Later that day, I went home watched and Naruto. Man... to describe me as addicted would be a HUGE understatement! I was completely hooked! That day I officially became a weeb! Why didn't I watch this sooner I thought. Since it was a weekend I had so much time to get up to speed with the basic Naruto lore. Then here comes Monday... it was finally time. Time for me to impress a girl with my Naruto knowledge. 🤡
I get to class and sit in my usual seat and wait for the perfect opportunity to ambush her with my surprise Naruto lore. What could POSSIBLY go wrong?
...
I'll tell you what could go wrong. Exactly what happened to me that day is what could go wrong!
Let me explain. We got a physics question that was about projectile motion. Projectile motion just means motion for a thrown object that is moving through midair. Anyway, I see this as the perfect opportunity that I was looking for. The girl then asks me (btw quick flex, but she sits next to me 😎) she asks me something about one of the questions where you need to calculate the speed of a fast moving projectile and that's when I strike her with my Naruto KNOWLEDGE!
This was it. This was my moment.
I say, ""dang that's a fast moving projectile, if only I had the sharingan then I would be able to see it moving"" and I smirk waiting for a response...
She asks, ""the what?""
I reply with, ""you know, the sharingan... from Naruto""
That's when she tells me that she doesn't even watch Naruto and only needed a random name for the questions she wrote the other day and Naruto was the first name that popped into her head.
Ayo. What?
So yeah. That's basically the cringe tale of how I became a weeb. I did it all for a girl, who didn't even like anime. At least the anime was good.
Who needs a girl when you're on that anime alpha, sigma, ligma, omega grindset? Right guys... right?",9
"
                If you dropped the series at the episode I did you'll still think of Naruto as a good anime. To be fair I have actually watched further than this but I feel episode 80 is just a good stopping point the show just seems to go downhill from there. I have heard that Shippuden starts off really good too but it suffers from the same problem. Too put it simply why exactly the show drops in quality it's simply the writing, Characters feel like they have less depth as time goes on the show seems to lose all of it's initial meaning that even if
                  your not born special if you work hard you can still be great (Rock lee was the best example of this and he was a side character) and their is just WAY too many filler episodes.",7
"
                Let´s set it all clear: between all the anime series with a considerable lenght (total number of chapters), Naruto is one of the most important. Besides, because of being so long, is not the typical serie I can recommend to everyone that wants to get introduced to the Anime world. ¿Do I recommend it to someone who is already into Anime, or someone that has the time and effort to watch it enterily? Sure, at 100%
Story:
For me, its lenght is good and it is an interesting one. Besides all the filler chapters, I don´t think the story evolves too slowly. Maybe it doesn´t have a
                  deep story, but I don´t see this as an inconvenient.
Art:
Pretty good for the years that it was made. Every character has its own habilities and special characteristics, their own techniques... making a great variaty. It can be enjoyable if you´re into the Shinobi world and combats. If not, maybe Naruto is not going to be your Anime.
Sound:
Amazing. I can remember that the music used in sad and melancholic scenes (like ""Sadness and Sorrow"") or combats are very good. It also has a wide variaty of Openings and Endings, some of them very famous and known by a lot of people in the entire world. I think it´s almost impossible that you´re not going to like at least one of the songs Naruto has.
Character:
There are a lot of characters. Almost all of them have a past and an evolution, that can be very deep or not. Something that I really like is that, although we can identify some characters as ""principal/main"", there are a lot of ""secondary"" characters that have an interesting story and will affect to our main characters in the decisions they make, or the fate they will suffer.
Enjoyment:
It´s pretty enjoyable, let´s not lie to ourselves. It´s pretty nice to see Naruto and Sasuke personal evolution and their slow improvement, reaching incredible power and taking completely different life paths.
Overall:
Naruto and its secuel, Shippuden, I have to give them an overall score of 8. It wouldn´t be so strange to give them a 9, simply because all the importance Naruto has inside the Anime world. Although I need to say that there are a lot (and I mean, A LOT) of non-canon (filler) chapters. So if you just wanna enjoy the main story like the manga, you will need to search on the Internet to see which chapters you can skip. If I´m not wrong, about the 50% of all chapters are considered fillers, so it can really be a pain in the ass.",8
"
                Naruto is one of the best known and loved anime to date. I have no shame in saying that I loved this show. I also have no shame in slamming those he feel the need to hate of Naruto because it boasts a more mainstream fanbase. Now Naruto is by no means a masterpiece, it's story is plagued by unnecessary filler which takes away from the experience, some of the characters leave a lot to be desired and its length creates a challenge for those who wish to get into the show. Despite all these factors Naruto does something that makes it of the highest
                  importance to the anime community. Naruto acts as a gateway into the world of anime. Along with this the music brings about a true level of excitement, its fights are a spectacle and still hold up to this day. I have fond memories of the many scenes from Naruto and indeed staring a variety of characters. Sure Naruto is not the greatest show you will ever watch and it will never compete to be however it is something far greater. It is the gateway to the community that we love so dearly and plays a key part in further evolving and inviting others into our community. It should therefore be valued and respected as such.",8
"
                I've always been of the opinion that each anime should be judged for what it is intended to be, and that there is no single set of universal criteria that applies to every work. This is precisely the case for Naruto, because if you are looking for epic storylines, beautiful animation, postmodern philosophy, or something that would change the way you think about the world forever, you won't find it here.  But as Shōnen anime go, Naruto is exemplary because it excels in delivering the kind of positive messages that will benefit younger viewers.  It does a great job of engaging that particular
                  age group with Ninjutsu, fight scenes, etc. which are all mere tools that serve a very clear purpose: to teach morals through the lens of anime.
Character discussion:
Naruto's greatest strength is the character of its eponymic protagonist.  Naruto Uzamaki is a comically flawed yet personable protagonist whose attitude becomes one of the central lessons of the story.  His naïveté, knuckle-headedness and endless positivity despite the loneliness and tragedy of his upbringing is incredibly endearing and inspiriting.  Failure and the rejection of his peers have not turned him into a sociopath (like Gaara), but became fuel for productive goals, albeit simple ones, like … ‘become strong so others will recognise and accept me’.  His quest for acceptance is one which unquestionably garners sympathy.  But it’s his persistence in the face of constant failure, and ability to hold on to his effervescent personality that ultimately serves an inspiration both to viewers as well as the other characters he encounters.
Here I will discuss Rock Lee and Sasuke, both of whom serve as important foils for Naruto.  Effort is everything! Unlike Naruto, Rock Lee is truly mediocre and without talent, but relies on a fanatical, almost laughable attitude of persistence and dedication (‘I slept while on a marathon on this road for three days straight … the track meet of my youth with Guy sensei.  My body still remembers it’).  Much like his Guy sensei (‘five hundred times, yay !'), Lee is intense and brims with a kind of bravado that is different than Naruto's.  While Naruto cares for what others think of him, Rock Lee’s own sense of fulfilment, while staying true to his word, is enough (’no one is watching, Guy sensei’).  It might be narratively fitting that despite making the best of his situation, Rock Lee must still experience failure and stay within the state of constant disappointment and improvement, which of course, cannot faze him in the slightest (‘What’s the matter, Guy sensei ? The prime of youth waits for no-one !’).  Despite not being capable of any Ninjutsu or Genjutsu and having to rely solely on Taijutsu (purely physical martial arts), Rock Lee's total dedication and refusal to give up makes him a great role model.  In comparison, Sasuke is skillful and born with rare, powerful talents thanks to his Uchiha bloodline.  From the moment he enters the Ninja academy with other children, Sasuke is surrounded by attention, praise, and admiration as his peers recognise his prowess, the opposite of the kind of obstacles faced by Naruto.  However, Sasuke is fuelled by revenge against those who caused him unimaginable suffering as a child.  Despite being admired and cared for by his comrades, he refuses to let go of his egocentric obsession.  Viewers get to compare the kind of choices Naruto and Sasuke each make in the face of tragedy and see where their paths lead them.
Other themes:
1) Continuation and the passage of time
The show incorporates numerous flashbacks of different characters at various points of their lives (often as children) provide a sense of verity and continuance to the story.  They show personal growth and remind the viewer that a person’s identity is not simply the snap shot in time that we see in the present.
2) Legacy and Erikson’s concept of ‘generativity’ 
There is the idea of legacy and symbolic immortality in the sense that even after death, one can live on in the form the continuation of one’s ideals in others.  Even simple nurturing can become a form of strength in moments when it is most needed.  Similarly, following in the footsteps of those before and looking towards their example becomes a way for young Shinobi and Kunoichi to draw from their inner courage.
Criticism:
Naruto has been widely criticised for the number of filler episodes which are enjoyable but nonetheless substantially hindered by the lack of character development, stakes, or plot progression.  Make no mistake, there were some highly entertaining, primarily comic detours, but as a whole, the show came to a standstill at some point after episode 134 and failed to engage viewers on a consistent basis.  It seemed to follow a predictable pattern of ‘Naruto doing odd jobs, then being given a low level assignment by Tsunade who throws him with some random combination of two other Chūnin since no one else is available (allegedly), and the trio discovering that the mission is more treacherous than anticipated’.  The fifth and final season of Naruto noticeably improved midway through (episode 200-) with a deliberate shift back to multi-episode arcs, each with its unique flavours, tensions, and payoffs.  The Yakumo / Kurenai Genjutsu arc in particular offered an nice showcase of surrealist and psychological concepts.
Viewers would also be correct to criticise a number of characters such as Hinata who have remained one-dimensional, though there is hope that they will become more interesting in the next instalment.
Overall, Naruto can be a great anime for adolescents.  Its popularity speaks for its broad appeal and ability to strike an emotional chord with the vast majority of viewers.  Of course it is not without its faults, but just as one wouldn't deride Narnia or Dr. Seuss for not being up to standard for the Nobel Prize in Literature, it isn't reasonable to expect Naruto to be more than it was meant to be.",7
"
                Naruto, to this day, remains one of my favorite anime is the anime that really started my love for the Japanese culture as a whole. It is sentimentally the number one anime in my own view. I wouldn't mind watching any one of the episodes in my free time if the chance came. It is a wonderful show with characters that truly touch your heart and know how to put a permanent place in your life. My only complaint is the excessive amount of fillers that are throughout this anime, mainly after Sasuke's depart from the spotlight. The amount of episodes afterward was definitely unnecessary
                  although gave decent leeway for the minor characters.",10
"
                Naruto was an appealing show to me as a kid. It was great to watch when I was 8 or so. Watching the whole show again felt so much slower in pace that what I experienced as a child. It was mediocre at best. I feel that the useless filler was what ruined it. Maybe it's that I watched too much shorter anime these days or that it was actually boring. I give it 6 because although it was so slow with storyline and useless filler, it was enjoying to experience the fight scenes. I seriously disliked the plot as it was just...boring. It could
                  have been executed well if not for the ""major"" arcs being so damn long. It took about 10-20 episodes just to finish the first part. I guess some of the characters were enjoyable with their diverse and vibrant personalities, besides the most idiotic cliches in the main characters.",6
"
                I dont think this series deserves to be so overappreciated. 
But I also don't hink it's bad in any kind of way.
I mean this series is like what i expected from it. It's made for kids who watch TV and not for an older target group. So that's basically why it's story is not that complex, animations aren't the best and, and there is no real big Plot.
But even though I give it a 7 (good) because it's just fun to watch, like how a kid's show should be.
And to all the people who give it a bad rating because it's not that good:
watch ""Comet
                  Lucifer"" this is like a really good erample for a show that doesnt have a complex story or good plot but also isn't fun to watch",7

                Naruto - one of the most famous series, for many one of the first anime in their lives that encouraged them to reach for other series, thanks to which our otaku world got two things: a lot of merchandise to sell and that cursed style of running through which you hope at some point that the alien hiding in Area 51 will break free and bring doom to the human species.
But what made a demonic fox eating a bowl of Japanese broth (I feel I just provoked somewhere around half the Japanese population with that term) so successful? Well, when asked myself (the list of
                  friends who could ask me is so narrow that even fingers using the One Thousand Years of Death technique wouldn't fit) if I wanted to watch as many as 130 episodes of the first series (hey, I also have my own life, much of which I wouldn't want to spend watching fillers) I could only say one thing: COME ON!
The plot takes place in a ninja world familiar to almost everyone who enters the world of anime, in which the main character, Naruto Uzumaki has a dream: to become the Hokage - the leader of the Village of the Hidden Leaf. This is not easy, as he carries within him a sealed fox demon, which at one time almost turned this village into a landscape reminiscent of that of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 (this time I certainly pissed off the entire population of Japan). Luckily, he has loyal friends (who are a bit like invisible ink - they pop up here and there when things get heated, only to forget a significant number of them in the next series), including Sasuke ""I'll have the most volatile of goals guided by a rather twisted logic in the next series"" Uchiha, and Sakura ""People will remember me for being useless, but the same thing are somehow able to forgive Hinata"" Haruno, and all three get under the care of Kakashi ""I know 1000 methods for heart surgery"" Hatake. Together they'll fight ninjas, defend the village, and use all sorts of techniques while probably having some of the most flexible fingers I've seen in anime so far (and yes, I tried to do that too, but who hasn't?).
The story itself contains a ton of interesting, diverse characters, especially the antagonists, who are memorable for a long time, and a ton of great fights where it's all about who's smarter instead of physical strength (before it turned into fights full of explosions, because as we know ninjas wanted to be as loud as a certain Saudi millionaire in 2001). But despite the sarcasm I'm venting here I had a great time! The music is brilliant, making the adventures of the young ninja more and more engrossing, the artwork and animation (apart from those single freeze-frames the internet was flooded with) still hold up very well. It's also worth appreciating the fact that you can feel the difference in the strength of the characters, which makes watching a fight between two novices a completely different experience from watching a fight at the Hokage level.
The only drawbacks I can mention here are the increasingly frequent flashbacks in the later part of the series (especially in this ONE arc) and the annoyance that the main character sometimes caused with his character. And if you want to watch absolutely all the episodes then you need to be prepared for a ton of fillers.
To sum up: the first Naruto series is a very good anime, maybe not without its flaws, but it clearly shows why so many people in the world fell in love with a certain easy to spot (like a real ninja, not those nerds dressed in black) orange kid with a dream.",8
"
                Story - Naruto first off is primarily an action anime which has a very strong base story which really draws you in while also managing to have a variety of interesting side story plots as well. There is so much amazing story content and possibilities that there was really no need for the amount of filler that they incorporated into the story for no reason. The filler is what will makes this anime hard to get through since this section of the story, being 220 episodes long consists of roughly 1/3 of filler. Even with that said I can say with great confidence that it's
                  worth it to get through, you can even skip the filler entirely as well. This arc has a lot of epic moments and reveals many very intense story details to follow in a later arc which is why getting through this is definitely worth your time. 
Characters - The main character being Naruto will make you feel a variety of feelings through his growth...some positive and some negative but there is plenty of growth. Not only with Naruto alone but this anime manages to introduce a large variety of characters that makes it hard to choose a favorite at times each being entirely unique with their own personal development. Some characters show more growth then others but overall there is a large variety of different character growth personally and physically. The one area that is lacking for characters is the female characters and development or the writing devices used to try and include a romantic aspect which falls short of being effective. This arc does a great job at setting up the story and characters for later arks to follow.
Quality - The animations are well done with no complaints, only a few instances where you can see some short cuts were taken but overall very clean and well done. The animations for the fight scenes are also well done in combination with their powers they possess (jutsu) having so many unique options and ways to show them were very impressive in how they were displayed. Also has a pretty great soundtrack. 
Overall - There is a reason this anime is so mainstream and popular and that is because it is amazing! Sure it has it's flaws but the positives more then make up for it and in later arcs as well even more. If you are the type that loves an immerse story and character development and action you need to watch this one.",8

                QUICK NON SPOILER REVIEW - FILLER ARC NOT INCLUDED (Because it's terrible, with the exception of kakashi mask off,  laughing shino and guy/Lee episodes)
Story: let's get right to it, it's ninjas fighting with this idea of chakra protecting themselves from other nations and orochimaru. Honestly, story is a solid 8/10. There's nothing wrong with it, and it definitely follows the typical shounen type , except people actually die, which I loved. The arcs are long and interesting , captivating your attention with multiple fights. My only gripe would be that some fights can take 5+ episodes.. and they're not even the main character fights
                  ( refer to 4 guards). Also  wayyyyy too many flashbacks. Like too many. Get ready to use that +10 seconds  button because you're going to need it.
 With no spoilers, the story revolves around sasuke and naruto, and their love hate relationship with some sakura screaming in between with constant attacks coming from orochimaru. That's pretty much it.
Also as a side note.. I get the concept of chakra, but Its a bit silly how they can do anything with it, and turn into demons lmao.
Art: 6/10 ehh.. it's outdated, isn't the best. 
Sound: oh boy.. 11/10. It's phenomenal.  The orochimaru theme tune is superb, it sells chills down you. I genuinely think the sound Is what makes naruto so f******** good. The right notes are used at the right moments, the flute is so perfect for this Japanese medieval setting.
Character: 6/10 .. sakura.. enough said. She's useless throughout the entire show. I do admit however that the side characters 100% get some development,  but it's more like... get stronger, nothing changes about them really, with perhaps the exception of shikamaru who was by far my favourite character alongside Lee. 
The villains however, they're so full of detail and mystery.  I especially enjoyed haku and zabuzas story, and how they linked up later to the kaguya clan. Also orochimaru is honestly, an amazing villain. He's up there with the likes of dio .
Enjoyment: if you skip the fillers, it's a solid 8/10 .
Pros:
Amazing fudgeing soundtrack
There's actually deaths in the shounen!
Orochimaru
Rock lee
Villains are super interesting
Naruto is pretty cool.
Cons:
Sakura
Too many flashbacks 
Fillers.. lots of them..
It is a shounen.. but damn these guys can take a 2000stabs and be okay.
So yeah. Give it a watch!

                Naruto a show about a year older than me now I've watch a lot of anime in the sort 16 years I've been on earth this may be one of the most well thought out animes I will every watch it may not have the best animation but its story telling its character development its soundscaping may be the best in media as a whole for a show I've only watch 80 eps of its impressive the characters feel like real people which is rare to see Naruto as the main character is maybe one of the best he at the start is a brat
                  that cause trouble non but by the time he sees his first death he changes like a real person would every ep that goes by we see him change and learn from what he has seen he grows as a person and that's only him I could write books about close to every character but its the villains that may stand out the most by far the best villains I have seen in media they are all very complex in there own write  not just having one motivation one goal they have more then that they are all a complex web of goals and aspirations and that could also be applied for close to any character but that is only one issue with the story the pacing at times the slowness can be good it helps understand the characters but there are a lot of scenes that are repeated or dragged on for far to long like its better just to skip the first 3 mins of every eps because its just going to the last 1 or 2 mins of the last eps but if you have the time its well worth it. the art well its an old show its not bad but hasn't age like a wine as such not much to say not the best not the worse it works. but the sound how to even describe it its basically perfect sound is used at the right time and not to much a lot of anime are to loud or to quiet but naruto hits that Balance dead on its used in a perfect way to help the view understand the characters and what is going on. overall if you come to naruto for the fights your gonna have to wait till naruto shippuden but still the fights arnt to bad but if that the only thing you like nartuo isnt going to be your thing.",10
"
                honestly, I'm just watching ever non filler episode and this is a great anime, I did grow up watching it here and there but 10 years later I finally decided to sit down and watch it and all I gotta say is it's worth it don't let the bad quality fillers take away from this classic anime. The story, the characters development are amazing on there own but the artwork and fight scenes are just amazing I love every minute of it although some fights are drawn out and some take 2-3 episodes to finish. the music especially when an inspirational speech or a fight
                  is about to happen and that recorder sounding instrument plays (idk what it actually is) is just awesome.",9
"
                Originally, I didn't want to make a review on Naruto but here I am. I've seen a few episodes of Naruto on TV before but I haven't fully watched the whole Naruto series. For the most part, I was impressed with the storyline and was hooked, however, it did take me a few episodes to actually get into it. You either love the characters, or you don't (I loved most of the characters, don't get me wrong) and I thought the storyline was perfectly executed. The background music was well put and was placed at the appropriate scenes. Overall, this anime is worth the shot
                  if you love thrilling action anime.",7
"
                I will keep this short.
Manga is 9/10
Games 10/10
Anime is 4/10
When anime adapts manga it's really good, but when it switches to fillers it becomes boring and it has of total 41% of filler percentage. The main reason why I dislike the fillers is because they never ad nothing meaningful to the overall story.
I recommend reading manga over anime, because the story is really good with some interesting character development, and protagonist route to achieve his dreams.
If you like the manga and experience other source the anime when your best choice are the Naruto Storm series. The games really did a fantastic job at balancing game
                  mechanics with story showcase.",4

                Holy freaking crap.  This show man.  I've watched this whole thing through probably 4 times, and boy can I say I love it to death.  Too bad it's also one of the most appalling pieces of literature I've ever had the pleasure of sitting through. 
If you hate this show, grow up, if you love this show, grow up, but maybe, just maybe.  After sitting through it enough times to say you're familiar with every little detail, reference, and piece of foreshadowing, and having gained all there is to gain from such as show, all I can say (as someone who
                  has lived through this very situation myself) is that you have WASTED your time.",3

                Naruto is an over-Savage work, it is good, yes, but it is not so bad, for many a copy of hunter x hunter, in my opinion Naruto is superior to Hunter X hunter (anime), but outside that, Naruto is an anime that begins Well with solid bases, but you notice many incessant things, like the kiss of Naruto and Sasuke and among more, the first saga, that of Sabuza, is the best of all, it starts weak but it goes up to more, I think it is the only one Once the embolism makes sense in the saga, it is a great opening to the
                  rest, the chunin exams is a good saga, much better than that of Hunter x Hunter or other anime, it is an arc that presents more characters and the ambition of others How could Ino or Sakura be, the bad thing is the filling between the arc, it is unnecessary and boring, the end of the arc is good, with the death of the 3 hokage, from here naruto declines a lot, with a lot of filling up to the arc of sasuke's release, it is a great arc but it lacks sense, because the mandari hokage to 6 children on a suicide mission ?, the arc ends in a good way with Sasuke winning, after here the anime is completely aurrina with pure filler, if the main character has a stupid goal, being ""Hokage"", that It is like the president, in his own words, wants to do it so that people respect him, this does not make sense because in the continuation Narito is already respected for having defeated Pain, As in Hunter x hunter, a meaningless ambition.",7

                Naruto is an anime that has influenced so many genres of art and people, it has a long and complex but fun story to go along with it and this is the first part of naruto.
This is the part that covers Naruto's childhood and his life without giving out some little important mysteries until the 13th year of his life. First of all, if you don't like shounens, yeah this has a rather simple plot if we exclude action and emotions, it is quite simple and stuff like ""oh bad guy is there, I will become strongrrr, oh no friend go bye bye why did
                  friend go bye bye :'(? I will go after him and save him"", so, it is the story of Naruto, a young kid who is has the Nine-tailed fox, Kurama sealed in him, the story of his parents are unknown to us right now but we do know they are both dead or missing. Naruto has almost no real friends and everybody dislikes him for having the beast that once destroyed the shinobi village in him. In this world of ninjas we have several shinobi/ninja villages with names that are mostly about elements like water and fire but also objects like rocks or leaves. The one naruto resides in is called the leaf village and the kage there is called Hokage. The hokage currently is Hiruzen. Naruto is a little prankster and instead of studying he does some pranks that worsen his popularity even further. His life soon changes when he passes his class for the first time and gets in team 7. Overseen by Kakashi and his other two members are sakura Hano and Sasuke Uchiha. They become better friends than before making this team and the story slowly advances.
So, I will not spoil the rest of the story but it mostly is a single antagonist and issue alongside them just doing some business and meeting new guys like Gaara or taking some exam. It is good, this is the anime version, after reading the manga I must say they did not put as many catchphrases and flashbacks as the anime did, it simply was full of them. This improved the nostalgia but some people just hated that and the biug amount of fillers, it had 2 whole seasons of fillers, I have watched them and well, they don't continue the story but they're fun. 9/10, fun but not for everybody.
The art is alright for 2002-2007, looks good and the first episodes are so nostalgic. 8/10 alright.
It has quite some songs, if i had to choose a couple I would say Speed as the best ending and haruka kanata, go!!! no boy, no cry as the best openings. Quite some good ones but some are quite poor. 8/10
The characters are just legendary with so many good characters that everybody knows. Many popular characters, lots of personalities, not that much depth unless you are an mc, ya know. 8/10
Overall, naruto was fine, it had some fillers I enjoyed but many people didn't overall, it has lots of shounen elements and it is one as a whole so if you don't enjoy them don't watch it and drop it after 3 episodes or something. 8.5/10 since the nostalgia can't exactly cover for every flaw this anime had. Would say it is definetely worth watching if you would enjoy it.",8
"
                Ah, Naruto. One of the classical shounens that have defined what anime is today. At first, I was reluctant to watch the show because of the overwhelming episode count mixed in with it's other seasons but now that I have finished it I could safely say I have no regrets. First impressions were fairly decent and the story looked interesting from the start. Of course we've seen this if we watched other shounens from this day and age but remember, this is where all of it started or at least most of it.
Okay, starting with the review for the show, I will say this first
                  when I saw that Naruto isn't as great as the public portrays it to be. Sure, it is pretty good and will leave an impact on you as you watch it, giving some moral advices and some undeniably beautiful action but it does have it flaws, the not-so noticeable ones and the pretty bad ones. I'm not going to nitpick because though some of the flaws are bad, they're still not the most obvious ones but yeah, a flaw is still a flaw. Then we have the fillers, of course this could be bad, okay or good depending on who you are but personally, I think they weren't that bad. Sure it doesn't contribute much to the story but for people like me that enjoys what there is to enjoy, the filler is definitely enjoyable, though not most are like this and thus makes it one of the show's worst selling point. 
The story was pretty good in my opinion, the whole show until ep 135 focused around the main story about the rise of Naruto and him building up his reputation and skill to make himself worthy of the title he so dreamt of as 'hokage'. Naruto seems to be set in a world where 'modern' and the age of 'ninjas' took place and mixing those two together you get a very diverse world with endless possibilities to tell and that's pretty unique. Again, if you came here relatively new and has watched other shounens like Boku no Hero Academia or Black Clover, the concept is practically the same though the only difference is that Naruto is the grandfather of the concept as far as I can see. After episode 135 the anime seems to have taken a turn to the fillers as they had to give the manga some breathing space from the anime and again, depending on who you are, the fillers are a complete hit or miss.
I'll say this here and now that I'm a believer that old animes that is decades old should not be compared to animes that is relatively new and is a decade older than the anime you're comparing it to. I tend to just see the animation quality of the specific anime era and compare it from there and Naruto specifically didn't do the worst, though there are somewhat better animations out there at that time and the animation could be a little clunky and inconsistent at times but not enough to make it a bad selling point. The sound quality isn't bad at all but actually, it was great. I enjoyed all the opening sand the more memorable one of opening 2 which is 'Haruka Kanata' and honestly, there isn't much to be said about it other than they're all great. Though, the voice acting could feel a little strange for the Japanese dub at times and doesn't feel like they'r 'acting the moment' but overall they're good.
The cast is pretty good for me personally, I liked everyone that has appeared on the show and the number of characters just gives vibrancy and more depth to the show itself. The main ones were the ones that particularly caught most eyes being Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke and the semi-main ones are definitely given a lot, lot more screentime that other characters that isn't exactly the main ones. The character development here is good though not amazing and complex where there is an amazing difference from their ideals and personality from the time they were introduced until the time the show either ended or met their demise. It's more subtle and predictable in a way like the usual changing ideals and turning bad into good guys ones, trying to change their ways, and just getting better in general. Though this is a shounen and that doesn't mean the character development  is bad at all because they got a lot of episodes to improve on every characters and maneuver them into the right direction and they did it pretty decently in my opinion. Though in general, the whole cast of Naruto is likeable, in a good way or not.
Overall, Naruto is what you would call a once in a generation anime series for all it's strengths and flaws. Though, it is not as great as the public would describe it, it's still a pretty good watch in my opinion and you wouldn't regret it at the end. I personally enjoyed Naruto very much and is looking forward to what shippuden has to offer. Though one last reminder is that I see a lot of people criticizing Naruto for it's 'unlogical' elements. Say, what type of show do you think Naruto is, yeah you should know better and if you really hate 'unlogical' then I would give my condolences to you for not being able to watch a lot of animes out there. It's a shounen, you've watched a shounen, and you definitely know it's a shounen, what do you expect.",8
"
                After almost twenty years since Naruto came out for the first time, here I am writing a review about it. Better late than never, I guess.
Anyway, let’s start.
Story: 8/10
The story is nice and very enjoyable. Since I watched this series after many years, a lot of things were not new to me because I saw them in other anime, but it is perfectly normal and I decided not to take it into account while doing this review. After all, twenty years ago Naruto was very innovative and special, right?
One of the things that I did not like much, is the fact that many fights could
                  take about two episodes to end, but they instead last for over ten episodes. It wasn’t necessary at all. 
Art, animation, graphic: 7/10
I decided to give the animation a seven over ten because I didn’t like it much and there were many mistakes, but I also have to consider that I’m used to watching new anime with amazing graphics. For this reason, the score I gave is seven over ten.
Sound: 8/10
I won’t take too long to talk about sound. I just want to say that I loved the main theme and the sad tunes were just amazing. Furthermore, I’ll always remember the “Natsuhiboshi” song from one of the filler arcs. It’s beautiful.
I liked the last few openings too. 
Character: 7/10
I always write a lot about characters when I write reviews because I think they are one of the most important things to judge anime.
- The protagonist, Naruto, is a very energetic and dumb kid. He has to grow a lot and I hope to see a big development in Naruto Shippuden. I like the fact that he is not overpowered and that he is not the strongest among his friends; he still has many things to learn.
- At first, in the series, everything was about Sasuke and he looked like the main character. It was amazing to go throw the episodes and see him become aware that he was not the protagonist of the series LOL. Anyway, I found his back story extremely mysterious and interesting and I’m looking forward to learning more in the next series. 
- Sakura… well, I didn’t like her, sorry. I found her useless and at first, I found it hard to watch Naruto because she was too annoying. After a while, I decided to take note of all the episodes in which she was useful in some way and the result is the following: more or less, four episodes over 220… and the problem here is that she is part of the main trio! Many side characters were more useful than her. I really hope to see her doing something more in Naruto Shippuden. And her personality… argh. The way she treats Naruto is almost unbearable. 
- Other characters were okay, with nice personalities and interesting backstories. Honorable mention for Rock Lee: I loved him. 
Enjoyment: 7/10
Talking about the story of Naruto, I didn’t consider all the filler episodes because I wanted to review only the canon events of the series. Now I have to. 
41% of “Naruto” is composed of fillers and it is definitely too much. Some of them were good and enjoyable, but others were bad and even inconsistent with the original story. I found it difficult and sometimes boring watching them all. If it wasn’t for them, the score would have been 8/10, but in this way, it should probably deserve a six. 
Overall: 7/10",7
"
                I read this weekly as a kid, I was in love. I loved the music, the characters, the cool designs. It's the show that got me into anime years back! But, rewatching it recently and it really isn't that great. There are shows out there that are many times better but the one thing I personally think naruto has over them is the time it came out. It was released at the perferct time for it to blow up, anime had only just arrived in my country and it had everything a kid wants in a show. Because of this it has a special place
                  in so many peoples hearts, making it become the overhyped show it is now.
Thank you for reading my ted talk",5
"
                 my friends review: 
Naruto is a pretty fun ride that starts off with a darker story arc, but after that descends into ridiculousness. The story is intriguing, the characters have potential, and the music is good enough. This is a hot take but I do not like the music in Naruto nearly as much as everyone else does. Sure it's good but it isn't great.
But on to the story. The story is very unique and it has the potential to go to very interesting places. And the characters, some of them at least, support this story to the end. But despite that, there are
                  some characters that are so unnecessary and useless who don't add anything to the show at all.
 my response :
yes,
Naruto is a fun ride and it does start off with a amazing kinda dark story arc but it sets the tone well(espiecally for shippuden) and after that it does not go into ridiculousness just because seasons 7-9 are pretty much all filler the first arc doesn't last that long. I enjoyed the Chunin exams and the Sasuke vs Naruto battle which was not in the first arc. (Unless you felt like that was ridiculous). And that was only to name a few. The story is great and although majority of the side characters they didn't do a good job on I think the tone for what was coming in the future was set well. The music was amazing. I think that majority of the characters actually had something to do with the show except majority of the ones from other villages and filler characters. Much hate to my friend for making this review ( Although I respect their opinion). okey that is all I loved this show and i'm sorry to anyone reading for wasting your time except for my friend. :)",7
"
                Ah Naruto, my childhood anime. I recently wondered if it is able to stand the test of time and underwent the endeavour of watching the entire show (at least the canon episodes). So let's get right into it:
STORY
The basic premise of Naruto is that of a boy, Naruto, who was an outcast in his village but wants to become it's leader and protector and works hard to be accepted and make friends. Quite simple, I know, but it does the trick. This story can be divided into a number of story arcs. The canon ones (adapted from the manga of the same name) tend to
                  be better than the filler. Now, I did find the very first arc (ep. 1-19) to be quite slow and boring. It's writing, while trying to be emotional, ends up being sloppy and obvious. I also couldn't deal with the main fight of this arc which took almost 10 episodes in which barely anything happened. I, however, would not let this discourage you as the story steadily picks up on pace and quality as it progresses.
That is because the coming arcs introduce villains and conflicts which drive the plot forward. It also picks up on some quite dark themes such as the meaning of life, the effects of grief and abuse or the consequences of idealism and ruthless dedication. And it deals with these topics much better than you would probably expect.
The one thing bothering me about the story is the insane amount of filler: 90 episodes, or 2.070 minutes, of filler to be exact. That's insane. What makes this worse is that the quality of the filler arcs is usually way below that of the canon arcs. Sure there are some diamonds in the rust but they don't justify watching 90 episodes to find them, so I'd just recommend skipping all the filler. The fact that around 40% of this show is skippable is obviously a huge downside.
CHARACTERS
Naruto has too many characters to list here, so I'm just gonna focus on the protagonist:
In the first episodes, Naruto seems like an annoying brat. He's the village prankster and few people like him. However, as the show goes on, you find out why Naruto is the way he is and you start like him with all his flaws. He also experiences quite some character growth making friends, becoming stronger and emotionally mature. He has the ability to emotionally connect with others, especially outcasts who experienced loneliness, and shows the good in people. I think that Naruto is a great protagonist, one with which many can relate and one which many will enjoy seeing grow.
As for the other characters, they are all likeable, well-written, have elaborated backstories and clear ideals. And while this show has a solid 220 to achieve that, I think it is still an impressive achievement to make me truly care for over 15 characters.
ANIMATIONS
The animations are possibly the worst part of Naruto. They are lazy, sloppy and often ugly. The show's format is 4:3. Once again, they do get better as the show progresses but they are never good. You can often only see small fractions (such as hands, or expressions) of what's going on. I guess as a way to conserve ressources during the production. Sometimes the same animation will be repeated for a solid minute (such as characters jumping from tree to tree in a chase), characters in the background almost never move and are barely drawn. Some character designs, especially of villains in the filler arcs, are truly horrendous. Just google the ""Legendary Stupid Brothers"" at your own risk. Makes me mad just to look at. You will, however, get used to the quality of animations as you watch.
FIGHTS
The poor animations obviously also negatively affect the fights. Sometimes you don't even know what's going on because the show absolutely refuses to show full body shots. Instead, you'll get close-ups of hands and faces and whatnot. This show is also a major offender of having it's characters talk too much during fights. A ninja will literally flank his opponent from behind but then have an entire super-villain monologue before striking. Often, the events in fights also just don't make sense. Characters will act completly devoid of logic, standing smack in the middle of traps for what feels like ages, or not attacking an opponent standing still while summoning some sort of monster. You can always, and I mean always, expect the person running at his opponent to lose that engagement. The guy standing still will always win, atleast that attack.
Nontheless, I still found the fights of this show to be good. They pack a ton of emotional weight and you truly care about the characters. It also feels incredibly satisfying to see them grow. 
MUSIC
The music in Naruto is great. And I'm not talking about the openings here. The music during the episodes is great at setting up different atmospheres. And as the same tracks and melodies are repeatedly used, you will come to recognize and like them.
SUMMARY
Naruto is a good show. It's story is straight-forward but satisfying. The characters are truly great and well-written. The animations are bad but the fights nontheless manage to be good because of the sheer emotional weight they carry. I do believe that any shonen fan should at least try watching this show, simply because it is such a classic. And while Naruto isn't groudbreaking stuff, it's certainly deserving of it's popularity. This show could be much better without all the filler.",7
"
                This is my first MAL review, so let's see how it goes. I read a few volumes of the Naruto manga as a kid didn't get around to watching the anime series in its entirety until many years later. I know many fans who grew up watching Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden, and while I don't have that nostalgia attached to the series, the original Naruto was nonetheless an enjoyable experience.
Story
Naruto follows the standard recipe of a battle shonen anime. A determined but dim-witted adolescent character with a mythical power (Naruto Uzumaki) must overcome ever-greater obstacles and enemies in order to accomplish his goal - in
                  his case becoming Hokage. Although the story was formulaic at times, I still found it to be both compelling and engaging. I found myself invested in Naruto's personal journey and the struggles he faces along the way, and was intrigued by various plot points as I learned about the characters and world. I thought the world-building was executed well for the most part; the series did a good job at explaining things like chakra, jutsu, shinobi villages and countries that all exist in its world. 
Art/Animation
Naruto's animation comes off as lackluster and dated, though the art style based on Masashi Kishimot's manga looks good. There are several episodes or shots that stood out from an animation and art style perspective. A number of fight scenes look great both in terms of art style and animation quality, such as Rock Lee vs. Gaara during the Chunin Exam and Naruto vs. Sasuke during the retrieval arc. The character designs, technique designs and background shots of settings like Konohakagure are pretty good.
Sound
Naruto's sound design and OST are arguably some of the series' strongest points. The score composed by Toshio Masuda does a great job at complimenting the various emotions portrayed throughout the series, whether that's tension, sadness, drama or comedy. The combination of rock music and traditional Japanese music is something that stood out to me across a number of musical pieces in the series. Most of the openings and endings were pretty good, too.
Characters
The main cast tin Naruto seems to follow a formulaic depiction typical to battle shonen. In addition to Naruto Uzumaki, who is is a rather conventional shonen MC, you have the silent but deadly deuteragonist (Sasuke Uchiha) with a traumatic past and a rival mentality toward the MC. A female character who develops a niche skill but is otherwise far below the two other main cast members (Sakura Haruno) and the sensei (Kakashi and Jiraiya) fit typical archetypes too. That isn't to say these are bad characters. On the contrary, was invested in and attached to most of the characters in this series. The side characters really stood out to me too. Rock Lee, Gaara, Shikamaru and Neji have good backstories and/or unique abilities, and other side characters like Kiba, Shino, Choji, Hinata and Tenten are good additions to the cast too. 
Enjoyment
Naruto was a very enjoyable series to watch and had a fair amount of thematic depth and emotional impact. Looking forward to starting Naruto: Shippuden!",8

                This review is only about Naruto, not including Naruto Shippuden.
After watching Naruto three times, I finally decided to externalize my experience, as I now feel mature enough to identify flaws. Although I have loved this anime since I was a child, there are 3 key points where it fails a lot, which I will point out in the future, but there are many good things as well.
Story: 6/10
That's the point that has most problems, but not because of the story itself. There is complexity here, not in the sense of making the viewer think a lot, but in the construction of the world, which has
                  many details. Simple and interesting, the main story is well told and the points connect a lot.
Now the first key point where there is error is precisely this excessive connection between points with many, many, many, many flashbacks. 
I can live with that, can you? There are flashbacks after a few minutes of the same scene, repetitions of the same flashbacks in several episodes, even flashbacks in flashbacks (seriously?). You can't tell if this was meant to delay the episodes for the manga to advance further or the pierrot animation studio thinks viewers are extremely dumb, maybe both. The fact is that you can form a considerable amount of episodes with only flashbacks. Skipping the flashbacks is an option to watch faster, but the rhythm of the anime is so good that I end up not caring much about rewatch scenes. Do you realize how many times I said the word ""flashback""? That's exactly what they do. 
Naruto's 2nd flawed point that fits into this category are fillers. Fortunately, the vast majority happens after the end of the main arcs, however it is a large number of episodes (almost the same amount of those considered canonical) that end only when Naruto Shippuden is aired, which reveals a greed on the part of the studio to continue drawing the attention of the audience with totally useless arcs, when it could very well end and wait for the right moment to release episodes that really matter. If only a few of them added to the work, but 99% are disposable. 
Predictability is noticeable at certain times to make some characters achieve a goal, but nothing serious. One aspect that makes this anime gain so much strength is its connection with feelings, especially sadness and loneliness, these end up being expressed in such intense and different ways that they talk to the viewer very easily. It's not about making your brain boil by putting together pieces, but about reaching a human's heart with entertainment.
Art: 6/10
The characters have a unique design that brings a lot of charisma to the anime. The most realistic style combines a lot with the proposal, the environment is also very good, but sometimes simple and erased, since several events take place in the forest. Deformations occur in a good amount of scenes, sometimes fitting well with the impact of the blow that some character suffered, but these are problems in the animation for the most part, which leads to the 3rd point flawed in Naruto: instability in the animation.
Sound: 10/10
There are good and bad openings and endings, the sound of the characters is very good, but the highlight is with the soundtrack, which is a masterpiece. The songs are memorable, the impact of the scenes several times is enhanced thanks to them, especially the sad ones, which can boost your tears even before the facts occur. That's the power of this soundtrack.
Character: 7/10
As the anime focuses heavily on the humanity of the characters, it is very easy to identify with one or many of them. Naruto is the character most likely to annoy, it is compressible that he is a child, but others around are also and do not have this explosive and noisy behavior that he demonstrates sometimes. As a child I didn't find some of his attitudes annoying, so the question must be how mature is who is watching, but he is a good protagonist overall. 
If there is no physical progression, there is psychological, emotional maturation. Most female characters end up gaining less progression, limiting themselves to strengthening their emotions, while the male majority progress in both aspects. The characters less important to the overall story are minimally interesting because of their distinctive abilities, physical appearance, or way of acting. It's interesting to see from the perspective of someone who isn't strong but wants to be, and depends on the attitude of others, even if it can be annoying sometimes.
In the end, most of the main villains don't look like villains, as they are built in a very charismatic and empathetic way. The feeling is that they are lost and someone needs to look behind their eyes, there are very personal motivations behind their attitudes that lead them to confront the protagonists.
Enjoyment: 9/10
I ended up never being touched so much emotionally by another anime, it's like a part of me is in so many characters... If you put all these parts together, there I am. It's fun, fast, exciting and emotional. Far from perfect, all the positive aspects of Naruto are enough for me to enjoy it, perhaps, much more than it deserves. 
As is noticeable by what I said at the beginning, there is a timeless value here that will make you return a few times to review everything. It is an anime recommended mainly for beginners and people who have never watched any, because after watching a considerable amount you may not have patience for the mistakes of this one.",7
"
                It was really a good experience, I enjoyed it a lot. The emotions, the feelings of every character, and what they are trying to Convey are conveyed perfectly.  Naruto is the main focus, his struggles to fulfill his dream which is to b a Hokage are expressed in firm way from the start and he never gives up on his promise, and his friends. He always protects his friends and people who need help, before himself. He prioritizes others over himself. He is an innocent boy, he never gives up and always wins. Due to the nine-tailed fox, he is ill-treated but always puts
                  a smile on and tries his best. The other characters are also well written, the fights are good, and all the episodes except some fillers but all episodes are worth-it.
What I suggest for naruto is you should watch for the emotions. Thoroughly enjoyed it. 
I give it 8/10.",8

                Naruto is my childhood anime. A very fun anime. An anime that made me admire a ninja and want to be a ninja. The core of the story, this anime tells about a ninja boy named Naruto. Naruto is hated by the villagers for having a 9-tailed fox monster inside his body, the Kyubi. But Naruto did not give up, and wanted to realize his dream of becoming the village leader, Hokage. And finally respected by the whole village.
What makes me love this anime is the funny and entertaining story, epic ninja fight scenes, powerful ninja techniques, and amazing character development.

                Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,naruto,probable the most overrated anime of all time,you probable start watch this anime because you heared is very good but a think you probable you dont know is as the most overrated anime and have one of the worst fandoms.The fandom think every anime who apeare after naruto is a copy and the fandom is formed by 12 yo. kids so,be ready to see kids who say animes who apeare before naruto are copys,naruto fans are toxics in more difrit ways like saying naruto can beat ichigo,goku,zeno,luffy and more characters in the same time.If you want to start this anime I will say just one
                  think,skip the fillers,you dont want to watch it but if you want,skip the fillers and watch it after you finish the anime,ok,naruto have a little to more boring episodes who fell like fillers,like the episod where sakura and ino fight and naruto vs kiba episod.I cant recomand you to watch it but I cant stop you watching,if you want to see why everybody say this anime is to cool you probable will regret or you will become a naruto fan who name black clover femboys personas who say boruto cant beat Asta.",8

                If I'd watched this when it was coming out instead of for the first time in 2020 maybe I'd be like nostalgic enough to enjoy it more in 2020. 
I technically have not finished this series as my girlfriend insisted we not watch almost any of the filler, I think we watched like a couple filler episodes she felt were alright but otherwise we skipped filler. This rating would probably be lower if we had watched the filler from the sounds of it lmao but yeah I'm only technically ""completed"" this series in that I've seen the final episodes and all the non-filler episodes. We
                  started Shippuden which seems better but honestly it's just not gripping me despite that? I think maybe Dragonball and One Piece have spoiled me for quality shonen anime, but I will at SOME point resume Shippuden and maybe revise that a bit. 
Art was (6/10) weak to start and good at the end, nothing phenomenal but it was good for the time by the end. Sound was (6/10) also weak to start and good at the end overall, music was pretty solid even early though. Not PHENOMENAL, but solid. Story was (7/10) alright, characters (8/10) outshine the story itself a bit. 6/10 enjoyment but I'd just finished all of One Piece up to 928 (which was current at the time) when I started this so that might be colouring this, it's just not as enjoyable as even janky early One Piece. There were One Piece filler arcs (which I watched all of) that were en par with some of the weaker episodes in Naruto and One Piece filler isn't usually great. What I've seen of Naruto filler sucks worse than any filler in One Piece tho lmao
idk just comparing other wildly popular shonen anime to Naruto, Dragonball feels stronger as does One Piece
¯\_(ツ)_/¯",7

                anyone knows for sure this anime. This anime has been legendary throughout the world. This anime is the first anime that I watched and I like. interesting storyline, good character development, and interesting jutsu jutsu. there are two minor shortcomings in Naruto anime: too many filler episodes. We all know Naruto has a lot of fillers. It is indeed a good filler to add a storyline so that it does not finish quickly, but there are many fillers in Naruto that are not important / seem artificial. The most filler is in the episode after Naruto vs Sasuke in the Valley of Death. The filler
                  streak until Naruto is finished. in that continuous filler episode, in my opinion it doesn't really matter, because it's too boring and 'doesn't need to be made'. if if Naruto had a few filler episodes, the rating would definitely be high (not below 8).
yeah, indeed the number of fillers in Naruto is indeed boring, especially for fillers that are less important.",8
"
                The show is not as bad as other people says, I really like the premise of the story like this 5 nations or something, the characters, I'm not really connected to them yet but I really like Kakashi's design as well as the Gaara dude from episode 20, the pacing of the show was horrendous a lot of reaction shots and dead air, I'm tired of the Sakura inner voice like it's not even funny. I'll continue to watch this until the shippuden part and let's see how the story goes. The world building looks promising with the 5 nations and such, I really hope
                  I can finish this before the start of my classes.",6
"
                Naruto, I mean at this time in the history of anime everyone who has watched anime or hasn't knows it's name. It's one of the most popular, game changing anime that further introduced the western world to anime, and is considered the archetypes for future Shonen animes such as HXH. But it wasn't my first anime when I was growing up, I watched Doreamon as a kid and that was the only anime I watched but I didn't know Doreamon was an anime until years later but after I moved I got introduced to OPM anime which was popping off at the time and soon
                  enough I heard about Naruto but I never really decided to get into it or into anime in general until years later after I watched AOT. I watched Naruto some of it a little more than a year ago but I forgot why I dropped it after like ep 32. Then I watched a crap load of other animes and here I'm back finally in full circle to finish Naruto.
It's quiet funny but can get a bit too silly at times especially during fights. There is also the emotional impact of the characters a major part of Narutos strong side. Very good dialogue. Very minor flaws. Stereotypical monologuing during fights and super long fights that are dragged on for too long. Consistency and pacing is a bit questionable near the mid-end of the series with the amounts of fillers and the stagnation of the fights. World building is pretty good especially with the inspirations of asian fighting styles, ninjas, and architecture but the technology is kinda confusing. Slight themes here and there not too deep since it's main target audience were for kids but I still enjoyed it. I think in general for older people who haven't grown up with this series Naruto might be a hit or miss for most of them.
Characterization is on point and is one the best things about this series. Not only do we care about the main characters they manage us to care about supporting characters to villains to minor characters in such a short period of time. Sakura has so much raw potential but is always cast aside most of the time and acts like a stereotypical female anime character most of the time. Naruto and Sasuke dynamics and themselves are during the beginning of the series It has amazing development and how they change over time is well done.
The opening and ending themes are great and are consistent for the most part. With great music which is probably one of the most memorable from any anime I have watched. The use of different instruments from different music is such as rock, techno and some uses of Asian instruments. The voice acting cast is probably one of my favorites from any anime. The animation is really good for an anime this old though a but definitely inconsistent at times. The animation of the fights are amazing and the face expressions are hilarious. The costume designs are sick and the set designs are pretty good for it's time.",7
"
                This is when the series is still about Ninjas and not overpowered wizards...
Naruto is an unique anime,not some that you watch and cry for 10 minutes and forget about. It's like a journey watching it, watching the characters grow and get stronger. It's not the best anime ever,but it's an anime that would always have a special place in my heart.
Story:6/10
Story might seems simple on the surface but no,not at all. I am not gonna spoil since I want you to watch it for yourself. The only reason I am putting it only as 6 because the fillers are simply a pain in the head
                  to watch.
Art:10/10
The characters are drawn the way we the fans like it,mostly consistent and not skimping on the super hard to draw parts(Mostly some insane jutsus and some characters). Naruto manga's art consistently ranks as one of the best and the anime inherited it as well.
Sound:7/10
The opening are usually great and closing are the averages ones you expect. Though closing 4 is abhorrent and makes me want to rip my ears off,so 7.
Character:10/10
I don't think I really have to explain this,Naruto's character development go a long way.
Enjoyment and Overall:8/10
Well,10/10 if it wasn't the fillers and that abhorrent ending.",8
"
                I just found out that you can rate animes so Naruto is my first anime even though I never knew what was anime and I watched it on English dub.
It was a great show, the storyline is good, the sounds, art is fine, and the only thing I hate a bit about the show is that it has so much flashbacks. So the more I watch the episodes and flashbacks continues  I cringe about the it so ye thats it.
This my first review and the site says to make a longer reveiw Idk why but I really enjoyed the showed and back then I
                  didn't have any clue that its popular and people talk about it and how much they enjoy the show. So ye I thought it was good for me to keep it myself because I might get bullied for watching something childish and stuff based on the picture lol.",7
"
                The show was pretty old which made the art mark go down. Naruto is really good show because you can really learn a lot about friendships and other stuff like that. The storyline was good but in my opinion a bit too stretched out but somehow i was still engaged. Narutos character developments along with all the other characters was good. THey matured and grew stronger (and slightly funnier). The sound was also okay at the start again, thats ebacuse of the year the anime was made. I started watching it on a whim but it somehow catches you after the first or second episode.
                  I still do think it still is a bit overhyped because after a little while you could start to loose interest.",7
"
                Naruto has a lot of great potential to be a decent story but is just wayyy to bloated with filler. Most people just say to just skip the filler and not count it in the score, but you can't ignore that it's there and rate it perfectly. If I was rating Naruto by the average episode, I'd rate it worse, but I'm giving it a little fairness, because you can just skip the filler. What you can't skip, however, is how bloated every single episode is, even non filler episodes. Naruto should've been ~60 episodes. Without filler, there are 131 episodes of Naruto, which is
                  just way too much. It kills the pacing completely. The manga for Naruto isn't great either. I remember sorta liking this in middle school, but I can't get back into re-watching it just by how LONG it takes to do anything. Even a show that seems like it takes a long time, like Jojo part 3, is nothing compared to this show. I can't even go rewatch cool fights or anything. This could be a 8/10 if it was brought back Fullmetal Alchemist style. I don't even care enough to watch Shippuden because of how long it is, and by how much plain better shows there are. Don't waste your time.",5
"
                This was so hyped but dragged so much. I skipped the filler but it still sometimes dragged. There were things which either didn't make sense or things resolved with what I and everyone else calls talk no jutsu. The pacing can sometimes be awful and sometimes the animation can be really bad, not to mention there are barely any female characters with good writing and in the end just get sidelined to be a characters wife in the end of the story. The worst part about all this is that the main characters goal for the whole story is to become hokage and you don't
                  even get to see that in the main show. The show is also very predictable at times such as when Naruto attacks he always uses the same attacks over again or kurama loses control. Another example is that every villain which nearly wins stops being evil just because of the same speech Naruto gives to each of them in nearly every arc. The war arc drags on for too long and the final villain came out of nowhere, I'd much rather have a last battle between Madara and team 7. My positives on Naruto are that there are some genuinely good characters and arcs this is especially with the first series before Shippuden. I liked the arc with Zabuza and Haku, tournament arc, Sasuke retrieval arc and I thought it was amazing but because there is so much filler after those arcs it honestly makes the show look worse than it actually is which is an unfortunate error on the producers side. Naruto Shippuden on the other hand took two or three whole canon arcs for me to start enjoying the show properly again. I thought things were getting more boring and slow. Then the story started kicking in with the Itachi plot and the pain arc which is my favourite arc of the show and the arc before the war arc was really good as well and I have absolutely no problems with them. Eventually this so hyped up war arc had begun and about a good 50% of it dragged as things I couldn't care about kept showing up but than there were other things I really liked such as Obito and Madara, Naruto and Sasuke joining forces, Kakashi vs Obito, might guy vs Madara but that's just about it. Eventually towards the end of the show became my favourite and final fight between Naruto and Sasuke which was epic as heck and honestly emotional as heck as well and I honestly think it was the best part of the entire show. Unfortunately after that the show really Lacks in entertainment but it was a ride of mixed feelings which is why I think it's only good and nothing more.",7

                <Potential Spoilers>
An anime that’s a part of the big three.
Naruto is by far one of the most influential anime’s released to date. It makes sense as to why this anime is so popular. The narrative explores all kinds of themes and ideas. Brilliant animation that holds up to modern times. It’s the soundtrack that’s become recognizable anywhere. As well as its memorable characters.
The story takes place in a world where ninjas are commonplace. We follow through the perspective of Naruto, a ninja in training. He’s treated as an outcast but sets a goal to be accepted in his village. The anime emphasizes a whole variety
                  of themes that help the cast of characters grow. Themes of willpower, destiny, and unbreakable bonds are key concepts in the narrative.
The animation and art style of Naruto hold up to this day, the animation having smooth character movement and all the cast having great character designs, although in terms of adapting the manga to animation. The anime did a decent job but I can’t help but think the Naruto manga has infinitely better art.
The soundtrack is probably one of the most memorable soundtracks in all of anime. I can guarantee anyone who has seen Naruto will instantly recognize the music from anywhere. Voice acting was great, they all do a great job at portraying the emotions of the characters. I will say however that while the openings are really good, some of them are overrated.
Naruto and Sasuke’s relationship is by far the most highlighted part of Naruto. Both being characters with traumatic pasts, the two represent different paths that you can take when presented with a traumatic past. Sasuke taking what is considered the wrong path and Naruto taking the correct path. Not only is Naruto following the correct path but is also determined to divert Sasuke away from his current path. And there are even more brilliant characters that are presented in this show, like Kakashi, Rock Lee, Zabuza, and Neji. These are only just a few of the memorable characters in the show.
It’s understandable as to why Naruto is a part of the big three. A fun yet deep story presented through its strong animation and art style. As well as, its great sound design and memorable characters.
Overall, I rank this 8/10",8
"
                Just to be clear this is a Review for Naruto, NOT FOR NARUTO SHIPPUDEN.
Naruto is a great story that touches many sentimental topics actually, the emphasis on the sentimental struggles of the characters is really good and you may end up liking many of the cast. The art is not the best and if you are used to seeing new top-quality shonen then this is definitely a downgrade but if you can look past that the fights are actually really good, the fights in naruto are one of their strongest points as they are used not only to used to entertain to but to deepen
                  the characters, the only problem is the many uses of flashbacks. They are overkilled so... sorry about that.
The only thing that may be optional is the last episodes as they are just filler, the filler is not bad but it won´t add anything to the story, this can be bothersome for some people but if you want to have a lose time and not think too much on what you are watching go for it",7
"
                The phenomena of the ""Big 3"" now seems like an eternity ago. Naruto was certainly popular, and it was far and away the shounen I fucked with the most when I was in my early teenage years. But, as with all things, time provides perspective. It's become far more mainstream to express criticism and even derision of old obsessions like Naruto. Common ones include: filler, common and overused tropes, ass pulls, dated aesthetic, poor or little animation and obnoxious characters. 
My personal favourite critique of Naruto has been thematic in it's basis. After all, Naruto's impoverishment and underdog status are huge to the narrative of
                  the series, but was Naruto really an underdog? He hailed from a lineage of gifted Ninja, stumbled upon the secret art of Shadow Clone, has huge mana reserves  (or whatever they call it in Naruto again lol) and was the container for 9 tails. Ninja aristocracy if I've ever seen it. 
I don't disagree with any of those aforementioned critiques. I would find it extraordinarily hard to go back and watch Naruto from the very beginning to the end now. However, I think the creativity of Naruto should not go understated. Ninja villages and ninja arts are still cool. Many of the battles and arcs in Naruto were engaging and had no shortage of good moments. Watching back fights such as Sakura + Granny vs Sasori (from Shippuuden) are still hugely entertaining, even if the quality of the animation isn't top notch throughout.  
I enjoy modern shounen (e.g. Hero Academia and Jujutsu Kaisen), but not many of them have come close to the sense of scale that Naruto had. I also wonder to what degree will my preference for these shounen hold up into the future when I've also developed distance from them as well. Even though I like the cast of Hero Academia, I still haven't watched beyond the first season because I don't feel it necessary and some of the content reads as cringe to me in my geriatric state of 24 years old. Am I just beginning to go off the genre conventions of shounen? Well, no, because HXH is still the best thing since sliced bread. But then again, HXH isn’t exactly representative of the classic shounen formula we all see in shows like Bleach, Naruto and (maybe) One Piece. 
So that’s why Naruto is a 6 to me. There is a mix of the great and the irritating/cringe/plain bad in my mind from watching Naruto. It was certainly fun, but I don’t think I will ever revisit it properly. Even the culling of the filler may not be enough for me to stomach some of the staler elements of Naruto. So long and thanks for all the autists running like Ninjas!",6

                This was my 1st anime so I could be a bit biased. The series is an introduction to the Naruto world. It is the foundation to Shippuden, it is recommended to skip fillers and just follow the canonical part, trust me u are not gonna miss out on much by skipping them, I watched all fillers and barely remember any, a few are fun, whose ep no.s could be found online.
The initial episodes got me interested in the series. The 1st mission was okayish. I dont want to reveal and spoil so I am not gonna use the terms used in the anime.
After 20-30 ep
                  into the anime, few major characters who play an important role in shippuden will be introduced. The sole purpose of this series is to get us into a cliffhanger about what motives each antogonist has. 
There are just a handful of fights which give the adrenaline rush. The comedy part is good enough. I suggest u to skip fillers, complete the series asap and dive into shippuden - skip fillers - and witness the pog arc which starts after around 120ep maybe. Have fun!",6
"
                Naruto is a show that really goes deep down in my heart as my first anime, so I'm going to try to not be biased.
Pros:
Naruto is usually one of the first animes people usually watch, or usually the first out of the big 3 (Bleach, Naruto, One Piece.) Naruto is a show that has everything you need, a decent enough story, the art's decent for a 2006 anime, soundtrack's fucking chef's kiss, and the MC is overall really enjoying.
Naruto has some crazy memorable fights, (cant mention any because of spoilers,) but when you get there, you'd understand.
Naruto's arcs are decently enough seasoned with a bit
                  of everything usually, you have some sort of task you need to do and there's a task, or there's a mission with an antagonist.
All of the villains and side characters have some sort of past that give you some sort of reasoning why they have the intentions.
A good majority of screen time on a majority of characters, and you get a mix of all the experiences in all different varieties.
Cons:
Naruto overall's story is pretty meh, if I were to say, a decent enough story where I can enjoy and look past it.
Naruto's filler's are extremely annoying with about 40% of filler if I remember, and basically not being any sort of entertaining.
One last thing, some back stories are used wayyyyy tooo much (iykyk) and almost are at to the point where you skip a good half of the episode because of some sort of 'shinobi way' and never back downs on their word or some shit, and gets annoying.
Conclusion:
Overall, this show isn't that bad, if you're new to it, I definitely recommend watching it, it's a mix of everything and gave me a shining light to anime and started to where I am now.
(first anime review, any sort of criticism, or any tips would be appreciated.)",8

                [For Brazilian users]
É o seguinte, Naruto é bom, mas nada que se possa comparar com One Piece ou DBZ. Lembrando que não estou falando do Shippuden, e sim do Original. As OSTs de Naruto são incríveis, as melhores que eu já vi, mas existem muitos pontos negativos, e um deles, com certeza são os fillers demasiados.
O clímax de Naruto pra mim, foi o Chuunin Shiken, e depois disso, nada mais valeu a pena ver até a luta Naruto x Sasuke.
E um dos melhores personagens, o Gaara, acaba perdendo o brilho mais no fim do anime.
Mas fora isso, é ótimo, Naruto é um anime que todo
                  otaku deveria assistir. OSTs ótimas, lutas interessantes, histórias bem elaboradas (apesar de não chegarem nem perto de OP) e personagens carismáticos.
Naruto não é perfeito, longe disso, mas todos deveriam assistir!",7
"
                Part 1 is just unbelievably lit. Naruto was my introduction to shounen and I really can't put into words just how fun the series was to watch. 
Naruto wasn't exactly a masterpiece and it had some pitfalls and some pretty boring arcs as a whole package it excels as a being a excellent beginning to a coming of age story. That said.. if you include the filler my overall score would drop to a 5, but its no fun including the filler (who even watches it anyways?).  Spoilers ahead, you've been warned. 
Let's start with the story. Naruto has a fairly typical generic plot,
                  its about an orphaned kid in a world with fantastical powers who wants to be acknowledged. On its own, that's not a big deal, generic plots can be exciting and surprising. What ""makes"" the series is the lore, the background, and the mystery. The series has a very gritty and dark vibe. We know so little about the world but the writers ease us in to shinobi world and give us a glimpse into the culture and techniques readily available. Even in the dark, the world building is done well and it feels real. But more importantly the transitions and the arcs are done well. We see linear growth that makes sense, individual character arcs that connect to and work with other characters and also a power scaling system that makes sense. It's a consistent world. There are definitely certain arcs that outshine others like the chunin exam and konoha crush which just so happen to be my favorite arcs between both part 1 and 2. Than there are slower and less meaningful arcs that sort of break the power scale. The pacing can be slow and pretty boring too; learning the rasengan was probably my least favorite part of the show. But ignoring essentially just 1 arc, pretty much everything is fun and exciting. Nothing to crazy or special happens, but it's consistent and builds the correct atmosphere. 
The characters of naruto are enjoyable. I love naruto-- his bumbling and just fucking do it personality appeal to me a lot. a lot of people don't like him but how could you not like the most abrasive under dog of all time. Each character has there own journey and have there own unique skills that are fun to watch. Every battle, every technique, every action is planned. The dynamic between sasuke and naruto is exciting and watching them push each other is extremely. As a whole, all the characters make things interesting. 
As far as the sound and art, I'm not too sure what to say. But I can say that narutos orange jump suit contrasts very hard with everything else. Watching this orange smiling guy in this extremely dark landscape  is really bizzare, it's hard to believe his character, let alone his bright orange jumpsuit, is the main character of the show. But he is and he some how fits in. The music the matches the very gritty tone I was talking about earlier and it compliments it well. In fact it plays a large role in building that dark vibe. 
Ok let's wrap this up. Part 1 is signifcantly better than part 2, shippuden is pretty bad so maybe it's clouding my judgement some how. But honestly, naruto is a solid 7/10. I enjoy this series a lot and I come back to watch the fights and some of the funny moments. Sometimes you have to let go of your quality control and just allow yourself to walk into this world and it becomes significantly easier to enjoy the show. The series is built to make that process easy. Whatever happens, come the future or whatever, I'm sure I will continue to love this show even knowing the fact that boruto and shippuden exists.",7

                Naruto is one of the most popular anime out there. It was a phenomenon, with thousands of fans worldwide. This also means that it garners unwarranted hate. Personally, I enjoyed Naruto. Sure, there were moments where I was annoyed by some silly moments, or frustrated with the length of some fights, but I think that Naruto is a solid, entertaining anime nevertheless. Unless the aforementioned things turn you off.
Story (7/10): The story is basic, you have shinobi(ninjas) who use chakra to use different techniques(which are basically superpowers). They live in hidden villages and go on various missions, some of them really dumb(like catching cats) and
                  some befitting the term 'shinobi'(assassination and stuff). 
While the plot is predictable, the storylines are interesting and are varied. They lead to some really hype fights that are executed well. The problem with the plot is that it tends to drag sometimes, especially during the fights. Another problem is that they stop in the middle of the fight to talk(Talk no Jutsu). I have mixed feelings about this because while it reveals some characters' backstories and throw some light on why they are what they are, it feels nonsensical that they would just stop fighting and stand there talking about what they believe in. It also mostly follows the ""train, then fight"" formula, which I don't really have much of a problem with. There's always some new kind of technique that lead to creative fights(unless it's Naruto with Kyuubi chakra). Some arcs deal with themes such as friendship and what it takes to be a shinobi, and I feel like Naruto really shines at writing psychological conflict(especially the Land of Waves arc). Sometimes flashbacks are repeated over and over again to the point where it's tiring(I get it Naruto, you were alone your whole childhood). The humor is very hit or miss here, so it might or might not be to your taste.
Art (7/10): It was a weekly show, so the production value really shows. There are some really well animated fights(Rock Lee vs Gaara for eg).But for every fight, there's poorly animated shinobi jumping in awkward arcs on tree branches. Okay, maybe I'm nitpicking there. There are a lot of still frames and reaction shots in the fights. Most charcters and character models are fresh and consistent respectively, except Tsunade.  The way she's drawn is realy inconsistent.
Sound (9/10): I loved the soundtrack. Some people say the music is 'tribal' and isn't all that good, but I thought it was really cool and catchy. I loved the emotional music they used too. I think the voice actors did a good job of conveying the emotions of the characters. I especially liked Orochimaru's and Kakashi's voices, they were unique. Naruto's 'dattebayo' was tiring at first, but it grew on me. 
Characters (9/10): My favourite aspect of Naruto is its characters. They all have different quirky characteristics. Except the young female characters. they just wanna get with the boys. Lots of side characters have development(Neji, Rock Lee, Gaara, etc) making them endearing. The psychological conflict really comes into play when characters interact and/or fight. For example, 'Rock Lee vs Gaara' was basically hard work vs born talent. I think Sasuke gets a lot of hate for being emo. Well, I kinda agree about his personality but I like his character a lot. Again, I don't really like his personality, but rather his character. Don't really care much about Sakura here tho.
Overall (8/10): I enjoyed watching this anime, I skipped the fillers though so I wouldn't know anything about them(except for the Kakashi mask filler). As for the canon material, iI think t is solid and entertaining and makes for an entertaining watch.",8

                Naruto Classic has a good story and a good character development, but an absurd mess with repetitive flashbacks, about 10 minutes of each episode is just flashback, there are many fillers too, but here in the classic they are not a problem, since they just appear at the end of the anime, when the story has already been told, you can jump and go straight to the final episode if you want.
Anyway, it's a good anime, it's not that ""masterpiece"" that people say, Naruto is extremely overrated, but it's good. things only get worse in Shippuden ...
As much as it has a good start, it
                  goes to Shippuden, and to avoid possible fr, I do not recommend it.",7
"
                Hmm, this anime was the one that got me into anime, but ive got some things I wanna say.
Most characters have an awesome backstory, the cool ones at least. For the sound, I watched in dubbed so I probably didn't get the full effect. 
Naruto is overall good with good ideas and all, but If you're looking for funny and bright shows like Fairy Tail, this isn't really the place. Some of the fights give me quite a dark vibe. This is quite binge-worthy though and has a lot of lore in it, so if you want an anime with lore, this one is good
                  for you. I cant give a proper review as this is for child Naruto, but this is what I have about it.
I personally watched the fillers because at the time I didn't know what they were, but some were pretty goofy and I liked most.",8
"
                This show is enjoyable to watch, but the shear amount of fillers it has makes it less enjoyable...
I gave the story of Naruto: Shonen Jump a 5 out of 10 mainly because the show has so many filler episodes, that I almost forgot the main original flow of the story. I know very well why this show has many fillers, but wataching this for the first time again more than 15 to 20 years after its first release just doesn't sit well enough for me...
A 7 out of 10 for the art style and design. This is the advantage of watching an old anime, everything
                  is hand drawn, little emphasis on the usage of CG, especially when a serious scenario takes place, e.g. fight scenes...
An 8 out of 10 for the sound. The sound are pretty iconic, mainly the background music, sound effects, iconic dialogues and most importantly, the opening and ending song. These created a whole generation of fans, and from just hearing the iconic songs like ""Haruka Kanat"", ""Kanashimi wo Yasashisani ni"", or ""Viva Rock (Japanese Side)"", or ""Harumonia"" creates a nostalgic feels...
I gave a low score 4 out of 10 for the character. There are a lot of memorable characters, but the reason I gave it such a low score are because the of filler arcs it has, resulting in a bunch of forgettable characters (filler characters). Like I said in the story, the amount of filler arcs it has becomes detrimental to the main story telling of the show...
I give it a 6 out of 10 for the enjoyment. Though it is fun to watch the show, the main reason why I gave it such a low score is because of the filler arcs, where you feel like the story is finally progressing, but in actuality, is still a filler arc...
I give Naruto: Shonen Jump a 6 out of 10. I have mentioned numerous times about the fillers of the show, but overall, the show is just fine, memorable, nostalgic, but lots of skippable fillers.",6
"
                As a kid I always ignored Naruto (actually I ignored anime in general), and even after many years, I was still doubtful if I was ever going to watch it due to the huge amount of episodes, most of them being filler. But after hearing and watching so many good things about Naruto and N. Shippuden on YouTube, it got me interested.
I searched a list with all the filler episodes so I could know when to skip them and started watching the first two episodes (in the original language).
I hated it. The animation was very bad in my opinion, Naruto was annoying, and the story
                  was uninteresting. But since I don't like judging a series by its first episode, I kept watching it. And honestly, it turned a lot better with each episode.
 As the series progressed, the story got a lot more entertaining and interesting (and I found out a lot of similarities with My Hero Academia, which made me reconsider my love towards that other anime, but that's another story). Some of the things I loved were the concepts of the Chakra, the Jutsus, the different nations, and the world-building. Each character and village had different ways and styles of using their Chakra, making the combat scenes more fun and interesting because the combats focused more on techniques and strategy instead of just using punches and kicks.
The characters were also really nice. Each one of them had some interesting backstory, good design, and great development and chemistry with the rest of the cast (except for Sakura, I found her really annoying). Even though the overuse of flash-backs bugged me, they added a lot of emotion and development to most scenes and characters. 
Being a story targeted for kids, the show relies too much on repetitive jokes that lose their fun after the fifth time they are told, but at least they don't ruin the emotion of the best scenes.
I think skipping the filler episodes was a good decision because there is really no need to add more stories to this series. That being said, I look forward to Naruto Shippuden!",8

                No spoilers; read away and wage a keyboard war as you wish!
I have seen all of Naruto, Naruto Shippūden, and all of the manga canon episodes of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, and even though it is my first and favorite anime, I'm going to give it a nuanced and unbiased review.
We'll start with my objective inferences, and pointing out that I am mainly a slice-of-life watcher, more than a Shonen action watcher.
I think it's fair to say that the Onbaa in the room is definitely filler. This is a review of the anime, not the manga, and yes, the filler definitely brings it down overall
                  from a 9 to an 8 (that's being generous, too) for me, so I'll just get that out of the way now, so I don't have to keep bringing it up.
Story: Objectively, I think the story deserves a solid 7. It is a really good story, albeit a little bit cliché. But that doesn't mean it's bad. With the way all three shows go about presenting the plot events and building tensions, this show is insanely rewatchable. I would know because I've re-watched it almost three times now. I loved the Land of Waves Escort Mission arc. It did drag on a little long, but it was a great start, and they did have to do a lot of explaining of things like the Sharingan, chakra related things, etc. The Chūnin Exams? Cliché. I've only seen a couple Shonen action anime and I even I know it's cliché. It's definitely very captivating and entertaining though. The Konoha Crush arc was good, no complaints. Interesting techniques, and fights, with funny moments in there. The search for Tsunade was okay. Unlike most of the fanbase, I really don't care for Tsunade, I get that it's ha-ha funny that she has fucking Z-cup titties, but she doesn't do very well making me care about her. But the arc had some great fights, like the bouts with Itachi and the three-way deadlock was fabulous, followed by the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, which was a 9 and a half for me, I loved that arc, and how they built up tension for the Sasuke fight and in my opinion, totally delivered; the fight was heart-wrenching for me.  I also LOVE how deep most of the lore runs, like the origins of the Dōjutsu, but that's more of a thing in Shippūden, so it doesn't contribute to my rating.
Art: an 8 in my opinion. It definitely wasn't bad. They had some moments where the characters looked a little bit questionable, but that falls under animation, and I don't know if animation counts as art, but the reason I give the art an 8 is that I love the color palette, the character design, and the Jutsu, and how it plays into the imagery. Each (main, and canon) character has a unique and intricate design, to the point where you can distinguish them based on their silhouettes, and everything is so brightly colored and sticks out in its own way, even the outfits represent their characters, like how Sasuke wears a neat and organized shirt with shorts, and Naruto wears a baggy, impractical jumpsuit. Also the great art makes the openings and endings so easy to watch, and along with the songs they use makes the openings/endings unrivaled compared to everything I've watched so far. 
Sound: now the sound is my absolute favorite part of the series. It is definitely objectively a 10. I've already went over how the openings/endings have great art, but they have even greater songs in my opinion. Songs like Haruka Kanata by ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION, and Go!!! by FLOW perfectly encompass the spirit of Naruto, and go along with the art and sound to make 1 minute and 30 seconds of audio/visual greatness. And then there's the soundtrack. I just love every song of the soundtrack. For example the main theme. To me, as an American guitarist who is very hands-on with music, I love how it blends traditional Eastern Asian music elements like the Pentatonic scale, along with traditional Japanese instruments like the Shamisen with really distorted guitar, or the piano with Fue (bamboo flutes), and all of the music soundtracks do a really good job helping to set the mood and intensify the scenes. As well as the silly songs, the show has wonderful sound. I'm not sure if voice acting is a part of this, but it has excellent voice acting in both sub and dub, which is pretty rare in my experience. Zero complaints with the music whatsoever.
Characters: the characters are pretty good. I know at this point this probably seems like a typical Naruto Hypebeast's review but all of this is the things that stick out to me, I'm not just trying to gas the show up, and be annoying. I give the characters an 8 though. Each character has their own unique personality, and traits, and voice, and they all stick to them pretty well. The villains are nearly unrivaled (again this is more of a Shippūden observation, what with the Akatsuki and such) but Itachi, Orochimaru, and Zabuza & Haku are still mostly unrivaled in my experience and they make prevalent appearances. The character development is good, with some clichés, you know like the main character learning an overpowered technique really quickly (Rasengan), and things like that, but it didn't affect my opinion significantly.
Enjoyment: 6. Even though this review has mainly been hyping the show up, it is pretty hard to enjoy this show as a whole, you know because of the 80 or so filler episodes that appear as one big stretch spanning 41% of the show, immediately after one of the most heart-wrenching and serious moments in the show.  If you're watching Canon only then yes, this is definitely an 8 or above, but this IS a review of the whole anime. Some filler is good, but filler is filler is filler, and none of it comes really close to competing with the actual canon material, which is why I opt to skip it most of the time, though I have seen all of the filler in this show. 
Overall: I would say this show objectively deserves a 7.83, which is the average of all of my individual aspect ratings, which I'll round up to an 8. I have it rated as a 9 because that is my subjective opinion, and it's inflated because it is my first and favorite anime, and it helped me through some seriously rough times.
All in all, I'm not saying you should watch it, but I am saying you won't regret it. If you haven't started yet, make sure you bookmark https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/naruto though. And if you want to watch filler, take your time with it, because I genuinely almost dropped the show trying to speed through the filler. And if you think it's overhyped, at least give it a genuine try before going and confronting people about liking it.",8
"
                To be honest, Naruto is the most overhyped show in existence. Everyone goes on and on and on about how great it is; and my expectations for this show was equally high. However, I was really, really let down. Really. This wasn't the best show ever, as I had thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, the show is enjoyable, but it's definitely not among the best shows out there. I hope Shippuden will better than this... much better.
The concept of this show isn't that hard to follow. It's an alternate world in which ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and
                  they have this power flowing inside of them called chakra. Chakra is used to perform powerful attacks which (usually) belongs to either of the five traditional elements of earth, fire, water, air and lightning. Of course, since they are ninjas, they fight with weapons like shuriken and kunai as well as hand-to-hand combat. As expected of this kind of world, there's evil people, having different goals and reasons behind their evil.
The story follows Naruto, one of these ninjas, as he grow as a ninja, from being a stupid little prank-playing brat to becoming a fine ninja. Along the way, he interacts with and makes friends with many fellow ninja, fighting his way towards his dream of becoming Hokage (the leader of his village).
The story isn't nearly as good as the concept would indicate. Sure, a lot of the characters has some nice background stories, won't complain about that, but they manage to drag out everything so much. It really annoys me. Some fights take several episodes when they could've been done them just as good in one or two. There's also way too much fighting. The story goes like fight, fight, background story, fight, fight, even more fight, half an episode's worth of resting or journeying, fight, fight, and so on. I mean, it's cool to watch fights, but there are just way too many fights, and they drag most of them out to unnecessary lengths. The only really enjoyable fight was the one between Sasuke and Naruto right before the fillers began. Which brings up another thing...
Fillers! Agh, I normally don't mind fillers, but Naruto had some really, really stupid ones. Sure, there was the occasional diamond among the charcoal, but that doesn't excuse the high amount of bad fillers. I mean, just because they are fillers doesn't mean that they have to make them bad. Several shows have actually made decent and at the same time long fillers (especially Bleach, with its 40-episode long Bount arc), but Naruto failed horribly here.
Also, I feel that Naruto is very silly at times. Silly is usually good, but not when it's immature silly. And guess what+ Naruto is silly in an immature way. It's so dreadfully stupid at times that I had to close my eyes, take a deep breath and wait until it got serious again. Now, it did have some good comical moments, but those were far and wide between.
Another thing I feel like releasing my rage on is the animation. It barely manages to get the description &ldquo;average&rdquo; to me. At its best, it's slightly above average. However, a lot of time it's slipshod galore with the animation. I still have many very bad memories from having to watch lots of errors in the animation, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get rid of those memories. While the amount of errors decreased as the episodes passed by, at least every second episode before the 100s had one or more moments of slipshod animation. Wonder if they ever considered firing the animators.
As a side mention, they should do something about Rock Lee - even though I've slightly gotten used to his horrible looks, I still feel a burn in the back of my eye every time I see him.
The music is pretty good, though. A lot of great tunes (especially the sad ones are great), and the first few OPs and EDs were pretty awesome. It has some really bad music parts too, like the tribal voice-ish song, and sometimes they could've used better themes during the fights. As the series progressed, the quality of the OPs and EDs decrease too.
The characters are fairly okay, I guess. Some of them are really annoying, like Naruto, because he's so stupid. Agh, he annoys me to no end! Some other characters are annoying too, because of things like their looks (Gai and Lee), or because they are failed attempts at comical relief (at least in my eyes, you might find them funny), like the all too perverted Jiraiya.
That's the negative about them. However, they have some really nice background stories, some which are elaborated more upon than others. Many of the characters also get fair amounts of screen time, which for some people can seem too much, whilst others will be content with it, because their favorite character from the show gets an episode for him/herself.
I also like the fact that most of them have dreams or aspirations, and motives for what they are doing and how they are acting (usually it's tied together with their background stories). The growing relationships between them is also nice, their maturing, and how Naruto is slowly getting accepted by more and more people through hard work.
Basically, they've portrayed the characters very well, and not too over the top, but some of them act stupid and silly from time to time, which drags the character rating down.
I have some mixed feelings for the show, which kind of drags down on the enjoyability factor of it. Great concept, not as good story, both good and bad music, horrid animation at times, many characters with background stories, some of them great and some not-so-great; it's hard to completely make up my mind, but I believe the ratings I have given shows my feelings towards the different aspects of the show.
Of course, even though there was things I didn't like, I can easily see why this show is so popular as it is; it has humor that the kids may find funny, as well as lots of fights which appeal to the teenagers and adults. I personally didn't like it that much, though. I'm looking forward to Shippuden, because I&rsquo;ve heard it was much better&hellip; I really hope so!

                Really, really iconic Anime which at its best is one of the finest examples of both compeling and epic storytelling and at its worst a plain, test-endurance experience.
The filler is what really kills the flow of things, with sidestories that fail to keep up with the main plot, however, the characters are so endearing and their development so well written  (...In most cases at least) that's it's really hard for me to criticize their weak-points by calling them deal breakers. 
If you were to give this series a chance, i'm sure you'll find a lot to love about Naruto, just don't expect it to
                  be the so called Masterpiece everyone used to talk about.",7
"
                This was the first anime I ever watched, so I have a lot of nostalgia for it, however, I acknowledge that it isn't that good. I like the soundtrack, designs, and stories a lot overall but a lot of the other elements deserve plenty of criticism. The misogyny in the writing of the female characters is one of the worst things about the show. As many people have pointed out, the girls are almost always losing and have to depend on men a lot while the male characters are almost always winning as long as they're the hero and rarely ever depend on the women
                  in the series. The female characters are also constantly oversexualized, which can be seen the most frequently with Tsunade who is constantly the center of sexual jokes and comments. After the characters have kids, almost all the girls are housewifes which is quite strange considering how many of them loved their job and are quite headstrong. Shikamaru also seems to still make a lot of misogynistic comments when he's with Temari which doesn't make a lot of sense since everytime he said something like that around her, she gets super angry. The misogyny also makes a lot of the men seem gay which is honestly quite funny. The writing also seems to go down in quality after the first couple of arcs and the arcs also seem to be stretched out longer than they should be. Their also seem to be a lot of characters deaths that add barely anything to the story, such a Neji. The characters decisions later on in the story regarding their romance and children also seem to make no sense considering their personalities and everything they've experienced. Despite all of these things I dislike about the series, it still manages to be very enjoyable which is surprising and has plenty of good elements that occasionally make me forget about all the bad things about the series. So taking into consideration all of the bad and good ones, I would rate this series a 6.8/10.",7
"
                Here is a very honest review of my experience with this show, gonna keep it short and simple....
Ive tried watching Naruto MANY MANY times by my friends recommendations and the fact that I grew up watching this show. Once I got older and saw many more anime I knew I just had to come back to this one, the first few times around I could never get into it I thought this show was bland and just horrible to what I remembered. It felt slow and just so painfully boring to watch, that being said after dropping the show so many times one day I
                  finally just forced myself to watch it and really pay attention, it was weird a show I just couldn't enjoy I was enjoying? maybe it was because I finally got into more episodes of the story but I absolutely loved it. The fillers are questionable but overall I loved it, the mixed reviews on here are understandable because I've been both but in the end I think if you just really watch the show its something worth the time.",8
"
                I,m a huge fan of ninjas you know, but the first season is almost a filler and it,s just
showing you the rules of NARUTO,s world. The whole story is just an introduction
and nothing els.
The art and animation is average but it gets better when the time moves forward.
The characters are good but they,re almost holding back. you can see it in the fight scenes. its just an easy way to make the story longer and waste the time.
season one is almost full of naruto,s sexy  jutsu
As a man that grew up with naruto for almost 12 years. I definitely recommend the manga.
I read the
                  manga and its much way better than the anime. Because of the censorship and studio,s budget & policies, the animation is awful in some specific scenes. So i highly recommend you to read the manga and stop wasting your time.720 Episodes ain,t worth it at all.",5
"
                Naruto, in my opinion, is a bit overrated, why? because it is not really that extraordinary, at least the first season
Story: it's about a ninja boy who has a dream to be the best, practically hokage.
In this anime we can see the so-called ""power of friendship"", there are fights, ninjas, martial arts, a bit emotional, we learn that Naruto is alone, without friends or family, but in the end he makes a lot of friends and in the second season even a family.
The characters : naruto the main character, he has a ""fox"" in him, it gives him strength, and along the way he learns
                  to control it. 
Kakashi, he is the ""black sheep"", he owns a sharingan, he is an extraordinary teacher who will later become hokage
A genius, Shikamaru, he always has something in mind and a good plan 
The girls who are also present (with small hentai scenes). The girls in this anime are even stronger than they seem, or than other characters are. 
Rivals, and many others who appear and complicate their situations and the list goes on. We find out that these rivals want to take Naruto and take the nine-tailed beast out of him
Sound: The music, I think anyone who has watched several animes has heard the ""blue bird"" at least once, is by far the best. And when it comes to fighting in these anime, it's worth putting on your headphones and letting the anime go. And the opening and ending themes are quite enjoyable and addictive
Enjoyment: at first I really liked naruto, I didn't want to know that there are better animes than this one, but it's not like that, in the end you realize that it's a bit overrated, I'm not saying it's not good, it remains one of the best animes and even one of my favorites. I can say that if you want a long, good anime, a little emotional and even with fights, where you have to become stronger to be the best, you can start watching Naruto, DON'T WAIT ANYMORE 
Overall : Naruto deserves it, from the story to the sound, it's a very good anime, 8/10",8

                A good story with a diverse cast of characters that is plagued by the constant need for recaps, flashbacks and all sorts of unnecessary fillers.  
First the negatives, the end of the first Naruto series are all fillers and honestly unnecessary to watch (they are ok, however not necessary to understand the larger story).  There are also a few fillers within the other episodes, however none of them are as bad as the end of the series.  These fillers begin when Naruto leaves to train.  This series has a tendency to waste time by telling, retelling, flashback and all sorts of
                  tricks to go over the same plot point over and over again.  At one point an event happened, moments later they talked about that event, then they had a flashback to that event, then the talked about it again.  Later on in the same episode, they had a full recap of that event and flashed back to it again.  The sad thing is that event wasn't even that big of a deal.  This was the worse case I came across, however it still demonstrates the point that this show likes to waste time.  The characters are often hit or miss depending on the viewer, I personally could not stand Sasuke (the second main character).  I have heard a lot of people hate the main character, however the upside is there is a wide variety of characters and Im sure you will like somebody.
The positive, the story is full of interesting characters that are intertwined with one another.  Unfortunately the majority of these relationships are not fully explained until the sequel of this series.  Even though most of these relationships are not fully explored, this series still does a great job of introducing you to the characters, their background and who they are in the larger scheme of things.  The action is creative and fun to watch.  One of the best parts is when a new character is introduced, they almost always have some sort of ""speciality"" or ability that makes them uniquely different from the rest of the cast.  Watching them fight and seeing their different abilities is always entertaining, especially when their ability somehow correlates with their story.  This series has some great villains and a well developed story for most of them.  There is a high degree of lineage to the story as a whole, and that just continues to grow as the show progress.  This is a great quality because almost everything that happens during the present, has some roots to the pass and in some cases, directly affect the near future.
As a whole this story has great characters, a well developed storyline and entertaining action sequences that ultimately exemplify the key characteristics of the individuals within that fight.  However for all of the great qualities this show has, it also has the tendency of watering down the experience by revisiting the exact same scene over and over again.
I recommend this to anyone who has the ability to put up with fillers in the form of episodes, as well as constant time wasters such as flashbacks.  To anyone who can put up with the insane amount of fillers, they will get to experience a fun and vast storyline filled with a great cast of characters.",7

                this is prime naruro and what shippuden should have had.
BATTLES:
the og naruto has some of the most classic and memorable fights in a very long time and still hold up today. the fight focus on more strategy rather than i have more chrakra then you so i win. all of the jutsus are so unique and the characters use their abilites to their potential. theres actual team work like in the zabuza arc where naruto and sasuke work together. 
ARCS:
the land of waves arc is my favorite in the whole series because it ha s agreat villian and it shows teamwork bewteen team 7. the
                  ending is horribly sad and was unpredicted for such and old childrens show. the characters are interesting and theres a fair amount of character progression and really shows you some of the world which is always fun
the chunin exams is amazing and when talking about the best anime arcs this arc will be brought up several times because how good it is. it showed ninja of other villages and really shows off the side characters and what they can do which lead to an amazing fight bewteen rock lee and gaara. it inroduces orochimaru which is a great villan and sets up the curse mark which is big in this story
the rest are also great where they show off more of the side characters and some more. it introduces ssunade and jiraya which is great and are amazing characters.",8

                Naruto is one of those animes that everyone has heard about even if you've never watched anime in your life. It's also one of the animes that has ASTOUNDING amounts of potential with the concept. However, the story itself falls far short of what it could be sadly. The fact that this anime is 220 episodes with a sequel anime that has 300+ episodes or something is pretty much the reasoning behind that: They milked this WAY too hard.
There are a lot of truly good moments for this anime, but after Sasuke escapes the leaf village, things start going downhill. It's been a while since
                  I watched Naruto, but I can hardly even remember most of the stuff after that other than the Isarabi(Spelling) arc thing where they meet the fish girl and save her from the evil group/the villagers who hate her, mainly because that was the ONLY good filler arc I found. 
What's worse: The fillers don't matter in shippuden at all. It's over 100 episodes of pointless fluff.
That being said, the story could be improved even without the fillers: The potential is there for this to be a giant success, but they limited themselves in the story department to make way for action scenes and a bunch of fighting.
The character development is good, but can be improved on. A lot of characters are flat out predictable whether you like them or not, and interactions can be cheesy due to the attempted comedy where it didn't need to be.
For new anime watchers I would recommend watching Naruto or at least trying it out: It truly is a decent anime, but it could've been a lot better than it is.
