                The lack of popularity surrounding Hunter x Hunter (2011) has always confused me, especially after catching up to it six months ago. For an anime that seems to do everything right, it isn't talked about a lot at a popular level. Neither has it been successful in garnering a fan base similar to that of SNK or SAO. I decided to write this review to do the show justice. If a show this good is still flying under your radar or if you are discouraged from watching this because of its ""childish appearance"" then reading this review is a must.
Story:
HxH is about a young boy
                  named Gon who embarks on a journey to find his father. After learning that his father left him at a young age to become a Hunter, Gon decides to follow in his footsteps not only to find him, but also to see what was so special about the profession that made his father choose it over him. Although a story of finding one's father is simple, it is the path that is taken towards this end that makes the series truly special. HxH is made up of several arcs that are all extremely well-written, which brings me to the best part of the series, the writing. Hunter x Hunter (2011) boasts one of the finest writing in the world of shonen; the depth and flow of the story, enthralling characterizations, strong dialogue and impressive world-building are all crafted into a fascinating tale that can absorb viewers into lengthy marathons. 
The amount of variety that is packed into HxH's story is also very impressive. HxH successfully dabbles in several genres in six story arcs tackling survival, fighting tournaments, crime thriller, virtual realities, war and politics. Not only that, the series is also able to undergo significant tonal shifts with ease (light to dark and vice versa). Sometimes, these shifts in tone occur after an arc ends though other times, it even occurs mid-arc. Another thing about HxH is that its arcs are connected with one another, with each arc naturally following the one before it. This creates a natural transition that highlights what the series really is, a journey. As for pacing and development, they are excellent. For the most part, HxH is very well paced. The series does a fantastic job at keeping its viewers engaged, time will fly by as you watch most episodes and you'll find yourself breezing through the show. Excluding two recap episodes, HxH has no filler episodes. Due to this, story progression is solid with the plot moving forward with each episode.
Although HxH initially gives off a light hearted impression, it gives off a good one. Not the kind of “light heartedness” that makes you say “this is childish and below me” but the kind that appeals to everyone. HxH gives off that classic and charming shonen vibe that has been lost in recent years, and it does so with its head held up high. Eventually though, the series takes a dark turn. Although most HxH story arcs are light hearted, both Yorknew and the Chimera Ant arc are two of the best and darkest arcs shonen has to offer. Yorknew can be described as a dark thriller in a big city. The central theme of the arc is revenge and it is similar to Death Note in terms of thrill and atmosphere. On the other hand, the Chimera Ants arc can be described as an attempt by the Hunters Association to control an outbreak of a dangerous man-eating species. It is the darkest and most thematically powerful arc in the series tackling themes such as identity, human nature and survival of the fittest. The arc has drawn comparisons to Yu Yu Hakusho’s Chapter Black for its seinen-like nature and is similar to Shingeki no Kyojin, where the protagonists experience a strong sense of despair in the face of a vastly superior, hostile species. The series undergoes major tonal shifts in both arcs with the color palette, music, atmosphere and amount of violence changing significantly. 
However, what sets the series apart from other battle anime is its unorthodoxy and unpredictability. Shonen tropes and storytelling methods are undermined throughout the series. The main character for example, Gon, fails more than he succeeds. Power-ups based on emotion or willpower are non-existent and fighting in the series is radically different from other battle anime. The main protagonist is not the main focus of every arc either. At certain points in the series, you could even say that Gon has taken a supporting role, especially during the later portions of the CA arc where he isn't given as much focus due to the grand scope of the story. The standard battle anime formula of “lose-train-win” is also undermined. Although there is training, it does not always translate to a victory, nor does it propel the protagonists over or to the same level as their main adversaries in terms of strength. For the most part, the protagonists assume the underdog role. Although they have incredible potential, they are still kids who have a lot to learn. In terms of storytelling, unpredictable developments are commonplace. One thing that continues to amaze me with this show is how it leads viewers into thinking that the story will progress in this direction, only to change course and arrive at a completely different outcome. A good example of this would be the series' arcs which often end in an anti-climatic manner. Basically, there are a lot of scenes and story developments that you won’t see coming because they defy conventional shonen storytelling or are unpredictable in their own right.
The series' unorthodoxy can also be seen in its fights which are primarily cerebral. In addition to being well-executed, HxH fights are smart and involve a lot of strategy. Raw power is a factor but it is not the factor that decides battle outcomes, actual power (nen abilities), experience and strategy are all taken into account. If a main character is outclassed by an opponent in all or most categories, he is likely to lose. Moreover, main characters are not given any special treatment in combat. This smart approach to fighting is further enhanced by nen, a unique and complex power system held by defined rules. The concept of nen, its principles, aura types and many applications on the battlefield reveal the huge amount of thought that was put into it. I still remember having to pause episodes, even research a bit during its introduction, just to digest it in its entirety. 
The appearance and writing of the series also create an effect of cognitive dissonance, the simplistic look of the show mentally conflicts with the brilliance and unorthodoxy of its writing. As new viewers delve deeper into HxH, they realize that there is much more to the show than its cover art and synopsis suggest. Expectations of the series being immature, simple or generic are progressively overturned as the show reveals its surprising underbelly.
Sound:
As for sound, HxH has a line of great soundtracks that started off decent but got better as the series progressed. With the exception of a few minor characters, the voice acting in this series is excellent. As a person who has never seen the old series it’s hard to believe that these aren't the original voices because they fit extremely well, especially those of Gon, Killua and Hisoka whose voice actors do a perfect job of capturing their characters. 
Art:
HxH also has great art and animation. It amazes me how a long-running series like HxH delivers consistent quality animation episode after episode, especially during the fights. The series does a great job of capturing facial expressions and everything from the lighting, shading and colors adjust perfectly depending on the mood of the scene or the tone of the arc. As one reviewer (nagaiyume) said, the bright colors of the show might need some getting used to, though it is usually fans of the old series who have this problem. Personally, I think it fits the show perfectly. It adds to the charm of the series by complementing its sense of adventure, uplifting atmosphere and unique appeal as a shonen that looks simple but is actually remarkably deep. 
Characters:
Although HxH’s primary strength lies in its writing, its characters come pretty damn close. HxH has a huge cast of characters. They have quirks, dreams, inner demons, world views and overall, really likable personalities. To top it off, most of them don’t follow generic character archetypes. Although some may initially come across as “generic”, these assumptions are gradually undermined as the series progresses. 
If there's one thing I want to emphasize in the character department it would be the series main villains. When it comes to characters, this is where the show shines the brightest. HxH villains are extremely well-written (with the exception of the Bomber who won't apply to most of what I'll say below). Not only are their characterizations independently impressive, they are also distinct from one another; no two villains are the same. This distinctness does not only apply within the series but outside of it. You won't find another Hisoka, Chrollo or Ant King in any other anime. This is what makes HxH villains so compelling, in addition to having really impressive characterizations, they are also original. Although I excluded one out of the four main villains from most of what I wrote above, all HxH villains do have one thing in common. Each villain strikes fear into audience, the series does a good job of establishing the level of danger these characters bring to the story and our protagonists. 
Negatives:
However, while HxH is a great series it isn't perfect. The series doesn't have a strong start, it takes three episodes for show to get going. I've seen a lot of people drop HxH early and it sucks because the first two episodes don't capture the series at all. Things start to get mildly interesting in the third episode, after that, the series just gets better and better. HxH also suffers from occasional BGM misuse. There are odd sound choices for some scenes. Sometimes they don’t really fit, other times they don’t fit it all. Lastly, the Chimera Ant arc also has minor issues with both Togashi and Madhouse to blame. Togashi’s fault lies in his writing during the middle of the CA arc which I think, pales in comparison to the rest of the series. HxH has made a name for itself for holding a consistent high level throughout its run; it’s a series that’s just so engaging and easy to marathon. However, I believe this consistency took a hit mid-CA arc (due to handling of the story and pacing) specifically, episodes 89-98. Don’t get me wrong though, I think there are a fair number of good episodes within that 9-episode stretch but unfortunately, they are surrounded by mediocre episodes that break the consistency of an otherwise exceptional arc. Madhouse’s fault lies in its adaption of the manga chapters comprising episodes 113 and 115, which were dragged out in order to have episode 116 handled by their best animation team. Episode 113 was actually well paced except for one atrocious sequence while episode 115 as a whole was generally poorly paced.
A clarification about the ""slowed down pacing"" of Chimera Ant arc:
If you’ve been reading up about HxH, you’ve probably seen some people complain about the “poor pacing” during the “narration heavy episodes” of the CA arc. Well if you’re wondering how much truth is there to this statement and were going to ask me about it, my answer would be it depends.
At episode 111, the palace invasion (climax of the CA arc) begins and narration begins to play a huge role in episodes in order to (1) pack a whole level of depth into the story and (2) increase dramatic tension. Rather than a high octane ""action fest"" people would expect from a shonen arc climax, the palace invasion takes a psychological heavy route wherein a character’s thoughts and mental state are given more focus than the actual action. This psychological focus together with the narration slows down the pace considerably in the sense that episodes begin to cover a lot less in narrative time. However, despite this “slowed down pace”, the pacing of these episodes remain solid with good amount of manga chapters being covered during each of these episodes and the duration of scenes being on point (except for episodes 113 and 115 which I mentioned earlier in this review).
In the end, it depends if the narration works on you or not. If you like the psychological approach and experience an increase in suspense then you’ll have no problems with the pacing and are in for one helluvah of a ride. However, if you don’t like the psychological approach and feel that the narrator’s heavy presence breaks your immersion then you’re in for a grueling experience. Of course, there are other combinations such as liking the psychological route but not feeling the immersion or maybe the narration just didn't work on you completely. Well, if this happens to be the case then you’ll end up with mixed feelings. On the bright side, most people who end up watching the invasion end up enjoying the narration. However, if you happen to be one of the good number of people who end up not liking the narration don’t worry, only episodes 111-118 of the palace invasion have heavy narration. After episode 118, the narration begins to decrease and episodes eventually reach a point where they are “back to normal”.
Heads up to people looking for action:
Although I love the fighting aspect of the series and consider it to be a strong plus, I’ll leave this out there for the sake of subjectivity. HxH does not cater to everyone. Although fights in the series are well-executed, they are also short (1-10 minutes) and happen less in comparison to other battle anime. Moreover, the focus on strategy in battles might be off putting to people who prefer fights with more brawn and less brain. If you're expecting an action heavy series like Yu Yu Hakusho then you will be disappointed. This is because HxH is a series that relies on its story to reel in viewers. Personally, I think this is how fighting in shonen should be done. Fighting should be able to entertain and also make you think. It shouldn't drag on for too long at the expense of the story without leaving you underwhelmed. 
Conclusion:
Hunter x Hunter (2011) is an intelligent battle anime with a fantastic story, excellent characters and fights that involve a lot of strategy. Separating it from most of its genre, the series subverts shonen tropes and boasts unpredictable plot progressions that make it truly unique.

                ---The review contains spoilers---
“You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that’s where you’ll find the things more important than what you want”. (Hunter Election Arc).
I don’t have words enough to describe what was this 148 episodes for me.
I'll not spend this review talking about the Synopsis, because It’s right here on MAL.
I need to tell you, why you must watch this masterpiece, and what it represents to me.
First of all I’m gonna talk about the final episode. I felt Joy, sadness, angry (Togashi hurry up with the manga! hahah), and of course, satisfaction. Satisfaction because I heard my friends (you NEED
                  to watch it), because it wasn’t time wasted, because those 148 episodes, and the nights that I spent watching, were worth, really. Hunter x Hunter is a complex anime, a peculiar story, something that, certainly, will mix up with your feelings, with your thoughts, with your conception of a Shonen. 
What do I mean? It’s not that simple. But I’ll try to clarify: Don’t think that you’re about to find predictable arcs. Don't think that the heroes gonna always beat the villains (In some parts of the story... nobody wins). Don’t think that training and good skills can ensure that you'll defeat an enemy, sometimes you'll need more than that. Behold what humans can be (and Togashi show us really well in Chimera Ant Arc). Behold what friendship can be, in all it’s complexity. You’re not gonna see in this anime that kind of Main Character that is AWESOME for no reason, no training. Togashi will make you understand the personality of the characters and their powers. Power, I mean, Nen or aura (vital energy), similar to what we see in other shonens like, Dragon Ball (Ki) or Naruto (Chakra). It's presented to us really well how the ""Nen system"" works. The explanations are long in some episodes, but simple to understand. 
Talking now about the animation: Hunter x Hunter is breathtaking . Indeed, it can be said that Madhouse did an excellent job with the remake . I was amazed with what I saw in some episodes. I confess that many of them I've watched over and over again, just to observe the details of the animation, and not only what was happening in the story ( Episode 131 I’ve watched 4 times ). In the end , I'm grateful that Madhouse animated Hunter x Hunter from the beginning .
The characters.. oh they are unique, really. It's quite impressive how Togashi gave to them a variety of personalities. You'll not gonna enjoy only the four main characters (although many consider that the main are Gon and Killua, since the story focuses more on the two of them from a certain phase). Hunter x Hunter have a significant  character development on the supporting ones too, and, of course in the villains (you'll love them, believe me).  I don't have a favorite character in this show. It's impossible to choose one. Watch it and you'll experience what I'm saying.
You mean this show has nothing bad?
Yes it has.
1) The worst thing in this show is: It ended.
Okay, joking aside, I think is the worst part is the beginning. You have to watch 4 or 5 episodes to feel in the mood to still watching. Many people just gave up in the first episodes. I can ensure you, go on and watch it til the end. 
Particularly I don’t like so much The Hunter Exam Arc, the first arc of the story. If you compare with the other arcs it’s really not the best one. I have in my heart this two arcs: Chimera Ant Arc and Yorknew city Arc.
The second thing many fans of the show complains a LOT, is the Opening song. Why? 148 episodes, different openings, but... THE SAME SONG. For me it wasn't a problem at all. I love the song, and... I think I watched the opening “one hundred and forty-eight” times and I sang it. Hahaha. But I really wanted to see a new song too.
The third thing is totally my personal opinion: the narrator. Your first contact with him will be in the begining of the early episodes. He will explain what is a Hunter.
The narration it's something that we don't see a lot in other animes. I like it, it's brilliant and I totally understand that this add gives the anime the suspense and it's particular style. 
The advantage of having a narrator, in my opinion, is the ''observer factor''. Instead of exploring the point of view of all the characters, we have that peculiar element that seems to know everything and adds important information to the audience. 
But, eventually, the narrator annoys me, specially in the Chimera ant Arc. I mean: we see what's going on, it's not necessary an explanation! 
Of course that the ''narration effect'' will depend on the way you receive it. Sometimes will give that ""slow motion"" you'll need to absorb what's going on, but in a few episodes it's really overused. 
In conclusion, I have to thank above all, you Togashi Yoshihiro. You're brilliant. You can make unique characters, outstanding plots. You still go on, and on,  in successive hiatus in the manga, and everyone complains a lot (even me), but then what you show to us is so amazing that makes it worth waiting. Thank you for exist and for this awesome masterpiece.
For you that didn't watch it yet, do not be fooled by the first few episodes or with the synopsis. Both of them will give you the impression that you're about to see a generic shounen. Insist. This is a kind of anime that in each episode everything seems to evolve: the story, the setting, the characters. You will be hooked, unable to stop watching .
And then my friend, you will start to feel pain. Yes, pain, when you realize that you're at the 100º episode and there is only 48 episodes left.
Embrace this adventure called Hunter x Hunter! xD",10
"
                At first, when I read the synopsis of hunter x hunter (2011) (for the rest of this review will be called hxh as abbreviation) I could not quite deduce the rationality of this show being scored and reviewed with such praise as it receives on a daily basis. I am sure many of you ,who are planning to pick up this show sometime soon, are thinking the same as I did before watching this show and I will do my best to change any contravening opinions towards this series.
Story: 9
As you all have likely read the synopsis of hxh, it certainly stands out from most
                  other shounen ever made. There is a kid that decides to go on an adventure, for a particular purpose, meets friends, becomes stronger and eventually defeats powerful opponents. It doesn't come off as a very complex or intriguing story/plot, nor is there a generic/forgettable cast and an amassed other facts that would remind you of how forgettable this show probably is. Believe me it's not.
Beyond the first few episodes which this generalised speculation derives from, you will see that hxh differs from most shounen in terms of intelligence (strategic battles, clever arcs and plot) and the pacing of the whole show throughout each arc is outstanding. The absence of fillers throughout the 148 episodes ( excluding recaps) makes this show that much less frustrating to watch.
You may have heard an arc in particular, that the MAL community keeps on raving about: the Chimera Ant arc. Without throwing any spoilers in this review, the hype is worth it. This arc is, by most fans of the franchise, seen as a masterstoke and with good reason. The previous arcs create a substantial build-up to the C.A arc which makes the emphasis and usefulness of the arc that much more prominent.
However, the only factor that prevented my rating of a 9 to a 10, was the slow start and the half-open ending; while it not bad and was a good conclusion to the show, left the viewer rather unsettled with the whole experience.
Characters: 10
Where hxh really shines is in the shows' magnificent cast. As stated in my introduction, typically, most shounen do not have the best cast of characters that anime has brought out to the community, and more often than not defeat their enemies using the all-mighty force that is  'the power of friendship(!)' which brings sweet victory and joy to the protagonists of the show. Forget this ever existed in anime when watching hxh, as the sincere friendship that is witnessed between the main cast is nothing short of magnificent. It is realistic and evolves over a long period of time.
What makes the characters of hxh further at a stand-point, is that the antagonists are (for the most part) just as likable as the protagonists. Every character is very well developed ( every = any character that mattered to the story) and therefore does not make you want to spurt out the words "" Wow, this character sucks "" , with the exception of the bomber which, when watching the series, you will notice that had no real purpose for doing things to the extent that he did.
Finally, I will talk about my three favorite characters of the series:
1. Gon
I love Gon. At first he seems like your everyday generic protagonist that has no potential to evolve as a person. He comes across as useless and annoying.Then along the way something happens to him; something that is rarely in a protagonist like him. This is called ' Character Development '. The development that Gon receives throughout the series is fantastic and will make you love him until the end. He truly is desperate to find his father and the audience can see how he never throws in the towel.
2. Killua
There's something really likable about white-haired guys in anime and Killua does not fall short in this aspect. He has a broad and complex backstory, and again, like Gon, significant development, which is seen to play a phenomenal role to how realistic the friendship between Gon and Killua is. His background as an assassin and his scarring childhood coupled with his raw talent and one-of-a-kind personality makes him a lovable and three-dimensional character.
3. Meruem
Without spoiling much, Meruem is truly an unbelievable antagonist. At first you envision he is ruthless for no purpose, and comes off as a cliche and rather irritating being. With the meeting of another character you see how he evolves and how his facade in his personality makes him one of the best,if not the greatest character in the series.
Art and Animation: 9
When watching an anime that has a plethora of episodes such as hxh, one would expect a decline and rise in animation from time to time. However, Madhouse did a terrific job at keeping the animation and art as consistent and fluid as possible. The amount of money that was spent purely on budget really surprised me and the animation only gets better as the series progresses. When entering the C.A arc, you will see that Madhouse used their best animators to produce stunning images intertwined 
with outlines, shadows and fluency that serves as 'eye-candy' when watching the series. Battle sequences are as well a proof of how much effort is poured into this show, as the studio does not tend to cut corners, e.g using the same background over and over again.
The opening and endings' animation improves significantly st time progresses, which blows my mind when comparing the differences in appearance. That is to say, the animation was brilliant at the start of the anime as well.
Sound: 9
The opening: 'Departure'  is used throughout the entire anime although it switches between two different versions of the song, as well as changing the animation sequence each time, and this amazes me as every opening suits the anime perfectly! I did not skip the opening even once when watching the series; instead I stared smiling and singing along to the music.
The endings are all fantastic in my opinion, and I love all the songs that are presented to the audience at the end of each episode. The order for me goes 
1>4>2>3>5=6  (5 & 6 are different sections of the same song) but I love them all nevertheless.
The ost of the anime is one of the best I have heard in any anime. My personal favorite is ' A kingdom of Predators'. It consists of a great variety of orchestra (mostly in the C.A arc) and lots of violin and piano that can be heard as well. However, sometimes the ost is not played at the most appropriate moments which prevents a score of 10 being given.
Monumental credibility must be given to the voice actors, and for Gon in particular, which is seen especially at episode 116, the mere brilliance that is spurted as 'emotions though words' is extraordinary. The only complaint that I sometimes hear arriving from people is that the narration in the C.A arc ( for around 10 episodes) is irritating and overwhelms the episodes, making them seem extremely slow-paced. I tend to  disagree with this argument , as the pacing seems to only benefit by the narration of those episodes, as it was a crucial moment in the series where narration was essential. I hope you won't find this narration an issue, since I certainly didn't.
Enjoyment: 9
Wow what a joyful ride this was. It keeps you hooked from early on and urges you to watch the next episode after experiencing the wonderful ending of each arc. The enjoyment factor, of course, originated from the entirety of the show. If any of the above were to be done poorly, the show would not come out to be nearly as enjoyable as it was. I not once felt bored during this series, and I believe that the pacing is fabulous. There's not a single moment that leaves the viewer wanting to skip ahead or fast-forward. As a result, I am almost certain that you will watch this show, engulfed by the brilliance of this anime.
Overall: 9
Believe me when i tell you this: this show is a near masterpiece; as close of a masterpiece as a show of this genre gets. Don't be fooled while watching this anime, and drop it due to its slow start, as you may miss out on a truly miraculous experience.
Thank you for reading my review of Hunter x Hunter (2011). Have a great day. RedInfinity out.",9

                ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***
HxH is one of the many overrated shounen anime out there and I can summarize my review with one sentence: „If you became kinda interested in HxH, because you have heard it’s so much more than just a shounen, don’t believe it, because it is exactly that, just another shounen."" Now I’m not a fan of shounen, and if you read this review you will find out why, so this anime is not made for me, but just for more diversity in views I will analyze this anime a bit closer.
HxH is one of those anime where you can literally see the
                  quality dropping, with the earlier episodes being made nicely and at the end it has one of the longest pacings I have ever seen. Since the artstlye isn’t in any form detailed and costly they can’t tell me they ran out of money. I assume they just wanted to milk the cashcow to the end and stretch manga material of 20 episodes(in relation to the beginning) to around 60.
Like I said before the start of the show was quite nice. It had a few things which didn’t really make any sense, especially the riddles, but it had a nice build up and a good pacing. It seemed to me as if the start also really wanted to surprise the viewers with something unexpected, regardless of how illogical it was. It also didn’t do much good in terms of atmosphere, in some cases it even destroys the atmosphere it built up just for surprise reasons. The main characters are also unexplained overpowered, sure there are a few stronger but that alone doesn’t justify a little kid being physically stronger than a well-trained grown up man, just because he “grew up in the woods”, which is btw contradicted later on. But besides a few negative things to say, the start (first 17-20 episodes maybe) was ok. It had a goal and set motivation from the character side, the main story kinda made sense (more than the rest of the show) and they had some kind of, what the fans claim as “tactics in fighting”.
In the second arc the terror already begins. Motivations from the character were completely forgotten and not even mentioned in order to have a little conflict for the goal of this arc. The reason for the first arc and what they have achieved was completely pointless and even contradictory as explained in the later arcs. The following arcs shine with, not knowing what to call somethings. For the show an assassin is someone who is physically strong and can endure much pain instead of being stealthy and deadly, the so called “mafia” is a bunch of unorganized idiots who apparently have a lot of power (they at least have a lot of money) which is contradictory in every way and let me question the whole world building of this anime and we still don't know what a Hunter is and does. The writers have no idea of how money works, which wouldn’t be a problem if they hadn’t dedicated a whole arc just for money getting purposes, which later on is also completely useless. Not to forget the story is full of convenience, which goes beyond the acceptable amount.  Some of the arcs are complete filler since they either are pointless or have nothing to do with the final goal (the motivation of the main protagonist). There is even one arc were the main protagonist is inside a video game and literally the first thing he hears there is that being here is completely pointless, but he doesn’t care and goes on anyway, which makes the whole arc pointless and questions the existence of the build up to it. 
This show becomes less endurable from arc to arc, with the mafia arc being an exception but still not good. It’s like comparing a pile of shit with a pile of shit which has a cherry on top of it. Seeing the later arcs lets you remember the earlier ones as if they were in any way good, that’s how horrible this show gets. 
HunterxHunter also likes to copy or inlcude everything that was or is popular it seems. That goes from character design (Robocop) even to whole story arcs (the video card game arc which included cardgames like magic the gathering).
A thing that really bothers me as well is the fact that this show has no scale what so ever. The abilities and the strength of every character are so completely random and out of order. It even shifts during the whole anime, making character who should be strong considering their rank utterly weak and character who should be weak unnecessary strong. Its like as if one writer wrote the hierarchy of all the characters and their relationship and then another decided, because how much he liked their appearance how strong they are. 
All of the above was pretty much the first half of the show. The show was like I said very bad but had at least some arcs which were watchable and had a decent pacing. From episode 80 onwards the chimera arc takes place. This is basically the main difference between the original version of the HunterxHunter anime and the 2011 version. 
The chimera arc is the worst thing I have seen in a long time in terms of writing. You can’t take anything they say and do seriously, since the character design is so freaking retarded. They say they are ants but then a penguin and a pink panda in a suit is sitting there with them. NONE of the so called Ant-villains looks even remotely like an ant. The writers wanted to make this arc dark and mature but only showed how childish their writing is. Wow, characters are dying more often now, but that’s about it with all the change they made. As if character dying = mature and dark. This is the most naïve way of seeing it, but it fits a shounen. 
In this arc HxH really shows how little time they spend with thinking through the whole thing. Where villains came from and what their motivation is was never a thing HunterXHunter spends any time in but in this case it makes absolutely no sense that some ant-people who just came into existence are able to be as strong as one of the strongest person in the whole anime. So again.. no scale existend. And with no time spend with motivation and personification the writers now believe they can put drama in the show when the villains die. Are you freaking kidding me? Yeah the ants just killed hundreds if not thousands of people and now I should feel sorry for them? The drama in this whole anime is the worst sort of melodrama, forced and reliable so much on double standarts. 
In the last arc the tactics really shine, in terms of sucking. In the last 50 episodes there is only one fight anyways, so there is not much to talk about, but the tactics there is so utterly idiotic. There is so much bullshit that happened during this arc, there was not 1 episode where I wasn’t facepalming. 
But all of the above would have been minor points if it wasn’t for how boring this whole arc was. The reason I criticize their “tactics” is only because they spend so much time with talking and every fan thinks the tactics are so great. 90% of the time they talk about irrelevant stuff and when it comes to real tactics they are utterly bullshit, convenient or deus ex machina.
Characters of this show are not in any terms special. Have you seen either Naruto, One Piece, Bleach you know the personality of the main character. Add a bunch of extra typical side characters and you got them all. It’s just the typical teenager character who is strong enough to change the world stuff.  In HunterXHunter they at least  didnt go full overpowered with the main character, but considering the age of the protagonist and the enemies he  is fighting later on I would say its pretty unrealistic. He is a very wish-fulfilling character and not that much of a role model. I think there is nothing really wrong with this wish-fulfilling kind of anime, but they are really nothing for people older than their demographic (in mind of course).  So saying this is more than a shounen is really wrong. 
Music is also pretty bad. All the good songs were copies of famous classical songs, such as Lacrimosa from Mozart’s Requiem, the rest is rather forgettable boring background music. Artstyle is simple and character design in the WHOLE show is the worst I have ever seen, but that’s ofc only my opinion. I found it to be nice to see no cgi, if I remember correctly. 
So overall: This show is not more than a shounen and I might add the worst written shonen I have ever seen, but I am not into that genre so I only saw a few of them. If you are a person who likes more mature stuff and think there is something behind this anime, otherwise it wouldn’t be so popular, don’t fall for the trap and stay away from it. At the end you will just regret it.",1

                After reading the many overwhelmingly positive reviews about this show, I've decided to write a more realistic, honest and unbiased opinion-driven review about this show.
Many people have said how amazing this show is, and that it's incredibly unique and special. Did I? Well yes......and no.
I am probably one of the very few people that didn't consider this series a masterpiece
Story: 
Hunters are people who hunt. Whether it is criminals, treasures, rare creatures or even food, they will hunt it.
We have the story of Gon, a young boy living on Whale island, aspiring to become a hunter like his father, Ging, a legendary hunter who abondoned
                  him while he was born to chase his dream. Gon also wants to meet his father and find out why he abondoned him while he was a baby.
To become a hunter, he must pass the dastardly difficult hunter exams, which has an extremely low success rate. Along to way to the exams, he meets a few friends, rivals and a creepy paedo clown, hence beginning the first arc. After that, the concept of nen is introduced, which is basically the life force and magical power source of the series. The concept of nen is actually pretty cool, and it's more complicated to use than some other powers like alchemy and chakra, and it's creativity is often shined upon in fights. However, creativity can destory things aswell, and sometimes nen can be used as an over complicated ability with too much time used to explain different powers.
After the exams, there are arcs all varying in tones and stories and this is where problems arise. Some are dark, and some are light. Some arcs are excellent and others are well......terrible dog shit.
None of the arcs are linked well together and are very disjointed and inconsistent. 
Instead of focusing on an overall story, the arcs feel like a bunch of mini-stories building up to a main one, and they focus way too much on the individual arcs instead of an overall story, making it seem like a huge mess. One day, you've got a crime thriller, another one a video game, and then a bug apocalypse. One of the most critcally acclaimed arcs in the series, to me felt like a 60 episode filler, and that experience was not enjoyable at all. It baffles me on how people say it is a masterpiece, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The pacing in this arc was unbelievably bad, as was the horrible story and enemy designs (not the main villains though...they were badass).
The best arc by far is the yorkshin city arc, which doesn't come until episode 40- something.
What's more disappointing is that the story of hunter x hunter had huge potential to look into the life of a hunter, but the hunter aspect of the show is not explored much. The final aspect that irked me about the story was over-using narration to the point of unbearable commenting into the smallest of details of the story complicating itself tenfold.
Now, what was good about the story? A decent amount, actually. In the earlier arcs of the series it felt a lot different from other shonen and the individual arc storytelling was actually working very well, as each arc had a purpose to the overall story. Each arc was well written, well paced and had it's fair share of enjoyable and memorable moments. Also the annoying narrator had much less to say. These earlier arcs were much more interesting and intriguing and didn't bore me the way the later arcs did. Really, the quality of the series started degrading by the end of the yorknew city arc.
The early arcs didn't feel like fillers and contributed something, whereas the later arcs were just random and only inflicted minor things to the story, but did more to the development of the characters, which is not a bad thing, but dragging it out for 60 episodes is a crime in it's own right. Overall the story in hunter hunter varied from being amazing to a total dump. However ""the total dump"" is considered great by everyone, so you should check up the chimera ant arc anyway, you'll probably like it. What the entire story did well were the fights. All of them had wits and brains and didn't take an entire episode just to charge up an attack or talk for hours before the fight. (*cough* Dbz and naruto.)
However, when nen (the series' fighting system) kicks in the story downgrades hugely.
Instead of focusing on the story, we need to sit through pointless training regiments and stupid explanations of the usage of nen. Not to say i hate the series' fighting system, but in my opinion, it is far too complex and uninteresting and it sacrifices decent storytelling and replaces it with boredom. (Yes, it can be boring- if you've got a short attention span don't bother watching the later arcs)
And last thing I want to note is that the chimera ant arc's story was just horrible and boring- mostly due to its snail pacing.
There were many plot holes (why would the hunter association send two under experienced twelve year olds to get rid of the ants? Why didn't netero just bomb the nest to begin with?)
and unnecessary plot points (the whole episode with gyro for example).
But above all, it was boring, and I fell asleep watching it.
Anyway story: 6/10
Art:
Fluid, colourful and bright, the animation is done very well. The large scale battles were animated gorgeously , and they are a joy to watch.
Charcater design wise is a mixed bag. Most of the characters are designed very well, in contrast to the godawful drawings from the manga. However, the chimera ants' design are absolutely horrendous. I know they are chimeras but while I was watching I thought to myself ""Wft is this?!""
The design for the chimera ants isn't the animation studio's fault though. The source material is to blame.
9/10
Sound:
The ost is very good, but they do tend to re use the same tracks often so there can be a lack of variety. They also tend to forget earlier songs later in the series.
Voice acting wise, it's done superbly. All the voice actors blend and personalise their characters excellently and they display a lot of emotion and effort as they voice act their roles.
9/10
Characters:
Now this category is a bit difficult to review and I'll explain why later.
The main cast consists of Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio, but I'll focus mainly on Gon and Killua. There are other characters, ususally most important on seperate arcs and i will talk a little about them.
Gon is a 12 year old kid who is, in my opinion, an improved and more realistic version of kid Goku from the original dragon ball, except for the fact that he's not insanely over-powered.
This makes it a good and bad thing. Good is that he's not only a more unique take on your usual happy go lucky young male protagonist, but that he's got layers of emotion to his character and has a rock-lee type moral to keep on getting stronger and improve yourself. Gon is steroeotypical and non stereotypical at the same time, and he's a badass little kid who strives on becoming stronger. The negative is that....he's still got a lot of the same thing. Gon can have a rather predictable personality. One minute he's a clueless little kid for comic relief and the other, he's crying when someone dies. He also doesn't get much development until much later in the show.
All in all he's a decent take on your normal protagonist.
Killua is the white-haired, slanted-eyed guy that's everyone's favourite and rightfully so. He's got a similar, but ultimately different ego compared to his best friend Gon's and he's got layers to his likable personailty and ferocious alter-ego as a darkness-fueled assassin. He's a cool laid back guy that has some serious skill and family relationships. He can seem pretty harmless at first, but piss him off and he'll tear you to shreads. Killua is the one that powers the dynamic and entertaining relationship between him and Gon, and he's a fan favourite character that definitely deserves it.
Now what about the other main characters? THERE ARE NONE. That's right, don't be fooled by the artwork of the anime with gon,killua and the two others (Kurapika the blond cross-dresser and that tall dude with the glasses and suitcase who is Leorio). The other two guys only make appearances in the first arc and the Yorkshin, and then they are forgotten and become irrelevant which is a huge shame and it offends them as characters.
Basically, there's Gon and Killua and then everyone else. Gon and Killua are the only characters prominent throughout the series.
Well, Kurapika and Leorio could be called ""important"" side characters so I'll talk a bit about them.
Kurapika is a blond-haired badass who is driven by revenge and everything that Sasuke Uchiha should have been. Because a certain organisation wiped out his clan, he desires to hunt that group down and get his revenge. He's also a complex character with layers to him and he's got one of the coolest powers in the show.
however, he only appears in about 40 episodes, which really sucks. We don't know what happens to him when the series ends either.
Leorio is used as a comic relief guy early in the show and portrayed as a bad tempered, money obsessed businessman but he becomes more likable as the series goes on and develops his character with the little screen time he has. Long story short, he is a pretty entertaining and funny character that's certainly not useless.
The side characters and villains are great in their own right but it still irks me that they don't have much screen time until a certain arc, which is a shame.
Killua's family, the Zoldycks are a group of professional Asassins and most of them have a great and powerful presence and each have a set of their own unique personalities. It's a shame that they don't have much screentime.
Netero, the chairman or, boss of the hunter organisation is a pretty complex guy too- you don't know if he's serious or not, you can't just read him like an open book. He's like master roshi or jiraiya with added insanity.
Bisky is a mentor to Gon and Killua and she's a bit of a tsundere with a fearsome alter-ego.
The characters in the chimera ant arc were truly horrible however. 
None of the new hunters in that arc were memorable or likable imho. Moving on.
What makes the series truly shine, however, are the villains. Whether it is a perverted clown, an evil brother, an insanely buffed steroid- addicted wild man, a calm, but truly evil mastermind or a bunch of powerful chimeras, all are interesting and wild in their own way.
7/10 (for the lack of screentime for certain characters)
Enjoyment: it kinda depends. Some episodes have you on the edge of your seat and some may bore you with more dialogue. However, sometimes I did not enjoy the show simply because it tried too hard to over complicate things and over using narration. Other episodes could be amazing, however.
Some episodes were foreshadowing and building up to later events, and they  range in quality too.
Edit 16/07/15 
I am not saying that hunter x hunter is a bad anime- I'm just saying it's not for me. I thought the first third of it was really good and well written but after the yorknew city arc I just felt it became boring and that it wasn't the same as before.
I know im going to get plenty of hate for bashing the chimera ant arc, but remember it's just my opinion.
But whatever, you can just be a fanboy and laugh at me for giving naruto and fairy tail higher ratings than the ""masterpiece"" that is hunter x hunter.
6/10
Verdict:
A good show, but it gets some praise that it doesn't deserve- it's pretty damn overrated.
It is a pretty well written (for the most part) show with good themes and morals, with good fights and characters. Yes, it can get dreary and over-complicated at times but you can get over it from the entertaining characters and fights.
A major downside was.....the series didn't connect with me.  The story and characters, and the world (which is very extravagant and unique) wasn't very relatable and the entire series is nothing but fighting.
Hell, the characters aren't even relatable if I'm being honest. We don't get to see them being real people if you ask me, we only see them fighting.
If gon and killua and the rest were more fleshed out, the series would definitely be better. They are usually in situations where they have to fight people, it wouldve been nice to see them interacting in normal situations.
Another problem for me was the lack of comic relief in the later arcs, and also in the chimera ant arc the show tried WAAAY too hard to be dark and edgy, it didnt feel natural.
Basically what i'm saying is everything I didn't like about the series was in the chimera ant arc.
 If you want a series focused on battles, this may be the one for you.
However, the biggest flaw was the ending.
I know it wasn't the studio's fault but my god it is anti-climactic.
What happened to the zoldycks? Leorio? Kurapika? Gon? Gon's adopted mum? The phantom troupe?
We shall never know.
Hunter x hunter is not a masterpiece, or a special shounen which everyone claims it is, but there are a few things that make it special and differenciate it from other battle anime. Now you may think what i said about the negatives of the show are all bs, but remember, it's my honest opinion.
If I only rated the first 58 episodes of the series I'd gladly give it 8 or 9 out of 10. However, since i need to take all of the arcs into account, my final score is 6/10.
Overall: 6/10 (fair)

                Heed my warning and heed it well: If you so choose to watch the gracious series that is Hunter x Hunter (2011), watch it well past the first few episodes. Though the first few episodes make the entire series as a whole seem bland, if you think this way, you're wrong and you should feel bad. Really really bad. Think of it this way: the series is a marathon runner. A good runner prepares himself and warms up for the long arduous journey ahead (ie. HxH). The bad runner carelessly takes off from the start with no preparation and eventually dying down halfway through because
                  of poor preparation (ie. SAO, although the first half was somewhat enjoyable, the second half obviously sucked). HxH takes a while to be set in motion, but its part of winning the marathon. Preparation is essential. Listen, give yourself the first 25 episodes, and you'll see that it actually IS good and well worth your time -- and it gets much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much better. Much better. In fact, I created an account with the sole purpose to explain why Hunter x Hunter is a must-watch.
Now, I shall ACTUALLY explain....
Story (10/10): Gon Freecss is a 12 year old boy, and an aspiring hunter with a taste for adventure. Sound familiar, eh? His father, Ging, left the newborn Gon, without leaving many clues to where the father had ventured to. Sound even more familiar, eh? Well don't assume that this is like any other cliched storyline, because it's far from it. Throughout his journey, he gains the acquaintance of Leorio (an aspiring doctor), Kurapika (a special-eyed boy enveloped in a deep vengeance for the killers of his tribe), and soon enough Gon's closest friend, Killua (a member of the highest skilled assassin-family, showing the most potential). Throughout the group's journey, each of the character's story play an essential role in driving the plot forward, and oh how the plot thickens.
The story is constantly evolving and constantly moving, sparing no slack in pace. If you hate filler, you will love this show especially. It will constantly keep you hooked. If you've just started the series, keep watching I tell you, keep watching. It keeps getting better.
Art (10/10): Now I'm no art aficionado, but I can tell when too bright is too bright and too dark is too dark. All I can is that it's well balance and is pleasing to the eye. Now it's not seizure-inducing like NGNL, but it get's the job done in an enjoyable manner. The palette, uh, looks nice, and uh, stuff. Yeah. There's no ""you're trying too hard"" to be expected in the artistic representation of Hunter x Hunter. Edit: and once you get to the end of the Chimera Ant arc, I give you my solemn word: you will not be disappointed with the conglomeration of art and sound and the overall feeling. No spoilers.
*Sound (10/10): Now this is my FAVORITE part. Part of what makes a series whole is the great sounds that go on behind it. I absolutely adore the music that went on behind the story. It did what I find other series have a hard time perfecting. When intrigue is being produced, music that correctly suits the situation will be presented, and in turn your intrigue will be piqued. When you're on the edge of your seat biting your nails, music adds to that experience. I believe it sets a tone for the story, and does it in an extremely efficient way. However, the only fault is that the music does not fit perfectly sometimes, but it isn't enough to irritate someone. It still gets the job done, and helps steep one's mind into the story further. And possible the BEST part of the sound portion of HxH is the inclusion of Gustav Holst's ""Jupiter"" from ""The Planets."" It's a beautiful song and it's inclusion in the series legit made me shed a tear m8.
Characters (10/10): No stone is left unturned in the realm of character development. Every character has a specific motive driving them and the drive to accomplish it. There's an explanation for every character's purpose -- and then it develops farther and farther. Think of Gon, the main character, as the main line. As Gon progresses, new characters come into contact with him, creating an infrastructure of development, moving forward at the same pace as Gon. The development only expands around Gon at the same time as Gon ventures about.
Enjoyment (10/10): Need I explain my enjoyment further? The rating clearly declares my sentiment towards the series. The only thing that I DON'T enjoy is that the series is ending at only 148 episodes. That's right, only. By the time you go through the 145 episodes I've gone through, you'll feel how I feel to realize that there's only 148. 148 does not do this series justice. All I, as well as I'm sure anyone else who has ventured through the series thus far feels is that there should be more. and more. and more. and more. There's much more to be explored! Given, there are only 350 chapters (at the moment) of the manga, and the anime finishes quite close. My only hope, and I'm sure I speak for many others, is that the series picks up maybe even a year or 2 later, when there is more of the manga for the anime to run off of -- and not take 10 years to reboot and recontinue. All I can say is we want more, and more is an understatement.
TL;DR - Watch Hunter x Hunter (2011) past the first season, instantaneously become addicted, and see why this underrated series should be not underrated nor overrated, but rated with high regard. You will not be disappointed. Just watch it. 10/10.
PS. People who give this show less than a 9 eat children.",10

                After years of everyone from personal friends to random internet commentators imploring me to watch Madhouse’s 2011 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter, I finally got around to it. I was told that this was the best long-form battle shounen out there, avoiding all the sins of mediocrity other Shonen Jump titles like Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach commit. I was told Hunter x Hunter did not constantly try to implausibly escalate the stakes of each battle, didn’t rely on boring cliché motivations of characters just wanting to get stronger for no reason, did not draw out its battle sequences for outrageous lengths of time, did
                  not include random unnecessary filler. When I looked more into it I saw that its animation was far superior to anything I’d seen of a similar length and that it was in the all-time top 5 on MAL. I came into it with somewhat high expectations. I was not expecting a masterpiece, but at least a competently written and directed series that would outpace the mediocrity I’ve come to expect of this genre.
It turns out, I must not be in on some elaborate inside joke or meme. After sitting through 148 episodes of this I do not see how anybody over the age of twelve could impartially think this series is anything special. The bottom line is this is one of the most completely incoherent, unevenly paced, poorly thought out, and generic series I’ve ever seen.
I suppose I’ll start with my positive notes about the series. First, the animation is noticeably better than just about any series of this length. It got a little slipshod for moments around episodes 100-120 with ill-fitting CGI thrown in now and then, but started and ended strong and was never unnervingly bad. My biggest complaint about the artstyle, which has way more to do with the source material than Madhouse’s animation quality, is that the character designs are not coherent with each other. With a few exceptions (eg., Hisoka, Biscuit, and Palm) they look fine, but it looks like they were all ripped out of completely different series. However, I suppose that’s a sign of things to come as the plot is also an incoherent mess that feels like several different series randomly crammed together. Another positive note is that the soundtrack is actually rather exceptional, almost ill-fittingly so considering how weak the series itself is. However, various tracks were over-used and ran somewhat hollow towards the end. Overall, the soundtrack might have been the best point of the series. The voice acting is mostly adequate, with Mariya Ise’s performance of Killua really standing out. I would recommend avoiding the English dub for the most part (I watched about half of the series dubbed) as some side characters have really shoddy and obnoxious actors.
There are also redeeming aspects of character development and plot progression. For the most part, all that stuff I was told about it avoiding the sins most other shounen commit was true for the first sixty or so episodes. The first few “fight” scenes actually felt like refreshing deconstructions of what is so annoying about most shounen fight sequences. For an example, a character would start up some annoying cliched banter about how powerful he was and how he couldn’t be beaten like most scenes from Naruto only to be shut up by a punch in the face. It felt refreshingly well-paced in the first three or so arcs, the main cast of characters were rather endearing, and there was little in the way of boring filler.
However, even in the early episodes, it never felt like anything special. I was enjoying it well enough and could see why some people really liked it, but it was somewhat generic and far from a masterpiece. The first arc was a fairly typical exam-style arc, very similar, for example, to the chunin exams in Naruto. It revolves around our main character Gon trying to get a Hunter license through an extremely difficult exam involving a wide variety of off-the-wall, unrelated tasks. The main point of this arc was to acquaint viewers with the main cast of characters and introduce the notion of what a “hunter” is. 
There’s Gon, a rather endearingly naïve and ambitious 12-year-old trying to earn a Hunter’s license so he can meet his father who abandoned him as a child; a clichéd lead for a shounen, but adequate. Kurapika, a somewhat ill-tempered but driven character bent on getting revenge for the murder of his people. Leorio, a stock comedic relief character with a somewhat compelling backstory hinted at early on but never explored. Easily the best character of the series is Killua, a 12-year-old former assassin who becomes best friends with Gon early on who is trying to escape his family’s will to turn him into an assassin. Killua and Gon’s friendship (that, at times, arguably verges into canon romance, at least from Killua’s perspective) is really the highlight of the series. Killua’s dark and brooding demeanor, as well as his high skill-level, acts as a perfect counterbalance to the charming but comedically stupid naivety and innocence of Gon. The way Killua is constantly trying to prove to himself that he’s good enough for Gon was the only consistently good character dynamic that kept me watching through this series’ most painful moments. The last notable and memorable character from this early sequence is Hisoka, a wildly underdeveloped possibly pedophilic clown who seems only motivated to someday fight Gon because he wants a challenge (we’re already getting into boring shonen clichés) and acts as the series' only consistent antagonist, even when he helps the main protagonist. But at least he’s somewhat entertaining with how off-the-wall he is.
Towards the end of this arc, though, you realize that it accomplishes almost nothing in the way of interesting world-building. You realize about fifteen episodes in, with some dismay, that “Hunter” is just a term for a generic action-hero mercenary. It mostly turns out this exam is little more than a disconnected variety game show. But, hey, at least the characters are somewhat compelling, if a little bland, and the games are somewhat interesting. At this point, I was still optimistic and thought  if they flesh out these main characters other than Killua a bit more this could get good.
As you get into the second arc, the series begins to go a little stale and it becomes really clear just how lazy and bland the supposed worldbuilding for this fictional setting is. After a few episodes of rallying Killua back from his family, which served for some interesting character building, the main four characters split up. Killua and Gon participate in another shonen cliché of a battle tournament to get money, as well as pawning some antiques on the side, to obtain a video game that somehow has some hint as to how to find Gon’s dad. The main point of this section is to engage in some worldbuilding around the use of aura and nen—the main fighting mechanic of this series. It renders the first arc mostly useless since it turns out obtaining the Hunters license didn’t mean anything, meaning the notion there is not any unnecessary filler here was a lie. The fighting mechanics are overexplained at times and is a rather typical plot device for a shonen, but it gets the job done. This is one of the more boring and forgettable sections of the series, and that is saying something considering the tedium to come. 
More interestingly, Kurapika begins to try to enact his revenge plot against a gang called the Phantom Spiders and we get some interesting development of his character. Eventually, the two subplots of Gon and Killua training and Kurapika getting revenge dovetail as they try to stop the antagonists from robbing. The video game angle is forgotten for about twenty episodes, just one of many times a key plot point will be randomly dropped. Oh, and now Leorio is mostly forgotten, a sign of stupidity to come as he and Kurapika—two of the only compelling main characters—are about to be completely forgotten for nearly 80 episodes.
When Gon and Killua finally obtain their video game, the “Greed Island” arc starts. Here, it becomes clear that this is far from what I was promised. Greed Island is easily the worst arc I’ve ever seen in any shounen anime. The basic premise of this is basically the bastard child of Yu-Gi-Oh and Sword Art Online but somehow manages to be worse than both. Almost everything that happened in the first few arcs is completely forgotten, Gon again gets completely distracted from the goal of finding his father and gets sidetracked with the game and another random unnecessary training sequence. Killua acts completely out of character throughout this arc and is almost as naïve as Gon suddenly. Almost every other character from earlier in the series is entirely absent, and an entirely new cast of characters is introduced as well as an overexplained, convoluted new plot device of a stupid card game. The phantom troop from Kurapika’s arc shows up for a minute for no good reason and is then promptly forgotten and Hisoka plays a big role but acts way out of his previously established character.
The early part of this arc is a bunch of boring exposition spoon-fed to the viewer through badly written explanatory dialogue that needed to be done because the arc had nothing to do with anything before it. This really points to the problem of having such a completely incoherent, unrelated set of arcs: the viewers’ time is wasted with a bunch more exposition when nobody really wants tedious explanation 60+ episodes into the series. It is really reminiscent of how dreary the filler arc at the end of the original Naruto was. But at least those filler serials made some sense, most of the time, this arc was as convoluted and nonsensical as it was dull. The worst thing is during one of the most outrageously stupid moments in the history of shonen, a battle revolving around (of all things) dodgeball, all the worst clichés of mediocre shonen I was told Hunter x Hunter avoided were on full, proud display. The basic rules of dodgeball are boringly overexplained through narration eight times, the fight scene drags on for far too long, an emotionally-driven power-up by Gon is what ultimately won it, and the antagonist for the fight was built up using boring tropes (such as defeating other characters previous built-up as strong instantly to build up a new character's perceived powerfulness). The main antagonists for the arc were completely boring, unpredictable, and underdeveloped. I barely made it through this arc and almost dropped the series altogether, but was told the next arc was better.
Like the theme song I was now growing weary of told me, “there definitely is a good reason to persevere,” so persevere I did. Turns out, just like my friends did when they told me this was the best shonen ever, that was mostly a lie. The Chimera Ant arc—which takes up about 40% of the series—was better from the start, but wound up being so horribly executed that it was really frustrating to watch. Killua’s character got some important development with his relationship to Gon. A new rival for Gon’s attention acted as a good foil to Killua. A little bit of somewhat interesting world building is accomplished, but I was now really noticing how horridly lazy the worldbuilding was. Apparently, the world map is just a flipped version of a real-world mercatus projection. But, hey, it’s something. 
Again, this arc has almost nothing to do with anything that came before it, an entirely new cast of characters are introduced, and we’re exposed to even more exposition. But at least the exposition is somewhat enjoyable this time around. The premise of this arc is that a bunch of humanoid ants are killing everyone in one country to try to give birth to a new king, and Gon and Killua join some old friends of Gon’s father to stop it. The antagonists this time around are by far the most interesting and dynamic of the whole series and provide interesting external commentary on human societies. The premise is interesting, it was paced slower but felt well-executed, it was thematically interesting. Around episode 95 I was thinking this series might redeem itself.
Then, the main battle sequence starts and the so-far passable Chimera Ant arc completely jumps the shark. A whole bunch of characters we only got vague backstories on twenty to thirty episodes earlier are suddenly super important so it's hard to keep track of what’s going on. The battle sequence is now so drawn-out it makes Dragon Ball battles seem snappy. Seriously, a good twenty episodes into the big important climatic attack on the antagonist, the narrator announces only three minutes have passed. 
Speaking of the narrator, that’s the worst part about this arc. Almost every damn moment of episodes 100-120 is taken up by horribly written, contrived narration. Every move in the battle, every psychological state of every character is just spoon-fed by the narrator. It’s not like the directors were incapable of subtlety, most of the narration was completely unnecessary since Madhouse actually did a decent job at subtley portraying battle techniques and emotional dispositions (although the animation through this arc was the worst of the series). The moment you almost get into the atmosphere of a scene during the battle, the narrator’s there to break the fourth wall and ruin everything, destroying any emotional depth that could be salvaged. The whole point of a visual medium like a television series is to show us characters’ dispositions, motivations, and beliefs, or even the basic events of the plot, not just tell it to us. Otherwise, we might as well forego every single film adaptation of novels and stick to audiobooks. For the most part, this sub-arc felt more like an audiobook than an anime.
Worse yet, the events at the climax of the battle are as implausible as they are ridiculous. Gon’s happy and naïve character fantastically changes way too quickly into a bloodthirsty sadist during another revenge arc (because Kurapika’s been forgotten for about 80 episodes) as he seeks vengeance for another minor side character we’ve barely gotten to know. The battle hilariously escalates into ridiculousness. Character designs become downright stupid (at one point the antagonists turn into chibis and Gon looks like handsome Squidward with impossibly long hair), fights between minor side-characters we do not really care that much about are drawn out into three episode sequences, and things escalate beyond credulity.
When all the dust is settled, eight or so episodes are spent on the resolution to this arc. There are flashes of brilliance here and there, and you’re thankful the narrator has finally shut the hell up. The most notable moment is the finale for the main antagonist of this arc, Mereum, which was probably the best-directed scene of the series. It was so high-quality it felt out of place since the animation quality dipped during the battle. Other than that, there were a bunch of scenes that were supposed to be emotionally charged, but so many characters were introduced 30 or so episodes ago with little development in between, the viewer is mostly spent struggling to remember who was who and wondering why she should care. 
It’s a shame, this arc had a lot of potentials, but it was wasted on fantastically dumb battle sequences and contrived narration to shoehorn in as many new characters as possible rather than actually focus in on the few compelling characters and events in the arc. The most notable half-delivered promise of this arc was the rather rushed development of the main antagonist Mereum which was incredibly compelling before the battle. It’s amazing how the most drawn-out section of this anime managed to rush even the most important parts, like Gon’s dynamic change in his quest for revenge or Mereum’s battle between being an ant and a human. But hey, at least they didn’t just randomly forget key characters and plot elements from this arc like they did everywhere else.
The final mini-arc is when this series just got extremely tedious, boring, and entirely unenjoyable—even more tedious than the drawn-out battle sequence. Gon is injured from the big fight, Killua needs to go retrieve his sister who has some special power to heal him—who at this point we’ve never met and have no clue why Killua cares so much for her if he’s never mentioned her, but I guess expecting basic narrative coherence was out of the question at this point. This would be fine, except it keeps getting sidetracked with this tedious political drama about the Hunter organization trying to run an election which is mostly extremely dull bureaucratic dialogue with a bunch of crudely designed characters we’ve never met before who are introduced in a rushed fashion. Remember that infamous scene from the Phantom Menace where they sit in the Galactic Senate talking for too long? Imagine that for about six episodes worth of content. It’s miserable to watch.
It ends on a higher note. The stupid election bureaucracy fizzles out and it turns out to have mattered even less than we thought it did. Gon gets reunited with his father, which is nice enough. There’s a lack of satisfying resolve in Gon and Killua’s friendship, but after the 90 episodes of garbage, the last 3 or so were stronger. I suppose Madhouse deserves some credit for wrapping up an unfinished manga with a plausibly fulfilling ending.
Honestly, I do not really know why anyone takes this series all that seriously. This only deserves a small fraction of the hype and critical acclaim it gets. Maybe people are so desperate for a competently animated long-form shounen that is less than 500 episodes they’re willing to overlook the deep flaws in this show? It feels like a completely incoherent Dungeons and Dragons campaign run by a bunch of ADHD 11-year-olds on crack. Maybe you like the off-the-wall style of storytelling and the way it constantly and implausibly ups the ante on your willful suspension of disbelief. But even if so, it is downright frustrating when key characters and plot points are completely forgotten, when you have to sit through exposition after exposition, or when battles get as drawn out and cliché as they do in this series. The only reason it’s not getting a lower score is because Killua is a uniquely memorable and well-developed character, the first 50 or so episodes were at least enjoyable, and it does deserve some credit for being much more visually polished than most of its peers.
Consider how Hunter x Hunter compares with other long-form battle shounen that are notable for their mediocrity even during its most successful arcs . Compare it to, for example, Naruto or Shingeki no Kyojin. What keeps me hooked on a series like Naruto or SnK despite how deeply flawed they are is that they have coherent, well-defined and interesting worlds into which I can get somewhat immersed. If I’m investing more than 100 episodes in to a series, I want to get lost in the world. I can tolerate implausibly high-stakes battle sequences where the main character is just screaming like in SnK if the setting is interesting and the premise is compelling. I can sit through bland exposition of a new larger cast of characters 200 episodes into Naruto Shippuden if I get a sense of how they fit into the larger narrative in world. 
Sure, when Hunter x Hunter is at its best in the first third of the series it avoids some of the most glaring flaws of those shows with ridiculously drawn-out battle sequences, spoon-fed explanations, and constant escalation issues. However, it has no sense of immersion or coherent world-building at all since the setting and premise is so generic and never fully fleshed out. When there’s an attempt to give a sense of setting, the elements are randomly pulled out of someone’s ass on the spot with contrived narration and it usually contradicts whatever came before it. Even the city names are generic, lazy knock-offs like Yorknewcity or Pajing. Gon’s main attack is based off rock, paper, scissors, for Christ's sake. The result is when the few interesting main characters are absent and I’m forced to sit through more exposition of new characters and battle techniques or when it begins to fall into those bad shonen battle clichés during the Chimera Ant and Greed Island arcs, I just lose all sense of interest and watching the series becomes a dull exercise in perseverance. Ultimately, that lazy world-building and lack of coherence makes Hunter x Hunter even worse than most of the mediocre shounen to which it is favorably compared. Paired with the way key points are just dropped and forgotten for good and the cast of characters becomes so large and rushed, the whole series becomes downright frustrating.
At its best, Hunter x Hunter is a rather unremarkable battle shounen with a handful of memorable characters. At its worst, it’s a completely incoherent, tedious, barely watchable mess. At any given moment, it could be anything between those two extremes. Even though there are a lot of enjoyable moments and some good characters to salvage from the series, I have a hard time recommending this to all but the most hardcore of shounen fans.

                I often see people complain about a lack of originality when talking about anime titles without giving it proper thought. The very idea of ""being original"" is within itself a fallacy, especially when referring to any form of storytelling. Everything in one way or another draws inspiration from something else and seeking out ""original"" content shouldn't be an end goal for viewers. What one should look for is how the content itself is presented. A typical story setup is only hindered by the writer and execution of said story. Proper execution and presentation can often be what makes or breaks a show. And even a
                  show with a formulaic setup can be refreshing if handled properly. 
Nowhere is this more evident than with Hunter X Hunter (2011). On paper it's a standard fare shounen with all the commonalities and tropes that you'd expect from the demographic. But when presented what we get is arguably some of the best materiel you can ever expect from a battle shounen. No it isn't a ""masterpiece"" like many would constantly proclaim it to be but it certainly reaches ambitious heights very rarely seen with a genre that is usually juvenile at best. 
Story: 7/10
I'll try to refrain from reciting the synopsis:
The story, like I've already stated before, is nothing special. It can easily be summed up as character driven arcs with each core cast having their own objectives they wish to accomplish. What bring these individuals all together is the highly acclaimed job title of ""Hunter"". The title of Hunter, to save from a long winded explanation, are basically glorified Indiana Jones's positions. Receiving the title and getting the license to be one is like a VIP pass to do whatever the hell you want, may that be bounty ""hunting"", treasure ""hunting"", food ""hunting"", I think you get the gist of it. But the title itself is nothing but a means to an end and obtaining it is only the 1st step for our characters.
Despite Gon being our main protagonist, the story never neglects the core cast that befriends him. Through a given arc we as the audience get a shift in character focus depending on who the storyline corresponds to. Although Gon's journey still remains the overarching one, the others are properly fleshed out to stand on their own without including the MC.  For the most part anyway, unfortunately characters like Leorio never got his chance in the spotlight. With each arc and character focus brings it's own themes and conflict. May that be revenge and redemption as found with Kurapika's arc or self acceptance and discovery with Killua's. Each arc explores a given theme, which made the viewing experience to be more enriched. A balance was struck in it's presentation, making it heartwarming when called for it and awe inspiring when it needed to be. 
The world building and setting was another area that HxH excelled at. Everything felt well structured and was properly established. This is especially true for the show's fighting system known as ""nen"". It was extensively explained not only for the sake of the viewer but also to leave no room for asspulls that's normally common with shounens (looking at you Naruto asspull no jutsu). This intricate in-world power mechanics is only 2nd to that of FMA's mechanics behind alchemy. The various ways in which ""nen"" can be utilized led to some very interesting fights that was entertaining while being well thought out.
The pacing for the series can be best described as a roller coaster ride. The beginning of the ride is simply a slow climb up to get the participant's blood pumping for the intense drop after they reach the summit. HxH knew how to properly set the stage before the main events happen, something many shounens tend to rush. Since we spend time establishing everything from the setting to the characters involved for the given arc, these well written buildup episodes are what help give certain events substance and weigh behind it. It wasn't just tension-less conflicts between characters, it became something that you got invested in. 
Of course nothing is perfect and HxH had it's fair share of missteps. One noticeable one can be seen on an overview. While Gon's story tied most of the arcs together, looking at the content of each arc separately shows a lack of unification among them. They simply weren't thematically related or constructed. We go from tournament arc to revenge arc to ""stuck in a video game"" arc to killer creatures arc. There wasn't any core themes that brought them all together. The transition between them was fine but that never changed the fact that they never quite fit together.
Another issue that arises was with it's themes. It felt like they could of done a lot more with the material presented. Prime example being the Chimera arc. they skimmed over it but never explored it.  They had the option to use the Chimera Ants in a allegorical way to display themes such as subservience, the human condition and Social Darwinism. Something similar to what they did in Shinsekai Yori and books like Animal Farm. Animals/creatures have always been the perfect proxy for those kind of themes but they never went that route and simply reduced it to cleverly written shounen fights. It was ideas that sounded good but went nowhere or was never brought up at all. No one's expecting a shounen with FMA's level of complexity but it would of certainly been a nice addition.
Also something else that hindered HxH was it's conclusions. Nothing to do with what's presented itself but the limited material the studio had to work with due to the mangaka Togashi's infamous hiatuses. This results in an ending while satisfying, left many plot points and questions unanswered. The story still wraps up nicely but could of been more conclusive.  
Art/Animation: 7/10
Animated by Madhouse there should be little question of the show's integrity in terms of animation. Now it isn't anything to write home about or would leave you giving a standing ovation but what HxH have that most long running titles don't is consistency. From beginning to end it never had noticeable hiccups that distracted from the content displayed. It was brightly lit when needed and ominous during times that called for it. A show that knew how to manipulate its color palette to fit the tone of any given scene. And trying my best not to give away spoilers here but episodes like 36 and 116 were prime examples of this. 
Characters: 8/10
Possibly the biggest highlight of the series comes with the characters themselves. If looked at individually very few warrant a character study but as a whole the interactions among them is what stands out. Everyone that's important to the narrative are all given a solid motive to which they strive for. They aren't simply stuck in supporting role, they take an active part in moving the story along. While many of them were fairly common placed archetypes some in particular were actually fleshed out and received actual development. Meruem for example being a character that experienced a catharsis which brought on change in his ideology and perspective in regards to the value of others. This may seem insignificant in other shows but in a genre that reduces villains to being bombastic 1 dimensional megalomaniacs seeing an antagonist with dimensions to his character was very refreshing. Killua being another rare exception for being a character that suffered from an internal strife and inferiority complex. This provided layered characterization to what would normally just be your standard badass. While Gon and a few others remained your dime a dozen characters their organic chemistry is what makes them stand out. (Oh and Hisoka is the best sadistic assassin ever, no this is not debatable, it's a fact lol)
This is a case where the whole was greater than the sum of it's parts. They were an endearing bunch that showed believable interaction among each other.  
Enjoyment: 7/10
HxH had its slow pacing during buildups and other issues thematically but it's certainly a show I thoroughly enjoyed. It's been a long time since I was ever immersed into a long running shounen and I honestly thought I had outgrew that demographic. But what HxH did that many failed to do was capture that sense of adventure and admiration I had when I was younger. It felt nostalgic, a feeling of familiarity that I only had as a child when watching Saturday morning cartoons. And to me that was well worth the investment.  
Overall: 7/10
HxH is simply a rare breath of fresh air in a genre that has grown stale. It provided well thought out fights, contains a memorable cast and was thoroughly entertaining with lots of jaw dropping highlights. Of course it had it's issues but overall the title had a lot more going for it. As someone that has grown tired of shounens I was quite impressed with what HxH had to offer. It was engaging, it was potent and most of all it left me with a sense of satisfaction upon completion.",7

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
Ok, before you click on the not helpful button just because I rated this series a 7. Which from what I'm seeing the majority of reviews are dashing out 10/10 left and right. Time to have some variety in these hxh reviews. ;)
First thing I'll have to admit is that when I first watch this series it was so goofy, Gon fighting with a fishing rod was such a turn off, I thought this series would be another fairy tale with no dark element in it, oh boy was I wrong. 
Story 7/10. The story  starts off with Gon and his
                  soon to be friends which are Killua, Kurapika and  Leorio who has set out a task of entering the hunter exam to be a official hunter. Now the story does branch off to other sub plots after they became hunters. For eg. Kurapika story which was in the Yorknew city arc, and imo was the best arc in the entire series, it had drama thriller action, interesting dialogue everything in it was perfect. The beginning of this series was quite slow and uninteresting, all the arcs I watch was just good nothing great or spectacular except for the Yorknew city arc, after the greed island arc the chimera ant arc came into play, and imo this arc felt out of place I didn't feel like I was watching hxh anymore, ants coming out of nowhere devouring people and wants to rule the world, so unoriginal. The pacing in the series started to drop the story in my honest opinion was not interesting each episode I watch in the chimera ant arc was just ok, nothing special. I did enjoy the Ikalgo episode though, the mind game was awesome in that episode, there were a few other good gem in the chimera ant arc as well.
Art 8/10 The art in this series was really crisp and nicely drawn, I rarely saw the art being bad or having bad animation, I think madhouse  did a very good job in this series when it comes to the art.
Sound 6/10. This was the weakness part in the series for me, yes, there is some good soundtrack in it, but the majority of soundtracks imo didn't fit the atmosphere or scene of what was happening at the moment in the series. What makes the soundtrack even more disappointing is that they reuse the same soundtrack over and over in each episode. I think they needed more soundtrack for this series. The variety of soundtrack in this series was poor imo.
Characters 7/10. The characters in hxh is good imo. Each characters have depth in them, the only person that felt one dimmensional to me was Gon, overall I can see why a lot of people liked the characters in hxh even the antagonist as well. Also Togashi did a good job in making us hear the thoughts of the characters even the villain as well, this gives them more depth and I think that was one of the major reason why a lot of people got attach to the antagonist in this series, me personally I didn't. The new characters in the chimera ant arc that are on the good side was just too much imo, and I wasn't interested in none of them, except Ikalgo.;) So when I was watching a episode focus on these new character I wasn't interested at all which made my experience unsatisfactory. Too much new characters were introduce at once in this arc.
Enjoyment 7/10. This part is kinda tricky. I enjoyed this series but I also got bored to hell out of it as well, especially in the greed island arc and the chimera ant arc. I was bored to hell. But I think it was balance out. Some episode was just drag out and it felt like nothing happen the pacing imo got slow in the chimera ant arc, which took up the majority of this series, so it affected me a lot on the enjoyment part and also the overall of the series, plus you can factor in things like me not interested in the new characters or the lvl 1 ant characters, not talking about the royal guards if anyone is wondering, which our heroes did have to face.
Overall 7.5/10. Overall I had a blast with this series I started to watch it in 2013 so I came in late in this series. This series was overall a good series imo, if you notice I didn't say anything was out right bad in hxh, hxh did a good job in most of these categories, but for me it just did a good job not anything that will make me go ""Woah"" or anything extra ordinary, it was just a good series and it was overall good. I personally think this series is overrated just by seen the amount of 10/10 it's getting and also hxh looks like it will soon to be in the top 5 on mal. Any ways just like everyone else it's just a opinion, and I just wanted to share it with whoever is reading this.
Thnx for reading.",7

Note: This is to any newcomers to the series. No spoilers in this review.
	It has been a long time that I watched an anime that evaluates and explores many aspects of the genre, especially coming from a Shonen demographic anime. While I started watching this series, I was skeptical from the anime by watching the first five episodes, considering that it brings a light-hearted, child-like feel. I stopped watching it for a while because it didn't bring any interesting I found captivating. As time passed by, I doubted myself for not even continuing this series. Many older fans
                  of anime get thrown off by the demographic how anime such as Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Fairy Tail,etc demonstrate a protagonist in search for glory to become someone important and known to others. Antagonists are shown later in the series soon later confronts the hero in a long-dragging, continuous fight. Eventually, the hero will overcome their goal during a long voyage of his traveling with their friends in either constantly wining in every single battle with their closest rivals, having a bigger ambition to accomplish to become ""someone"" important, or  making a difference in their power level in a outrageous moment while being in a ridiculous, near death, battle..These characteristics of what these series provided hindered me from watching a long, ongoing anime from predictable wins and losses from the Shonen heroes. However, one anime takes all these Shonen tropes and throw it out of the window. That anime is Hunter X Hunter.
Story: The premise of the story takes us to a journey in Whale Island with our hero, Gon Freecss, a young 12 year boy who is destined to become a talented hunter just like his father, Ging, who is a legendary hunter known to many. Hunters are highly skilled professional fighters who have the exceptional ability to lure others into a trap at will, find uncommon creatures at sea or land, or search for undiscovered treasures.  On his quest, he finds other companions such as Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio who also strived to have the same goal to become the best hunter while they participate in the Hunter Exam. This appears to be like a typical, light-hearted Shonen premise in most cases. The pacing in the beginning of the series can commences very slowly for most people. This creates a hindrance with older audience who are used to Seinen type anime such as Monster, Berserk, Gantz, etc. However, gradually, the development of the story arcs within each episodes creates a further relationship between each character in a more complicated situations. While it appears to be a cheerful, humorous at first, it ultimately alludes how each story links up to create a further character development for a protagonist Shonen hero like Gon to overcome mentally and physically especially in the 6th arc of the series, the Chimera Ants Arc. Over the course of the episodes, the arc steadily deconstructs the elements of  the Shonen demographic into a true brutal, psychological nature of what it really means to be a hunter or even a human. As the story progresses within each episode, you will appreciate what the previous arcs has to offer in order to fully understand how the characters feel, hell even the villains' motivations and thoughts as well.
Art/Animation: Madhouse studio did an excellent job adapting Yoshihiro Togashi's (creator of Yu Yu Hakusho) long hiatus manga since 1998 into a more faithful anime adaptation. They keep up with the action orientated sequences fluid into constant beating from facial expression, anticipation, and even suspense. However, some older fans from the 1999 version may disprove of how ""colorful"" art style that the show presented from facial expression and animation wise. But, I'm not going to go into details with the flame war between two series from 1999 and 2011. They also meticulously improved the quality that the original manga drawing lack into a more vivid, watchable experience. For example, the character designs in the manga are considered poorly drawn due to Togashi's long hiatus since his sickness is very challenging overcome for years. This Conclusively, Madhouse excelled Hunter X Hunter manga into a more faithful adaptation it deserves story wise. 
Sound/Music:  At first, the opening of the anime really suited to the atmosphere and how really addicted the song can really be. Even though the opening theme, ""Departure"" by Ono Masatoshi doesn't change arc after arc, the song becomes a tradition that really suits the mood of the show. It appeal repels me from watching every second of the episode that I couldn't stop watching episode after episode without knowing what is going to happen next. It brings such strong anticipation and curiosity to viewers what is the next moment is about to happen. The music sets the setting of traveling and exploring the world of Hunter X Hunter. It gives off how much is there in the world that is undiscovered. In the future,  people will looked back and feel nostalgic how the atmosphere suits very well in the HxH universe. 
Character: This is where the anime leaves positive note on how well-written the character development really is. While Togashi was writing the manga his hiatus on the manga really makes the story more unique than most Shonen series I witnessed since they emphasis long term fights, rather than a thought-out character development. Gon and Killua are like yin and yang. They build a long, ongoing friendship through the series, learning and knowing their weakness they have to overcome. Not only the main characters have to conquer their own conflicts in each arc, even some minor/supporting characters get screen time in some episode so they wouldn't appear to have a very generic, one dimensional personality. Within each episode, the characters flesh out their morality from what is right or wrong. While in battle, the anime dives into their consciousness on how they can resolve the situation. Tactics and skills play a very important role in the Hunter X Hunter universe. You have to ask yourself, is killing your sworn enemy really going to bring satisfaction for everyone? Can your desire really lead to contentment for your own preservation? These questions lead you to think that the characters are not always what they seemed to be when you start to watch how they first interact each other.
Enjoyment:  Personally, I found this anime to be worth of my time, if not the best. Masterfully well-developed writing. Though-out tactics to weaken an opponent rather than random overpowered abilities for no particular reason. The only downside is the pacing might start off slow in the beginning, but Hunter X Hunter truly delivers what a classic Shonen anime can be without dragging its viewers into  unnecessary cliché. At first the show starts to grow as an innocent, cheerful child then it matures into a merciless, cold-hearted butcher regarding to the characters' dark past and essential role that will affect them emotionally and ethically later on in the series. Each have their own motives they have to undergo mentally. I enjoy every minute of humor yet complicated growth of each character the series has build to recent episode.
Overall: The anime has surprised me in a so many ways that I just want more from its universe. As of today, the manga is on hiatus due to Togashi's back pains. Who knows when the manga is going to come back? Maybe in two years or even a decade from now. What we know now is that Hunter X Hunter is exceptional to the Shonen tropes that most common anime suffer from. After years of watching anime, I never witnessed of how unforeseen this anime can be from the same demographic as the big 3. For any one that is new to the anime, go watch it now. Be patient and you will gradually be rewarded for one of the best writing you will ever experience in a Shonen anime.",10

                Whenever Shonen Jump releases anime based on a popular manga they are usually for the fighting and story enthusiasts. Hunter X Hunter is a show that balances the two perfectly in the form of a Yin-Yang.  Although this story is fiction, it’s still based on some part of the truth of the real world we reside in. The story is brutal, deep, emotional, breathtaking and much more! A story that is different, but yet has the same basic elements you would expect from a Shonen anime. I won’t go into details of the story or the arc because I can’t mention that without spoiling
                  but I’m going to express what I can in whatever words while keep it short and sweet. 
Hunter X Hunter mainly focuses on a Young boy named Gon Freecss who like his father wants to become a Hunter. He wants to experience what the world of Hunters is like and why his father left him to attain the wonders of that world. You can say that Gon wants to look for his father and ask him this question and that sets a goal for the narrative for the anime. Now, with this type of narrative, the Hunter X Hunter universe sets itself to become everlasting much like One-Piece and Toriko, where various arcs can come about without going astray from the initial plot and connect each other with everything else within the medium. You can think of it as a programming flowchart that is always connected to the main command. What really sets the story apart from others is the way it’s told. Its starts of slow, puzzling and full of questions but slowly starts to unravel itself and it gets really interesting as the arcs progress forward. Personally, no arc for me was boring. Every single one of them had something different and unique to offer from the introduction to new characters to foes and bros and new unexplored land which keep everything fresh and interesting. This is something that I feel makes Togashi-sensei such a spectacular author. Another great thing about the series is that Gon isn't the only main character of the series. There are a few more who are later introduced in the series which is what makes Hunter X Hunter special and different which hence makes more room for different types of arcs with different variations.
As you go deeper into the story you will see how complex, intriguing and thought provoking Hunter X Hunter actually becomes. A lot of the arcs in this show changed my perspective of how I looked at the world and the kind of potential it has of becoming, but at the same time it also made me think about the type of creation we are and negative impacts it brings to the table.
In terms of animation and sound, this show probably has the most beautiful and the most precise animation I have seen for a long running series. The manga was very lucky to not have been picked by garbage studios like Toei or A-1, instead it was picked up by one of the best ones in Japan, Mad-House. Mad-House studio is known for its amazing animation and to have consistency in all of its long running 148 episodes is a feat. Animation is spectacular. Togashi isn’t a very good drawer when compared to other manga artists but the anime comes and rescues that part of the story. As for OST, it’s pretty good. There are tracks that are pretty awesome here and there and fit the mood perfectly. You will enjoy the animation and sound for this show. I follow some of the staff members who work on Hunter X Hunter at Madhouse Studios and they love this manga very much and they put a lot of effort to make it perfect.
Finally, I know I’ve praised this show a lot, but I feel there is no reason not because, as I see it, Hunter X Hunter is a masterpiece. It is slow to start off with like any other show, but once you get past the first few episodes, you will start to enjoy the show and that’s mainly what hooks a person as he/she starts to gain interest. I always mention this is the reviews and tell people that fighting isn’t everything in a Shonen manga/anime. Sometimes having a good story that keeps the audience at bay and keeps them guessing is what you need in a story and Hunter X Hunter delivers. Over the course of 3 years this show has become my favorite anime of all time and it was sad to see it come to an end. Sure the manga still continues (very slowly) but surely so I hope to see more of it in the future. With that I say good-bye to a spectacular anime which is a MUST watch for all!
Final Score:  Master Piece (10/10)",10
"
                A 10/10 review for Hunter X Hunter 2011 is nothing new on this website: plenty of people have already eloquently described what makes the show such an incredible experience, and for that I'm glad. The show deserves all of the praise that it receives. The reason I decided to write this review, however, was not merely to explain what makes the show so great, it's to convince you to try to watch it. If you're anything like me then the fact that Hunter X Hunter has 148 episodes can be a little daunting: that's a hell of a commitment for a single story. In conjunction
                  with this, the show's kiddy art style and first few episodes don't really seem to be indicative of a higher level of storytelling. To top it off, all of those gleaming reviews are a bit of a double-edged blade: going into anything with such high expectations can ruin the experience, and many solid shows have been brought to their knees by over-enthusiastic fans who build them up to be more than they could ever hope to be.
I had all of these doubts when I went into the show. I usually stay away from anything longer than 50 episodes, I didn't believe that anything truly compelling could be spawned from Hunter X Hunter's sugar-coated beginnings and that the show was getting a lot of credit just for having zany ideas and a good sense of humor, and I had heard both strangers and people I respected tell me over and over again that this was the one: the fantasy epic that did it right, that only continued to get better over time right up until its stunning conclusion. If you're feeling any of those reluctances, if you've started the show and just can't seem to be able to get past the first few episodes, know that I was right there with you. Even as the show's first arc came to a close I still didn't consider it to be anything more than ""well thought-out fun"". But dear reader, I URGE you not to fall into that pitfall. I URGE you, if you have any fondness for the world of Hunter X Hunter, if there is any inkling inside you that says ""I might be able to dig this"", PRESS ONWARDS. The reviewers are right and the legends are true: Hunter X Hunter delivers one of the most sprawling, powerful stories of all time. It went in directions I hadn't even considered. It was one of four shows to ever force tears out of my eyes. It delivered powerful stories time and again, and it tied everything together with a conclusion about the meaning of life itself. 
As for the review itself, it seems cheap to merely ride off of the backs of other reviewers, no? Let me give my own two cents at what makes this masterpiece so compelling.
Hunter X Hunter is a shonen. It's several tiers ahead of every other shonen I've watched, but it still does have a focus on battles and conflict. What sets it apart is that there's actually usually very little animation involved in the Hunter X Hunter fights: instead of showing the fast-paced high-energy showdown of two characters from the point of view of a third party, Hunter X Hunter takes the internal route. It shows the thought processes of the characters throughout the course of the battle and it makes sure to lay down a tangible battlefield so that you can understand exactly what's happening. Tactics and experience play a HUGE role in combat in Hunter X Hunter: strength doesn't prevail by itself, it's the ability to put it to creative use that makes the victor. Psychological warfare is also a common strategy, with combatants using attitude and knowledge about their opponent to get opponents that may hold huge advantages over them to make stupid mistakes. People don't just fight for the sake of it in Hunter X Hunter: they fight for discernible reasons, whether it be to protect someone or avenge someone or out of pride or stubbornness or fear, and the motivations behind every conflict often play a role in the outcomes themselves. Speaking of which, Hunter X Hunter isn't really all about the ""who wins"" part of fighting. It is rare that it resolves story arcs in straightforward and clean-cut ways, always choosing to honor the choices its characters would make over whatever expectations people may have. This can lead to surprisingly happy and simple resolutions, or it can lead to a morally convoluted clusterfuck that seems to fall apart more than it does resolve itself. 
The characters themselves are one-of-a-kind: in part, this is due to the undeniable uniqueness of their personalities and character designs. However, it's also due to the show's respect for each and every one of the people it introduces. Hunter X Hunter is a forgiving world, where assassins can become heroes and serial killers can command respect and rise to the top. But it's also a harsh one, where people's misguidance can have disastrous consequences and where virtues can be a double-edged sword. In it, everyone has a voice, a goal or goals, a chance to make a difference. Whether it be a previously undeveloped face in the sea of Hunter Exam applicants or an octopus sniper that just happens to be stumbled upon, there are no extras or standbyers in Hunter X Hunter. The ideals of its central protagonists are valued no more than anybody else's, and stories are created and resolved not through convenience but by the show's immense living breathing cast. Each character's story is their own: whatever they may achieve during their time in the show, they have no obligation to stick around for the next phase of the story if they belong somewhere else, and they have no obligation to resolve any of their personal struggles just because the main protagonists are there. Those are something for them to figure out in their own time. What this does is it creates a world brimming with energy and passion, a world where you find yourself simultaneously invested in an unbelievable number of characters because they all feel like individuals, a world where you're constantly on the edge of your seat to see what happens next because 'convenience' has been kicked to the curb. This isn't to say that the show's main protagonists aren't important: quite the opposite, it is their brilliant character arcs that sell the show's ending and create some of the show's most powerful moments. However, the show never gets swallowed by them and it never gives them any more influence on the outcome than they deserve.
The execution of the show is constantly top-notch as well. Animated by studio Madhouse (famous for shows like Death Note and always able to adapt to the tone of any show), Hunter X Hunter looks absolutely pristine for the entirety of its 148 episode run. It uses crisp, clean lines, bright colors and an indescribable glow to its shots that elevate it in the visuals department while making sure that it has its own unique style: it isn't just ""pretty""; I could recognize a screenshot from Hunter X Hunter in an instant even if it had no distinguishing characters or story elements in it. The sound is great: the show uses the same opening for the entirety of its run, and oftentimes uses slow instrumental versions of it for the OST during the episode as well. The soundtrack is for the most part a series of the same few songs redone in different ways for different moods, but when the show shifts gears later on into a far grittier and unprecedented arc the soundtrack shifts entirely to reflect the changing protagonists and the alien situations they are now finding themselves in. The voice acting is superb, with a cast that nails the fun and breezy feel of the show but is wholely capable of turning up the intensity when shit goes down. I place an immense value on the literal written dialogue of a show: not just the story or the thoughts behind the characters, but in the way that they interact and their thoughts are portrayed. In this regard more than anything, Hunter X Hunter exceeded my expectations with a script that never dragged and was comfortable and natural switching from long-winded explanations to well-delivered humor to drama and existential woe. Some of the show's most powerful scenes owe themselves to the writing, using just the right words in the right ways to convey what was trying to be said.
Did I love watching Hunter X Hunter? Absolutely. Would I watch it again? Absolutely. Would I recommend it to anyone with even the slightest inkling of a desire to try it? Absolutely. There's only one thing you need to enjoy Hunter X Hunter, and that's an open mind. If you go into its lucrative antics, nonsensical world and over-the-top characters and conflicts with an open mind, you will find one of the most compelling, tragic, powerful and ingenious adventure epics of all time, full of heart and unforgiving to anyone who fails to recognize that the greatest treasure in life is the road one takes on the way to where they are going.

"
                What makes a show great? Is it the engaging story? Is it the interesting characters? Is it the immersion the show creates? I find myself always asking these questions whenever I start a series. Hunter x Hunter was no exception. I hadn't heard much when I first started it, but I had heard comparisons to Fullmetal Alchemist and Attack on Titan, both of which are some of my favorite shounens. Still, I had my doubts. ""148 episodes? How could there possibly be that much interesting plot without fillers?"" I asked. I was a fool.
Let me tell you right now, 148 episodes is not enough. I
                  would give anything for more episodes of arguably the most outstanding series I have ever had the good fortune of watching. 
Story - I'm not going to go into detail about the story; you can read the synopsis for that. I'll instead talk about the storytelling itself. The story starts off fairly interesting and grows exponentially more interesting per episode/arc. The author, Togashi, has an amazing sense of pacing; some plots take several episodes to resolve, but so much happens in each episode that it becomes something that enhances the show. The story is also incredibly immersive because of how well Togashi builds the HxH world. As you follow the main characters on their journey, you learn more and more about just how expansive and unique the world is. There's always something new to explore, which really does make the show feel like an adventure.
Each arc varies in tone. The show starts off pretty light, and gradually gets darker. My god does it get darker. Not to imply that the light arcs are inferior; they're still immensely enjoyable. The show just contains many different forms of entertainment. The darker arcs will include scenarios and scenes of such intensity, drama, and action, that you won't understand how anyone could've possibly waited a week for the next episode. Lastly, there's one element in the story that snuck up on me and transformed into something so beautiful and moving that I simply didn't know what to do with myself. 
10/10
Characters - There are very few ways to adequately describe how brilliantly the author writes such likeable, unique, and interesting characters. And I mean all of them. This is a rare kind of show where every time I see a character come back after not being around, I feel such joy seeing them. Especially the villains - you will love the villains so much that you legitimately will not know who to root for at many parts in the series. The show often develops villains so much that I found myself at times hating a ""good guy"" just because of what they did to a ""bad guy"".
10/10
Sound - I know this upsets many people but I enjoy watching dubbed anime. However, this is on my short list of shows where the voice acting in Japanese is so good, I'm afraid of a dub being made because I honestly don't think the characters can be done justice. I'm even afraid to watch the original 1999 version because the voice actors are different.
As for the soundtrack, I don't have much to say. The soundtrack fits the show remarkably well, however there's nothing particularly outstanding about it (save for a few episodes, when a ""requiem"" is played for a certain character for example).
9/10
Art - The art studio Madhouse really brought their A-game. Their production of this show is almost paramount to how enjoyable it is. As great as the manga is, it wouldn't have been nearly as enjoyable without the stunning artwork and directing that Madhouse designed. 
10/10
Enjoyment - This is pretty self-explanatory at this point. If I could erase my knowledge of any anime and watch it from the beginning, it would likely be this one. Hell, at this point I'd gladly watch 30 episodes of pure filler just to see more of the characters and the world.
10/10
Regardless of the genres you enjoy, Hunter x Hunter is guaranteed to be a breath of fresh air. Togashi seems to have a penchant to subvert almost every trope and cliche in the book, leaving you guessing at every turn. The result is a brilliant and captivating piece of entertainment, guaranteed to captivate you like almost no other show can. Whatever your answer to the question ""what makes a series great?"" is, know that Hunter x Hunter has it.
P.S. Hisoka is love, Hisoka is life.",10

                - Sorry for bad english -
HxH is the anime that most pissed me off. Not for the anime itself, but for how people describe and think of it. Nothing and I say nothing of what I read in reviews from 8 upwards is true. Many things are subjective but others are clearly huge, full-blown lies.
Let's start by saying that the overall quality of the anime drops steadily from episode 1 to the end. It seems that the writer wanted to surprise viewers with something unexpected, even if it is senseless.
I've always criticized Naruto for the high number of filler episodes but in HxH it's not
                  the episodes that are fillers, BUT THE DAMN ARCS
Apart from the first 15 episodes which, together with another arc are ok (yorknew arc), the rest is the essence of complete uselessness.
Arc after arc you keep thinking the previous arc was better but it's actually like comparing sh*t to sh*t with powdered sugar on it. You think the arc was better before just because what you are seeing now sucks even more.
It must be said that the arc of the mafia (ep 37-58) was not bad but then, in episode 80, the arc of the ant chimera begins.
80 f**king boring training episodes where the protagonist doesn't even know how to use a single skill just to throw me into the chimera arc?
(They talk about ants but in this arc I only see a panda and a f**king penguin in the middle of the desert.)
Finally someone dies (it seems they do it to show you that the anime has now matured)
I did not believe it when I saw it .. the bad guys who make proud disagreements before they die when you don't even know they are and you empathize with them as you empathize with a fly when you accidentally step on it.
Apart from the fact that you can find a better story in Dragonball and Naruto,(which are pretty much the same but done well xD - there is an arc that is basically sao lol ?why? ahah) it must be said that it sucks more than these two for one simple reason. Where the anime begins, that is, in episode 80, in a f**king battle shonen there is only ONE FIGHT. IN 50 EPISODES. ONLY ONE FIGHT IN 50 EPISODES nonononono ... 
Then they give you a beautiful explanation on how the fights and techniques work and then you put only one? (bad among other things, except the animations that were there) A single fight where they don't even use the techniques they explained to you before breaking your balls.
The characters are all flat, especially the villains. The only nice one I have to admit is Kurapika. Leorio is actually a nice character but he never screentime. Gon is annoying and Killua is the usual stereotype of a dark eleven year old when he's with friends, and badass op when he has to fight.
Meruem is a hideous villain. He is the classic villain who wants to take over the world (classic bad that becomes good). And then is shamelessly copied by Cell from Dragonball.
The graphics in general are not bad, apart from some cringe and useless character designs. The arch of the mafia remains the best in this field too.
The Ost are horrendous apart from one
The ending is the worst and most obvious I've ever seen in an anime
Overall it is a childish anime, boring, useless and clearly badly copied from other more famous works.
Watch Dragonball or Naruto if you want to see such a thing, but done right.
Peace",4

                ""You should enjoy the little detours in life to the fullest, because that's where you'll find things more important than what you want."" - Ging Freecss
Hunter x Hunter 2011 is a unique beast of a show. It sits in a strange limbo between genres in a space all its own, like some kind of odd Chimera of shounen and seinen. At first glance it appears to be a rather childish show, with an art style composed entirely of cartoonish proportions, large eyes and bright colors, which stems initially from Togashi's manga style. In fact, without any outside input, one would not be wrong to assume
                  it was targeted at children. But under this initial layer of bright colors, and messages of friendship and loyalty, lies a deeper, darker show than anyone could have initially imagined. Questions of what it means to be human, what constitutes a life well-lived, and other topics that would not be out of place in serious adult dramas. One could say that I have stared into the abyss, and I am here to tell you that the abyss has most definitely stared into me.
Story - 10/10. Story telling is really Togashi's specialty. He crafts a continuous and satisfying narrative from start to finish, with excellent pacing, lovable characters, and some entirely unexpected twists along the way. Characters aside, the story itself is fairly straightforward - Gon, the protagonist, wants to become a ""Hunter"" not for the benefits the title confers, but so he can find his father, who abandoned Gon as an infant so he could follow his own dreams (hence the name of the show - Gon becomes a ""Hunter Hunter""). Along the way, Gon encounters a variety of characters that each have their own relative significance, makes friends and enemies, and undergoes any number of trials and adventures. But this straightforward story is presented and executed in such a way that it feels very organic and comfortable. This comfortable feeling serves as a waypoint during the darker points in the story, a lighthouse of sorts to guide one through the moral murkiness and sadness that the story presents. 
          The story covers what is now a total of 7 story arcs, each with their own self-contained narrative. These arcs vary in length greatly - the shortest covers only 5 episodes, while the largest spans a time-consuming chunk of 61 total episodes - over a third of the entire show. But none of these feel out of place - each one seems to last only as long as it really needs to, and none of them feel as if they left too early, nor that they overstayed their welcome. Given that some episodes take 23 minutes to cover 5 seconds of in-world time, this is a marvel of pacing and narration. Some points are slower than others, particularly the beginning episodes of each arc, but at no point does it feel as if it is dragging. This is due in part to the complete lack of filler content - aside from one ""recap"" type episode, each episode of the show presents some kind of story-relevant material, so it always feels like the story is moving forward. All of these factors combined come together to create an overarching narrative that feels very much as if it were adhering to the quote at the top of this review - this is a show, and a story, that focus very much on the journey, the PROCESS of going somewhere, instead of on the destination.
Art - 8/10. Madhouse has always been hailed as a studio that produces high-quality work, and this show is no different. It is not always the pinnacle of visual quality, but like the story, the visual quality remains at a very consistent and pleasing level. At no point is it glaringly obvious that they neglected to spread the budget properly. High moments (i.e. the major fight sequences) have appropriately high quality, while those in-between sort of segments maintain a pleasing, but not excessive level of detail.
         My one main gripe with the animation of the show is the amount of time dedicated to hand-to-hand combat in the show. In a show that is predominantly about martial artists engaging in battles, there is a somewhat disappointing lack of choreography. Very rarely do you see two characters exchanging blows directly, even if both of them specialize in hand-to-hand melee combat. This is ultimately not enough to knock a point off of the score, but is something I would have liked to see more of.
Sound - 8/10. Much like the art, the sound quality stays at a consistent and pleasing level throughout the entire show. Any complaints here are simply my own personal tastes, i.e. I don't very much enjoy the opening song that is used for the entire show, and some of the background pieces that play during the show feel sometimes out of place. But when the music needs to deliver, it does in spades.
          One thing I feel that is worth noting is that the show is obviously very aware of the value of silence. At a few points, there is no music at all, which, I feel, greatly increases the impact of these scenes. Very often now, we see shows that seem to feel as if music must ALWAYS be playing in the background, and when a show goes the opposite direction and uses silence, it creates a wonderful distinction.
Characters - 10/10. If the overall story is the bones of Hunter x Hunter, then the characters are the muscles and organs - the ""heart"" of the show. These are the elements of a story that allow us to connect with it personally, to draw parallels between the world that a story presents and our own reality. Inhuman or inorganic characters can completely break the immersion of a story, or if it presents characters that we dislike in a way that feels unrealistic. Togashi excels at creating likable and relatable characters, who each have his or her own (relatively) understandable motivations. The characters develop in a meaningful and noticeable way over the course of the story, lending them a definitively human feeling. Morality is very subjective in this show - very few characters fall into a black and white ""good vs evil"" morality. In fact, I would say that this show does not have a moral ""grey area,"" it has instead a ""moral rainbow,"" a multitude of different motivations and moral scales that interact with each other in an ever-changing spread of different moral hues. We see ""good"" characters exhibit emotional and perhaps even ""evil"" behaviors, while at the same time in a different place, our ""villains"" may be helping to save someone they care about, an action one would normally consider to be a ""good"" action. I would like to believe that this show does not have heroes and villains - it simply has protagonists and antagonists, two parties working in opposite, but equally understandable and justifiable directions.
Enjoyment - 10/10. I think it would come as no surprise that this is my verdict after the review above, but this is my place to reiterate that I believe this show is a masterpiece of storytelling. To have so many exceptional moments, emotions, and wonderful landmarks packed into 148 episode worth' of show is nothing short of spectacular. Togashi and Madhouse have worked together to create what I think is one of the best stories - not anime, not shows, but stories - of all time. Highly recommended.",10

                I came to know the original version of HxH since years ago. At first, the only thing I cared about in the series was the Hunter exam. I just wanted to know what kind of test it was so I tried watching it and surprisingly, I loved both the story and the characters after a few episodes. Years later, I was delighted when I heard about the reboot and from start to finish, Hunter x Hunter (2011) doesn't disappoint.
The story starts with Gon, a 12-year-old boy who sets out for a journey to find his father and his first step is to become a Hunter.
                  A Hunter is an individual who has enough luck and talent to pass the Hunter exam. A Hunter specializes in something, can be practically anything, you name it. A Hunter lives by a power system called Nen in a universe that cleverly reflects the dark side of our real world.
Essentially, being a Hunter isn't special but when it's combined with a well-designed power system and universe, it means infinite possibilities and I have to say Yoshihiro Togashi brilliantly executes that.
This series has all shounen elements but doesn't follow generic shounen patterns. It begins simply but gradually gets more complex and very unpredictable. A journey of the protagonist and his friends to achieve their goals is as reasonable and realistic as it can get. It has many details, takes time and consists of both success and failure. The MCs don't get a privilege to have special powers or suddenly get stronger for no reasons. They train and evolve as the story progresses. On the other hand, the antagonists don't just act out of pure evil. Their reasons are justifiable in different perspectives.
HxH has 7 arcs. Each one is related but has its own conflict and uniqueness. My personal favorite is the Yorknew arc from episode 39-58. After each arc, the concept of Hunter is explored bit by bit and you will keep getting a bigger picture of the whole Hunter universe. The atmosphere varies from a light-hearted shounen to one of the darkest seinen to fit each arc so it keeps things fresh and intriguing. Each fight is mostly strategic-based and relatively short. It's clever and never defies the logic of Nen.
Apart from the story, the best thing about the series is the characters. For me, characters make or break the show and HxH characters are top-notch. They really make the series shine.
Most, if not, all characters and their relationships are realistic because they are imperfect. Not only the MCs, many supporting characters have also undergone a substantial amount of development through the course of the series. Most of them are round characters with distinctive personalities, appearances, backgrounds, powers, ambitions and the ability to think. Their actions are driven by their own judgment as an individual, not what the plot requires them to do so it's very easy to sympathize with them, even the antagonists.
In term of production, HxH has unique art style with great and very consistent animation for a series that has over 100 episodes. The pacing is satisfying because there are no fillers at all. Voice actors and actresses are suitable for each character. OPs, EDs and OSTs are good even if there is only one opening song so far.
As for the negatives, there isn't a major problem in the series and all the minor ones i.e. change of narration style and slow pacing in 6th arc, repetitive op song, long absence of a character etc. didn't bother me as much. If anything, I think the only reason you shouldn't watch HxH now is because the manga is still ongoing. Despite a somewhat satisfying conclusion, you could call these 148 episodes a season one and honestly, you will not get a season two, not anytime soon considering the hiatus history of Togashi.
All in all, Hunter x Hunter (2011) exceeds all my expectations. I would recommend this series to anyone, especially a shounen fan because I think it's one of a very few anime that is truly remarkable, well-executed and very enjoyable. Watch it and you will understand why this anime deserves its rank.",10

                Hunter x Hunter has always been one of those anime that looks amateur or goofy at first hand. Yet, behind those innocent faces is a classic tale of an adventure. Hunter x Hunter is more just about becoming hunters and being the best at what they do. Rather, it’s a show about development with a cleverly written story wrapped with a colorful cast of diverse characters. For starters, Hunter x Hunter is a series that invites attention when it comes to storytelling. There are various arcs with characters that can easily be attached for their personalities, abilities, and most importantly…class. As Hunter x Hunter is
                  a shounen series, it’s also an anime that develops beyond just the typical “save the world”.
Adapted from the popular manga series written by Togashi, Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a remake of the original series. Now, it not only has more detailed animation quality but also expands on several arcs that never made itself debut on screen. 
The story tells about a young boy named Gon as he strives to become a professional hunter and find his Father. During his journey, he meets protagonists including Kurapika (a young boy with a dark past), Killua (an assassin from the infamous Zoldyck family), and Leorio (a fellow Hunter candidate hoping to make a career from his journey). Essentially, the series details Gon’s ambition to become a hunter. And to do that, they must go through the torturous Hunter Exam, a series of brutal tests that pushes the boundaries of survival and wit. While this also seems like good old fashioned fun, the series also expands beyond this and gets darker as well as more complex. The Yorknew Arc is a testament example of this as it takes on an unusually mature style of storytelling. The infamous Phantom Troupe (antagonists involved in the arc) serves as a driving factor to how dangerous the HxH world can truly be. Along with that, we also have Kurapika and his quest for revenge against the Troupe for what they’ve done in the past. What makes the show shine itself in this particular isn’t just by the growing more mature style of its presentation but by the driving factors. Surprising twists are revealed and the main characters gets intertwined in way that may change their lives forever. 
Similarly, the Chimera Ant arc also adapts into a more mature style of storytelling. What makes this arc stands out also is not just the typical shounen style battles. Instead, it cleverly crafts its antagonists (the Chimera Ants) including its leader, Mereum, the King. Several of the antagonists undergoes unique changes and their dynamics is reflected by development through relationship building. Most prominently, Mereum’s characterization blurs along the line between human and monster as his development is expanded by his interactions with a human girl. Additionally, Gon’s inner desires to avenge a friend reaches a peak in this arc that will change his character forever. Along with that, the arc is notorious for its violence as blood is spilled, heads flies off, and limbs are blown to pieces. In one triumphant moment, the series pulls off a stunning moment that leaves almost every character shocked and speechless in their words. Maybe you might get that reaction too. With cleverly constructed dialogues and character building, the Chimera Ant arc goes beyond just a fantasy trope of ‘invasive species taking over mankind’.
Characterization is important and it comes in all shapes and sizes. The first instance is Gon, an energetic young boy with a whole lot of potential. His friendly demeanor earns him many allies including the cold-hearted Killua. Fearless and putting others before himself, Gon’s true visage comes to his ability to keep a promise. Several instances in the series depicts him shooting for near impossible tasks. But it’s important to realize at the same time that Gon’s actions are not self-motivated but usually for others’ sake. On the other hand, Killua comes off as a socially awkward boy with a head of mischievous ideas. Even so, he is a talented assassin having being trained from an early age in the art by his family. His relationship with Gon is a driving factor as the two becomes similar to brothers. This is very evident during one of the arcs when Killua plays on a very big risk to save Gon from death by consulting with a dangerous individual. Also interesting to note is the very family relationships he has with others. Killua’s family is a group of assassins including his mother, father, and brothers. They treat him differently on individual basis as some sees him as the rightful heir of the Zoldyck name while others wants to control him. The most prominent relationship he has is perhaps with his older brother, Illumi, a talented assassin who has installed fear into the young boy. Throughout the series, it’s interesting to note how Killua deals with the inner struggles of that fear. He faces against powerful opponents such as the Phantom Troupe and Chimera Ants. Sometimes, it feels as if he is fighting against himself when he struggles with his psyche. Nonetheless, Killua’s family is more than just deadly as they held some influences on the young boy’s life.
Unfortunately, not everyone has a family anymore in this show. Kurapika is perhaps a tragic example of this as his clan was murdered. Seeking revenge against the Phantom Troupe, Kurapika’s desire to wipe them from the face of the earth goes to mind-breaking depths. Not only does he put himself in grave risk with his newfound abilities but also his friends as well. The way his character is depicted becomes something of an avenger as we witness how he matures from a professional hunter to a warrior seeking for redemption. As the final main character, Leorio plays more as a support to the team. His role is often overshadowed by the others. Yet, he is involved in several key moments throughout series that influenced deciding factors. I wouldn’t call his role in the show as useless or stale though. Think of it more as lacking the “It” factor. What this means is that while Leorio lacks moments that viewers will remember him by, his role in the show is noticeable when the push comes the shove. 
In essence, the antagonists of Hunter x Hunter may seem stereotypical. However, it’s easy to see that they can also be complex like a labyrinth. Characters such as Hisoka, Chrollo, and Mereum are prominent examples of this as their motives are often shrouded in mysteries. For instance, Hisoka (a serial killer and hunter) often plays life itself like is some kind of game. He always seeks out powerful opponents and hope that people like Gon would one day by strong enough to become a fruit to be “ripped. In certain ways, his role in the series can seem ambiguous as he sometimes tries to get in the way of the protagonists while other times assists them. In the end, it’s all fun and games to the man as he toys with other people’s lives for his own amusement. On the other hand, there are also antagonists that falls under a more stereotypical category such as the Bomber Trio during the Greed Island arc. Genthru, the leader of the trio, serves as an obstacle the protagonists must overcome. And as a sociopath, killing is no stranger in his vocabulary. 
Hunter x Hunter also likes to play more on mind games but in a more logical way through conversations rather than a typical mind rape trope you might see in some psychological series. The final arc of the series (Election Arc) serves as a way to convey how certain characters talk in their style to characterize themselves and stand out in order to get what they want. Pariston, the Rat Zodiac, is perhaps the most prominent character of this as we see his role. But to say the least, the series’ ability to command presence of this characters to the viewers is through its innovative concepts to adapt. Most of the characters in this arc are also shrouded in mystery. And through this background, viewers will become interested by the potentials they hold.
The series’ fantasy style comes with in a variety of ways. The lavish lands such as the forest of the Hunter exam or the RPG gaming environment of Greed Island arc are examples of this. Similarly, it can rebound and become more civilized like a more modern setting such as the streets of metropolis of Yorknew City. Nonetheless, the show achieves its purpose by its ability to comfortably shift between settings without going off track. Similarly, the series has a battle system with Nen. Divided into six categories and heavily explored in the Heaven’s Area arc, it follows this concept for the remainder of the series. It’s easily understandable too without getting viewers to scratch their heads because the Hunter x Hunter shows, not just tell. And by doing that, it leaves behind an impression to viewers to understand and appreciate Nen and its ways. 
Hunter x Hunter isn’t without flaws. While the series is more complex than meets the eye, there are moments when it feels painfully indulging to get through. The first arc (the Hunter exam) may seem slow and dragging at times. Leorio’s role in this arc may easily be forgettable while certain fights will be underwhelming. Certain characters may also be hard to take seriously throughout the course of the series and hard to understand. And while some of the antagonists may seem memorable, others can be a nuisance to get used to. This may even feature a few of the hunters in the show as their roles are diverged after their presence as compared to the main characters. Also noticeable is the repetitive OP song that never changes throughout the show. While this wouldn’t be a problem at first hand, it can feel less appealing. Similarly, the pacing of certain arcs can feel slow. In fact, it can be slow enough that some viewers may distance themselves from the show to come back to it later. In retrospect, it breaks apart the strong development into a weaker focus. Oh and while narration wasn’t a big problem for me throughout the series, certain viewers will find it distracting and needless as it drags out episodes; in particular the Chimera Ant arc. Nonetheless, this is a faithful adaptation of the manga so praise is definitely earned there. 
Madhouse is the brainchild behind the anime production qualities. While some parts may lack the classic feeling of the original series, the show’s quality improves by its visuals. Certain scenes are enhanced or remastered to improved quality while others are expanded. However, the backlash might be their lesser faithfulness to certain parts to the manga. Nonetheless though, the series’ quality improves as the show goes on. The character designs are also distinctive such as the case with Hisoka, members of the Phantom Troupe, and the Chimera Ants. Characters’ designs also become more mature and complex such as the case with Kurapika. And as mentioned previously, the show’s fantasy atmosphere is a like a breath of fresh air. Most welcoming of course.
Soundtrack is decent although some parts lack appropriateness in the beginning and some bits later on. For most parts of the series, the soundtrack is strong and balances well between the comedy and serious moments. Emotional OST is also used during certain episodes to evoke feelings such as during the Phantom Troupe and Chimera Ant arc. Certain theme songs also fits their arcs well for overall impression.  While the OP song remains the same throughout the entire course of the show, the ED song undergoes through various changes. Most of them have its dynamic setup and the ‘time to get it done’ feeling. Similarly enough, the voice mannerisms of the characters deserves its praise for their portrayal. Their voices not just serves as representation of their characters but also their personalities and development. With such a development, no wonder Hunter x Hunter is more than just a classy shounen.
The endgame of Hunter x Hunter is not just its battles. In fact, most of the battles aren’t very long or featured as the highlights (except in some cases in a few arcs). Rather, it’s by the structure of its well written story and unpredictable plot twists that will really suck you in for its delivery.  The characters are complex with a style that is unparalleled when it comes to characterization. Not only do the main characters get spotlights but certain antagonists will also be memorable for their roles and development. And with Madhouse being at the steering wheel, you can expect this show to be worth every minute of it.",9

                **This review will contain spoilers**
Hunter x Hunter (2011) is widely considered by many (along with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood) as the peak of action shounen anime and as what every action shounen anime should aspire to be, an opinion I can’t agree with since, to my eyes, it’s not really a completely well-functioning neither a fully satisfying show to begin with. Keep in mind that, obviously, this is only a perspective based on my own experience, as I can still see and understand the reasons why this is such a praised and beloved series by its fans.
I need to start this review with some clarification and
                  background. You’d be thinking after reading this that I’m no fan of Hunter x Hunter, but that isn’t the case. (I would definitely not be writing this lengthy review of a TV series if it didn’t mean much to me). Back in 2016, after reading somewhere else how this series was “so much better than Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood”, a series I had recently finished and liked, I felt naturally interested to know what the craze about this show about a boy with spiky hair, a green outfit and a fishing rod was about. I knew it had two versions, one from 1999 and one from 2011, but as a lover of the 90s cel-animation aesthetics (and because it had a dub in my own language), I felt inclined to start it with the older one. And it was love at first sight. It’s quite hard to describe with words, but never before I had felt with such intensity a true sense of immersion from the very start. Hunter x Hunter made me understand the true meaning of the word “hook”; I was to my surprise immediately and joyfully dragged into its world thanks to its enormously captivating, mysterious yet realistic nature and atmosphere and its irresistible somber feel, that made me want to genuinely follow this orphan kid in his quest venturing into the unknown, uncovering mysteries, facing all sort of obstacles and meeting friends and foes in his way. And by the time I finished the mind tests in Trick Tower, the feeling of amazement had become so intense that I knew this series had already become an instant all-time favorite. The original version of Hunter x Hunter gave me a watching experience of those you don’t find very often.
I didn’t honestly feel much of all this when starting later the 2011 remake version by Madhouse. I don’t want to sound like an annoying broken record here, but I really have to say that when it comes to the execution of the first four arcs, Nippon Animation’s 1999 adaptation is so immensely superior that it’s hard to understand how can anyone who has seen both of them believe otherwise. This is not just because of the grittier, bleaker art style and the more natural, earthier color palette and shading/lighting -both in characters and backgrounds- that mix together to create a delightfully sinister, realistic atmosphere that makes you feel you are not only a mere external TV watcher, but instead another character inside this wondrous yet wicked world joining the adventures of our cast, a feeling present since minute 1 that expresses at its fullest during the York City arc, where the city is not shown just as a mere setting, but instead as another omnipotent character lurking from the shadows enveloping the whole cast and narrative. It’s neither just because of the much more realistic characters' designs, nor the more mood-setting, emotion-stimulating music, that here is crafted with way more personality and is more than just BGM; it actually plays a key role in establishing the atmospheres, creating the moments and sucking the audience into the world. No, it is also -and mainly- because of the overall direction and this very meticulous, careful attention to small details which are the true responsible of fully submerging the viewer, capturing way better its desired sense of adventure and mystery, cleverly composing and joining together each scene, setting way better the desired moods for the right moments, keeping the viewer at the edge of his seat always wanting to know how the story would unfold, and ultimately bringing a vastly more exciting, warmer and memorable experience.
2011, on the other hand, is just not the same. There’s nothing technically wrong with its execution, but here I didn’t feel the same level of mind, heart and passion poured into its production that I did feel with 1999. For a lack of a better term, the best way I can describe it is that it just feels “okay-ish”. It lacks touch. It feels somewhat insipid. It just does what it has to do, with minimal effort required. Let’s do what we have to do quick so then we can go to party. The art doesn’t feel anything special, and the colors and lighting decisions don’t suit the overall dark, gloomy and realistic nature of the show (the colors are just excessively bright and the edges too clean to be able to create a more human, natural, relatable environment and the rough, outdoor sense of the show; instead, they make it feel more artificial, plastic-looking and videogame-ish. Nothing inherently wrong with this, but it’s just way less charming, haunting and inspiring!). Some of the characters' designs look too goofy for their own sake, especially Illumi, who in 2011 looks more like a ridiculous clown, whereas in 1999 looks actually like the menacing, merciless creepy murderer he is. Music is nowhere as full of personality, mood-stimulating as the one of the older version is and the tracks are barely memorable, some of them painfully generic (especially the boring drums and guitar riffs one, that doesn’t suit well with the tone of the series), though I have to admit that it improves a lot later during the 6th arc. (Although, when “Legend of the Martial Artist” is played like 2 times per episode, it eventually becomes tiring). But much more important than art and music, is the way the story is told, and especially during the Hunter Exam arc, where the differences are more noticeable. I can’t blame those who say that this arc was “nothing special” or “generic, boring shounen introduction”, because it’s precisely this okay-ish execution that makes it feel like that, as opposed to 1999 where it was a complete different story! The older version put much more attention into the introduction and build-up of both the world, the characters and their backstories, there you can see them interact more with each other and you can see how their relationships grow more smoothly, it does a much better job when it comes to establish a genuine sense of mystery and intrigue about what would happen later on and there are many scenes with nice attention to characters’ facial expressions, showing what are they feeling in regards to everything they are living, an approach that here adds a great sense of naturalism. The 2011 version just paled in comparison regarding this, which decided to speed things up by cutting many relevant moments in order to get to the unadapted content as soon as possible.
I initially wanted and I’d love to delve more into this matter by providing and describing concrete scene-by-scene examples, but considering that would have made this review insanely long, I had to dismiss the idea. Nevertheless, I think my point is clear, and these comparisons can be found with great detail in many other places for anyone interested. All I’m going to add here is that it saddens me the little love and attention Nippon Animation’s adaptation gets in comparison to Madhouse’s one, when it isn’t in any case inferior to it despite the latter going further in the story, much less for shallow reasons such as “because old animation”, “because newer version with higher resolution”, or because “it has fillers” (seriously, this idea that 1999 is “dragged by fillers” I don’t know where does it come from, when the filler count is a mere FIVE episodes and guess what: they are GREAT! Since not only they are actually well-integrated into the story, but also they enhance it: in particular, the additional bonus stage in the exam where the examinees have to cooperate together in order to make an abandoned battleship work to save themselves is very good since not only is highly enjoyable and one of the highlights of the arc, but also because it sets a nice contrast with the following test where they would have to hunt each other). Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to say here that 2011’s version of the earlier parts isn’t worth the watch, it’s just that the 1999 one is in a whole superior level, it’s something else, is way more enjoyable, is the one that understands that there’s a viewer outside the screen eager to live something memorable and the one I would recommend, even if unfinished.
But of course, putting stylistic and directing differences aside, substantially speaking on paper it’s 90% the same thing. Regarding the first four arcs (Hunter Exam – York City), it’s a competent show featuring a well-constructed, well-thought intriguing storyline that flows well from arc to arc, blending well the dark and lighthearted moments, and there’s hardly anything wrong to say about them apart from a somewhat anti-climactic ending for the York City arc that didn’t live up to its full potential, by leaving some things not concluded and postponed for later on. It also features a likeable and relatable, yet complex set of characters each with their own motivations, backstories and well-defined personalities that feel real and contrast nice with each other, with Killua being the most interesting of the bunch as he’s the most mysterious and layered one and rightfully so the one that “steals the show”. (There’s also this debate on whether Gon qualifies as a “typical shounen protagonist” or not, which I will not address here since, typical or not, he is a good character anyway). With the exception of ¼ of the main cast (Leorio), all of its members receive a fair share of attention and/or development at some point. The set of antagonists is also good with the Genei Ryodan/Phantom Troupe members being the highlight, who are more than just bad guys who want to do bad things because villains and feel real with good motivations, distinctive personalities and backstories as well. Finally, it features a complex power system (nen) that allows creative fighting (though there’s nothing inherently wrong with just power levels and brute strength, by the way). I don’t want to delve further here since all these elements have already been described better in other reviews.
However, by the time the 5th arc of the show -Greed Island- starts, where Gon and Killua would participate in a game Ging had created and would train their nen abilities, the first real problems arise when part of the “magic” is gone; the series starts to feel quite different by the introduction of a straight fantasy and scifi-ish vibe with the whole getting inside a video game phenomenon (even if later it’s explained that it wasn’t really that) which felt out-of-place when remembering the fairly realistic, natural setting and what I like to call a warm “wood and stone” vibe that had characterized the show so far and which caused the audience to feel a little uneasy. The fantasy elements of the show, which so far had been limited to just some special, quirky abilities of the nen users and some weird creatures in the beginning, are taken to an extreme here when nen starts becoming the excuse for all kinds of unimaginable situations to happen, like building up not only an entire island out of nowhere, but also its inhabitants (!), materializing from nowhere any type of object just by spelling its name, getting teleported and summoning an angel that would out of nowhere regenerate a body part. It was in this arc where it became evident that Hunter x Hunter didn’t have the intentions to keep its original concept the viewer had stuck its mind to and had invested its expectations. Nonetheless, these feelings of strangeness still lay within tolerable boundaries and were nowhere as strong as the ones the next arc in the series would give, an arc which in my opinion, consists in Hunter x Hunter’s fatal error, the lethal wound from which it would never recover and the main reason explaining its non-functioning condition.  
And here’s where I wanted to get. 
The Chimera Ants arc. The famous Chimera Ants arc. Regarded by many as the so-called “best arc in shounen anime”, the 6th and longest arc in the series is without a question the fan-favorite one, the one that explains most of its praise, and the reason why it places so high in anime online rankings. However, to my eyes (and fully aware I’m in the minority here) the story is quite the opposite: it’s actually the main reason why I think Hunter x Hunter (2011) is NOT really a series that works well, why it frustratingly disappoints and why I had to sadly withdraw from this Hunting party after seeing the direction it had taken. And this is not because “it drags on too long” or because of the “heavy, annoying use of narration”, which are the two most common criticisms people make towards it (and that to my eyes, are not problems at all), but rather because this arc…has absolutely nothing to do with anything that had been shown before. It’s a total momentum breaker, a complete deviation from the premise that had been developing so far, that established an annoying sense of discontinuity thanks to a sudden, unannounced change in focus, making the audience ask itself: “what is this? This is not what I was watching!”. This can be better seen and understood by making a recap of all the previous arcs. If we consider each arc of the series as a chapter of a book, this is, in brief, how the Hunter x Hunter story was progressing:
•	Chapter 1: A boy, motivated to find his dad that had abandoned him since birth, leaves his home and must complete a famous, dangerous exam as the 1st step, where he would also meet his first real friends. He passes it.
•	Chapter 2: After an unfortunate event towards the end of said exam, he goes to rescue from his wicked family one of those recently met friends, since he wants to be with him and wants him to join him in his journey. He succeeds.
•	Chapter 3: The two boys, now together, realize that, in order to be able to survive alone in their quest, they need money, so they go to a place where they think they can make a lot of it quickly. They make it, and then they decide to take a break and return to the boy’s home to rest a bit and evaluate what to do next, where, now with Hunter’s license in hand, they discover the next clue to find dad.
•	Chapter 4: The two boys travel to the city where they need to be at to find the next clue, and where also one of the other friends they met in the Hunter exam is going to solve his own issues.
•	Chapter 5: The two boys participate in a game that, if won, would put them one step closer of dad. They win it, which leads them to meet a close friend of him that could give them valuable information regarding his whereabouts and/or could give them hints regarding what to do next in their journey.
•	Chapter 6: The two boys instead, decide to join a mission to confront an invasion of overpowered beasts that threaten the world.
Huh? This “6th chapter” I’ve just described, as it can clearly be noticed, has little to just no relation with the five previous ones, and constitutes a drastic rupture in the flow of the story. In one minute, it is about a boy who was in his quest to find his father and in the next one, about the same boy and his best friend fighting and stopping from dominating the world powerful beasts that -narratively speaking- come out of nowhere. There is no natural continuity here; the arc is entirely a forced detour from the street in which the plot had been driving so far which hadn’t even been previously signaled at all (foreshadowing), inevitably catching the audience off-guard since there was just no way it could see it coming and getting prepared for it. In other words: the Chimera Ants arc simply pops-up in the middle of an unconcluded story, interrupting the natural flow of the show’s overall narrative, changing both its focus and vibe overnight and forcing the audience to now pay attention to something else completely unrelated to what it had invested both its interest and time in. It almost feels like the magical card Gon uses at the end of Greed Island arc teleports us to an entire different show! No offense to anyone here, but it really makes me wonder if all those who didn’t have any problem with this were actually caring about the story they were watching or not.
It doesn’t help the fact that the transition to its development is not even credible (in which case its inclusion would have been at least more acceptable). Gon and Killua, since the ants issue clearly wasn’t something related to their dad-finding quest and wasn’t any type of “next stage” he had prepared for him like the Greed Island game was, never had any believable reasons to join Kite’s biological investigation and to get involved in it from the beginning, even more when considering that it’s not as if anyone had asked or obliged them to do so or they never really had an option. After spending 75 episodes worth of sacrifice, pain and struggle, facing and overcoming all sort of complicated obstacles to find his dad… why would exactly Gon after all this, have any real intentions to embark himself into another different mission that just never had anything to do with him (and dragging Killua in the process, since he just follows him anywhere he goes) and was not going to help him to fulfill his initial real objective? His attitude made no sense, and his curious voluntary decision to join Kite’s team was nothing but an artifice on the part of the author to build the (artificial) bridge among arcs he needed to be able to now develop a story that had nothing to do with anything he had written before. (Of course, it’s not as if Gon’s sudden change of priorities couldn’t be possible, it’s just that, for narrative purposes, and from an audience standpoint, it was not believable). And it is precisely this lack of a believable or justifiable link between the motivations of the protagonists and the recently emerged biological threat which gives the audience few to no reasons to feel genuinely interested in it, much less when it had been already interested in another conflict/thread beforehand that hadn’t even been concluded yet. If there are no reasons why our protagonists should be caring about this biological anomaly, the new characters it introduces and their stories, then why the audience should?
Some people argue that this isn’t really an issue because there was never a “main story” in Hunter x Hunter to begin with, that it was instead always just “Gon and friends exploring the world”; a collection of stories with different purposes and tones with the protagonists as the only constants, and that this arc was just one of the many different quests, a statement I fully disagree with. Hunter x Hunter was never about random adventuring. Here we had a clear, well-defined goal from the start. Moreover (and unlike some other battle shounens), the protagonist was actually and actively doing actions for the achievement of that goal since day 1. It was this goal the common thread that was unifying all the previous arcs. How can it be said then that there was never any overarching story? There was a clear direction here, and the Chimera Ants arc opted to deviate from it. Others say that Gon didn’t dismiss his search for dad, and just decided to follow Kite because he was well-respected by him. This could be true, but we as an audience, we expected him to continue with what he had been doing so far because we were invested in THAT struggle, yet the show, in the form of Gon’s decision, asked us to now be invested in something else and to forget for a (not precisely short) moment of the main reasons we were following the show. The whole arc then for these reasons felt ultimately like a gigantic filler arc, except that it wasn’t! It’s quite funny and curious to notice how the arc that was sold as the “main dish” or the “main attraction” of the series, and the one the fanbase favorites the most, actually was the one with the least amount of relevance and that least had to do with its premise! 
But what was really wrong with this? Why is it really bothering? Not only because of the continuity break and sudden focus-change I mentioned earlier, but in reality because the “DNA” of the show is suddenly artificially mutated into something else here. In concrete terms, with the forced inclusion of this arc, Hunter x Hunter is transformed (at least the way I see it) into what it never really was: a straight battle shounen about fighters and fights. Gon and Killua are now these full-time, “badass” super-warriors with cool superpowers that feel the duty to stop evil creatures from doing damage to the world, and Hunter x Hunter, once a series about a boy in his quest to find his dad, is now a series about fighting powerful enemies and saving the Earth. 
Like…seriously. Is this the reason why the audience signs up for in the beginning of the show when it knows nothing about it? Does the audience expect to watch another Dragon Ball Z with large-scale battles, powerful enemies that threaten the world and warriors who confront them when it’s watching the first arcs, when it was all about fairly normal people living adventures and trying to accomplish simple, mundane goals? I don’t think so. The C.A. arc makes Hunter x Hunter feel like a completely different series from what it had been and it is both disappointing and unsettling to notice. And while it’s true that the show had featured some (scattered) fights earlier, the show wasn’t really about them, they were never the focus, and all of them were still “down-to-earth” (this is: no “over 9000” stuff) and were actually linked to the motivations and purposes of the main cast; they represented real obstacles the protagonists had to face in order to meet their goals and/or to move to the next stage. And that can’t be said about the nature of the fights in C.A. arc. Hunter x Hunter was not a show about fighting and defeating powerful enemies that appear in the way. It never suggested to be so, despite having a power system, because Gon and Killua were never the cool shounen super-warriors owning powerful enemies after training and getting stronger. Yes, they were special, quicker and stronger than average people, but just that, they were still two normal boys the audience could always relate to since they were never depicted as shounen heroes who were going to take down the enemy in turn with world-domination or destruction purposes, but rather as people that could have been your simple, next door friends. Unfortunately, that sweet sense of relatability was totally lost here, where they were both turned into unrecognizable super-warriors having their badass “super saiyan” shounen moments (I know technically they aren’t that, but it’s still how they feel) and the down-to-earth feel of the series was lost too. It was quite a shame and a displeasure to see how a series that had given the impression of being just about fairly normal boys going in adventures, uncovering mysteries, facing and overcoming challenges in their quest to achieve clear personal goals, betrayed its audience when it suddenly replaced its adventurous nature by a straight battle shounen setting, feel and structure, despite having promised something else in the beginning.
You’d be thinking after reading all this that I have nothing good to say about the C.A. arc, but that’s not the case. It can’t be denied that the arc has the most ambitious writing of all, is morally complex and features thought-provoking ideas by exploring well the themes of the relationship between human beings, animals and their coexistence, the man vs the beast, the food chain and what does it mean to be a “perfect being” that will rule every species, among others. Also that it features a well-written main antagonist and that it shows interesting character development for both sides (though, it’s a shame how we finally got some great development for Gon during a conflict that had a filler-feel attached to it), all of these elements that certainly add value in a story. However, in line with the aforementioned continuity issue, the only way all of these elements can materialize their value is if they belong to something that feels to the audience relevant to begin with and/or contribute in a significant way to the main story of the series, which isn’t the case here when remembering there was never a natural transition to the arc, so they become -as harsh as it sounds- useless. No matter how dark and deep it wants to be, if it is something unrelated to the core of the series, there’s little reason the audience should care about all those themes. It’s hard to do it when the arc is structurally flawed since it doesn’t fit or can’t be connected in an organic way with all the previous ones. Besides, it doesn’t help that all of these themes have actually more relation to the character of Meruem instead of Gon. In fact, it can be seriously said that the main character of this arc is in reality Meruem than Gon. Why should then said themes matter much when they have little relation to the motivations of the main cast of the series? Themes alone are not enough to carry a narrative if the events surrounding them have little relation to it. 
In the end, what I’m trying to say here is that it’s not that the arc is bad on itself, it’s that it reduces the overall value of the whole show when joined with what had been developed before, because it makes it not work in the long run. (It’s the complete opposite to a synergy; making a mathematical analogy here, let’s call the value of the first 75 episodes (A) as V(A) and the value of the chimera ants arc (B) as V(B), what we have here is that the value of the combination, V(A+B), is less than the value of the sum of the parts: V(A+B) < V(A) + V(B)). Despite some issues, the C.A. arc is an interesting arc, but only when thinking of it as a separated, stand-alone entity from the earlier parts of the series. I can’t help but thinking that it would have been much better had it been part of another series where it could have fit more.
Speaking about issues, the arc isn’t exactly free of some of them that, while not (that) severe, they certainly don’t help its cause and make it hard to consider a perfect one like the fanbase claims. For the sake of not making this review longer than what it already is, I’ll just list some of them, without going into much detail (and no, the slow pacing and the narrator aren’t part of them).
•	It made 50% of the main cast be nowhere to be found for 50% of the whole show (it’s curious how other shounens are criticized for leaving relevant characters behind, yet Hunter x Hunter for some reason is excused for doing the same!), which is not something irrelevant narratively speaking. Kurapika and Leorio deserved better.
•	Some of the “ants” had plain ludicrous, laughable aspects, which made it difficult to take the arc as seriously as it wanted to be taken.
•	The Gyro episode was totally useless, since he never becomes a relevant character later on, as well as those dedicated to showcase an uninteresting fight between some minor ants and some Phantom Troupe members, who were by force crammed in the story just so it could be said “hey, see? We haven’t forgotten about them!”.
•	Why would the Hunter Association let two inexperienced kids help them to get rid of the ants instead of asking more experienced hunters do the risky, difficult job? 
•	How did the ant queen get there and why is she larger than the “normal” chimera ants shown in the first episode by the lake? There is little explanation as to how these creatures came to be, which would have been appreciated.
•	Also how the ants were able to retain part of the memories of the human beings from which they were created was too unrealistic. What’s inherited were genes, and memories have nothing to do with them. 
•	The character of Komugi is presented as a plot device to show development for Meruem. She wasn’t ever really important.
•	Part of Gon’s development is rather acting out-of-character when he threatened to murder an innocent blind girl he knew had nothing to do with Pitou. 
•	Some highly dramatic and serious moments were partially ruined with bad comedy in the form of Pouf’s eccentric, effeminate behavior, in particular during the king’s recovery process. That was... just bad.
•	I really don’t have a problem with this, but I do have a problem when I see how other shounens are criticized for the inclusion of the so-called “power of friendship”, but Hunter x Hunter is curiously not when it does exactly the same thing when we see how Killua could remove the needle his brother implanted in his head thanks to…remembering his friendship with Gon. So no, it’s not like Hunter x Hunter completely avoids any type of emotion-based solution. 
•	Some people contend that Gon having an anger burst for Kite leading to his transformation was questionable since they hadn’t spent that much time together to develop enough feelings for him. I don’t agree with this, since Kite had always been an important figure to him, but I do agree that it would have certainly been much better and impactful had the murdered figure been someone more important to him like Killua or even Ging (had the case been he met him after G.I. arc).
•	Finally, and the one I consider the worst one, Kite “reviving” into a little girl was plain dumb, and this only served to drastically diminish the emotional impact of Gon’s said transformation scene shown only 5 episodes earlier. Now it turns out that Gon had lost his shit for someone that hadn’t ever really died! (at least, not his soul). Narratively speaking is anti-climactic.
Moving to the last arc of the show, where the Hunter Association has to discuss how to elect its new chairman, Killua once again has to solve some family issues and Gon is magically recovered by a more sophisticated version of the dragon balls (literally), Chairman Election arc is a very disappointing way to conclude the series because not only it deals with the consequences of the Chimera Ants arc; it also suffers from them. Its most obvious unfortunate result is that yes, Gon finally meets his goal of finding dad, but not thanks to his own efforts, but rather thanks to fortune; Ging would not have gone to the celebration of the election at the Association had Netero not died and Netero would not have died if the ants had not shown up. In other words, because of the Chimera Ants arc, the show misses the opportunity of a more intriguing goal-resolution and a well-earned final prize for Gon. He finds him thanks to circumstances that didn’t depend on him. Why announcing the quest of finding Ging as a puzzle if at the end the puzzle never had to be solved? What was the point then? Moreover, it doesn’t help that the way the long-awaited first meeting occurs is not as inspiring as it should have been, considering it was the reason of the audience's investment in the show and all of Gon’s hard work. The crucial moment, instead of being treated dramatically and seriously, is treated very lightly with unfitting comedy, funny faces and funny music for no reason, like it hadn’t ever been serious business. Pretty underwhelming way to show the most important moment of the whole series.
I can’t see Hunter x Hunter (2011) as a fully satisfying show, much less the peak of shounen anime. Not when it fails to deliver what it had promised in the beginning and suffers from severe continuity problems both in vibe (starting in Greed Island arc) and later also in focus (in Chimera Ants arc), that turn it ultimately into a troubled, deformed show where the audience doesn’t know what it’s watching anymore and feels confused regarding what it wants to be or do. I can’t help but thinking it would have been much better had it stuck to what it set out to do from the start and had it kept its initial focus instead of straying from it (with not even a natural, believable transition) with the inclusion of the Chimera Ants arc that made it not work in the long run. Why couldn’t it just follow the path it had clearly established, with a story related to the objectives of any member of the main cast? What was really the need to depart from it? If the answer is adding more maturity, thought-provoking ideas and showing more development to Gon and Killua, there were better ways to do so with a continuation actually linked to the premise, with for example a more complex next stage in their mission to find Ging that would have been much more interesting and rewarding, instead of massively shifting the attention into a story that for the protagonists' purposes was just a side-quest with fillerish-feel and little relation to the driver of the narrative.
As someone who found very good and enjoyed the earlier parts of the series (especially in its first 1999 adaptation), was deeply immersed in its story, characters and world and was obviously very interested to know how it would keep unfolding and end, I badly wanted to like Hunter x Hunter (2011) and join this party, but unfortunately that couldn’t be the case for all the reasons I’ve explained. It’s not a straight bad series at all, but -despite understanding the reasons why it enjoys such a good reputation among the fans- it also isn’t something I would easily recommend to anyone, nor call the “best action shounen of all”, a distinction I’d contend either version of the Fullmetal Alchemist series enjoys (and this even when neither of them is my all-time personal favorite), which, unlike Hunter x Hunter (2011), are both of them fully well-functioning and satisfying in their own ways. 6/10.",6

                Hunter x Hunter could be described as a revolutionary and unorthodox anime in the sense that it is unpredictable, cunning and intelligent, especially when comparing it to other popular shōnen such as One Piece, Bleach or Naruto. It is a tale which seems to start off as a simple battle shōnen, yet escalates into an unforeseeable development that delves deep into human psychology, death and hope, in addition to being composed of one of the greatest cast of well fleshed out villains, which is very rare to see in the genre itself. It is a must watch for anyone who is acquainted to the medium.
                  It is a show that can arguably boast of having the best arcs presented in shonens, which is an achievement on its own. With that being said, it naturally has its flaws as well which will be illustrated below in addition to its numerous strengths.
~Story~
The premise of Hunter x Hunter is simple in nature, the twelve-year-old Gon Freecs setting out to find his father, who abandoned him as a child to become a Hunter. Trying to understand why his own father abandoned him because of his profession Gon chooses to become one in order to find his father. It is a profession riddled with danger, ranging from tasks such as researching species, capturing criminals, searching for treasures or exploring the unknown. What however makes this anime outstanding is the journey it undertakes towards its conclusion, as many have pointed out, with a compelling narrative and fleshed out characters, fantastic soundtrack and animation. It is an adventure enveloped in friendships and encounters with the likes of Killua, Kurapika and Leorio, in addition to countless hardships and the search of what it actually means to be a hunter, an exploration of oneself.
The narrative is the strongest point of the anime, carrying a powerful analysis of humanity and several messages:  to not group people into categories such as evil or good, friendship and the appreciation of the little things in life. Exposition wise, there is an external narrator at times, which explains in more detail several situations, as well as the characters thoughts, which for some may be a drawback. It presents itself with various types of situations seen in other anime such as tournaments, card battles, thriller and psychological ones throughout its duration, which in some cases don't blend in well with the narrative and the atmosphere. In a way, this breaks the immersion in the story as it often  The story is structured into seven arcs, some huge, some magnificent, others arguably lackluster in comparison. Viewers may observe a progression into a darker atmosphere, whilst maintaining its moments of cheerfulness. Some of these arc are however far from perfect: plot holes, illogical actions, and plot convenient situations happen as well, together with some progression issues. Nevertheless, these could be easily overlooked as these were intriguing, full of suspense and were unpredictable; these can be brutal, where death and mayhem is present.
The pacing of the narrative is overall well done, hardly ever having stretched or rushed scenes, although later on it is apparent that some episodes were affected by these to accommodate the battle intense animation scenes. This affects mostly some episodes in the Chimera Ant arc. The first batch of episodes are mainly dedicated to the introduction of different characters and their respective goals, as well as slowly giving the viewer an image of how the world of Hunter x Hunter might be shaped. Furthermore, as story progresses, more is shown, which is actually quite interesting, as it is pretty unconventional. Being based on current human civilization with all the different flavours within, the flora is much more exotic, with huge trees, which could be said about the fauna as well. Audiences may attribute it to the likes of Dragon Ball in its variety. In addition, there are many places inaccessible for the common folk, only restricted to hunters due to the dangers within that region, which creates a lot potential for the author to work with.
As mentioned earlier, as the story develops, it begins displaying the different things in the world, such as the introduction of ""Nen"", social structure, a great variety of characters including villains, the different political factions within the Hunter Association and naturally, the adventure of the protagonists. However, when the anime begins to explore the psychological aspect, it is where it shines: it dedicates itself  to the analysis of humanity and their nature as a species, as well as themes as cynicism and hope, whilst increasing the characterisation of its cast. These aspect are conveyed through the representation of dictatorship (which audiences may see some similarities to that of N.Korea), political discrepancies among hunters and the government, you name it. The author manages to portray said elements thoroughly, in addition to showing viewers the true beauty of nature and its infinite potential. Through the characters and their evolution, egoism, individuality, selflessness, loyalty and love are portrayed. It also exposes both ally and foe at their best and worst, enhancing the overall experience of the show.
Finally, another important aspect to consider is the battles that are executed alongside the story and its respective techniques and exploration. These are wonderfully relayed to the viewer, being well paced, intense and unpredictable. Another positive aspect is that said abilities are obtained through rigorous training (comparing it to other shōnens), which nearly eliminates the occurrence of power ups and ""asspulls"". What comes as a surprise however is that the main protagonists are susceptible to defeat, and are not the necessarily the strongest characters in the anime. In fact, the protagonists experience defeat on numerous occasions, creating much more tension when the fighting starts. Nen is also introduced in the anime, which could be considered a superpower to the likes of Chakra or Devil Fruits, or the famous Ki from Dragon Ball. 
What makes Nen interesting is the endless variety within. What however stands out, which in turn makes Hunter x Hunter somewhat unique, is that the battles are not solely dependent on raw power: intellectual cunning is heavily relied on. It ultimately proposes what true strength really means: power? Intelligence? Speaking of Nen and power ups, the anime sadly suffers some issues, affecting in particular some rules introduced with regards to Nen and its abilities, which was a rather big drawback. This was especially the case when the story was nearing its conclusion, having managed to create an atmosphere where stakes were high, Nen could suddenly be used to obtain ridiculous amount of power, leaving audiences thinking why all the other characters (antagonists in particular) didn't do the same.
~Characters~
The story of Hunter x Hunter wouldn't be as well crafted without its numerous characters. First of all, let me begin by mentioning that even though they may come over as typical archetypes, these are well-developed characters, especially the main protagonists. Another thing to note is the fact that most characters are susceptible to death, although positive, sometimes is not well executed. This is the case when some characters are introduced, only to shortly afterwards die without any character progression whatsoever, leaving viewers most of the time indifferent. Maybe another thing to note is the fact that the female cast takes a background position: males are of importance.
The characters that undergo most character development are definitely Gon and Killua. Gon has a cheerful and positive personality, in addition to being egotistical, yet it is clear that he is smart as well; characterised by the use of his fishing rod, he uses strategies that are tied to this, such as sneak attacks, hit and run, you name it, which is quite unconventional. As the story progresses, viewers observe how he grows and get to know his values and personality, seeing his deep affection with life and that of his friends. This deep-rooted loyalty to his friends causes him to cast aside his humanity in one instance. As for Killua, he could be considered the most interesting character, as he undergoes the biggest character development in the whole show. He has a dark past, entangled with his family: he knows no love, nor friendship, he only knows superficial joy. It is apparent that throughout the series he begins to see the bright side of life, in particular that of unconditional friendship, especially during the Chimera arc, where he plays a central role.
The exploration of other characters such as Leorio or Kurapika are very weak in comparison. A lot of potentiallly interesting characters are relaid to the viewers, yet most of them are left unexplored, or are either forgotten. There are several chaarcters that stand out, yet one should be mentioned, and that is Netero, which no one could ever forget. A cheerful old man, yet very strong, both in his conviction and skills, who lives to acquire the ultimate power. Other characters of interest are Knuckle, seen as a typical ""delinquent"" of the 90's as well as Morel McCarnthy. The Zoldyck family is certainly of interest as well, as these are composed of a great variety of interesting characters, and will play important roles in the events to come.
Where the anime really shines character wise is in its villains. The villains as a whole can be described as varied, with motives and values. Almost every single one of them is fantastically fleshed out, caring for their companions, which is so rare to see in shōnen counterparts. As mentioned earlier, the anime proposes to not categorise people into evil or good, which can be appreciated through the phantom troupe, which may seem at first as remorseless killers. This is however clearly visible are the chimera ants, as these may seem ""evil"" for humanity, yet these only act according to nature, which in turn draws parallels with how humans treat other species. In addition, the story often focuses on these characters, rather than the main protagonists who at times take supporting roles, carefully showing the viewer their personalities, as well as developing them through the numerous situations and own struggles with their beliefs. This is especially apparent in both the Yorkshin and Chimera Ant arcs. Villains of note are: Hisoka, the crazy battle hungry clown, the phantom troupe and its respective members, as well as the numerous members of the chimera ants.
~Animation and sound~ 
While the characters design can be seen as childish and may be a drawback for some, it has a great distinctive cast of characters, which is a huge bonus. This is in addition to the different unimportant characters that have distinctive designs as well. It must be mentioned that some character's design is lacking, in the sense that those are nearly exact copies of iconic characters such as Cell from Dragon Ball. Speaking of animation, it is done by the studio Madhouse. It is very fluid, in addition to its combat scenes, as well as correctly conveying the emotional states of the characters through detailed facial expressions. Backgrounds are well drawn and varied, often befitting of the setting.
The voice actors performed their roles well, easily conveying the personalities of each different character. What however stands out is its soundtrack, which is varied and suited the atmosphere it is trying to portray: drums, electric guitar, simple sounds, orchestra, there is really a lot of variety. It must be noted that some of these are either overused or wrongly implemented in some situations.
~Enjoyment~
Hunter x Hunter was overall a fantastic experience, with its gripping storyline, characters and soundtracks. Although the story was very gripping, it also had its share of flaws, and some big ones at that, especially when nearing its conclusion. The interactions with the cast are smart and never dragged out either. Furthermore, it is interesting to see how many of its ideas were implemented later on in series such as Naruto for example. Nevertheless, the well paced narrative, well fleshed out villains and its unorthodox approach to its execution, alongside with its psychological aspects, make it easily one of the most entertaining shōnens out there, which in turn made it very easy to watch a lot of episodes in a session. Hunter x Hunter is highly recommended to anyone who likes shōnens. At face value it seems like it's targeted to younger audiences, yet the underlying depth to the characters/story will only be appreciated by older audiences.
Thank you for reading.

                Firstly , I cannot forgive the god-awful character designs in this show , these ugly characters are the reason as to why Itachi went blind . I mean how do they expect us to take this show seriously with these awful designs , It was also one of the main reasons I hated the Chimera Ant Arc because it allowed Togashi to roam free with his ugly ass seizure-induced drawing.
Another thing is the art style , I found the 1999 version to be more mature , whereas the 2011 adaptation looks cutesy and childish for my taste , another reason I can't take it seriously.
The
                  only good , enjoyable and watchable arc is the Yorknew City Arc , all the other arcs are ass
Gon's abilities are also boring , predictable and lack any sort of possible development
This anime only has a couple of good characters ( Killua , Hisoka , Feitan , Machi and Leorio) the rest suck ass
Feitan and Machi are also the only good phantom troupe members , the rest are boring and lack and depth. I mean even the cut from the blade Kurapika put on Uvogin's heart had more depth than them
The Hunter Exam Arc is a boring and bootleg version of the Chuunin Exams ,and I'm not the only one who agrees with that , there is plot convenience all over the goddamn place , how can a Fat shit like Tonpa and a skinny shit like Leorio run 80+ km it makes no goddamn sense.The only good thing to look forward to in this arc is Killua and Hisoka 
When Gon and gang went to save Killua , I was interested because I thought something interesting was gonna go down but no , Togashi just pulls conveniences out of his ass left and right , I was facepalming every episode , so much so that my face has my full hand-print . You mean to tell me that a 12 year old kid with a broken arm , which magically got healed thanks to the power of plot , a 17 year old and lanky malnourished boy in a suit managed to individually  put 1209 kg worth of force into opening the door they were struggling to carry a 20kg cup. If you ask me , PLOTTTT!!!!. The soundtrack in this arc made by ears burn and there was also absolutely no suspense , I mean I had a higher chance of finding Gon's hairline , than I did of finding any suspense in this arc.
The Heavens Arena Arc also sucked ass because there is no balance between whether this is a training arc or tournament arc . The idea for heaven's arena was alright but it turned shit , As expected. Now , the only thing AND I MEAN THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT THIS ARC was Hisoka and his fight with Kastro , they truely displayed the power and potential of , they should've also gotten rid of those 3 nen users Gon and Killua were fighting. 
The OST's are decent , especially Hisoka's and Kurapika's (Kusari Yarou)
The Greed Island Arc has to be the most sleep-inducing arc , I had to take meth , coffee and adderall to stay awake , It cured my brother of insomnia , he watched 1 episode and he was dozing off. If it hadn't been for the dodgeball game I probably would've dropped the arc there , it is completely pointless even Gon said it himself , the card-gathering moment was extremely unbearable to watch especially since it served no purpose at the end. The bomber is also the worst written villain and he also should've killed Gon but no Gon was saved by OH WAIT , ITS A BIRD , ITS A PLANE , NO , It was the god awful plot convenience from the unexplained cards
Now , Onto the most overrated arc ever , The Chimera Ant Arc (CAA)
The CAA has to be the most overrated arc ever to be made , the only good thing about this arc was killua and feitan , this arc was also incredibly dragged out it probably could've only been 30 episodes had they not put money first
The idea of Chimera Ants also makes no sense , since they're suppose to hold more than 2 different genes but none of them look even remotely like ants and they somehow in an isolated nation happen to have so much resources and it also makes no sense how the latter generation (Pitou , Youpi , Meruem and Pouf) were so strong compared to the previous generation (Welfin , Meleoron etc) when there was nothing that happened inbetween their births to contribute their increase in power , people use eating Pokkle as an excuse but when Pitou was born Pokkle was alive
This arc tries so hard to be dark and mature but fails in every way , Gon's transformation against Pitou was an asspull and also made no sense as he only knew Kite for 2 weeks yet he was crying like a bitch and we were all supposed to like that hell no. 
Netero vs Meruem was also a bad fight , it was just Netero slapping Meruem and Meruem getting back up and talking about some Gungi bullshit yet people suck off this arc. The narrator is especially annoying I mean that guy had more lines than the actual fucking VA's 
Meruem is also the worst villain , he has no personality , he is just the cliche ""I want to rule the world for the sake of it"" villain , he also has no special techniques and he is incredibly strong which made no sense and in the end he became good guy , yep like that has not been done before.
Now , I actually liked Nen as a power system because it was really balanced . but then Alluka shows up and the word 'balanced' is thrown out of the window , Alluka is a living deus ex machina that can grant any wish but somehow wasn't used in the CAA because Killua doesn't want to abuse her which is completely contradictory.
This show also has the worst reunion if I've ever seen it , Ging just shows up in front Gon , which is annoying because what purpose do the previous arcs serve.",1

                I never gave Hunter x Hunter more than a passing glance previously. The large episode count, uninteresting story description, and silly looking character designs put me off from watching the show. However, after finally taking the plunge into this series after being given a recommendation, I’m so glad that I watched it. I would have missed out on a true gem of an anime otherwise. 
The anime follows the story of Gon Freecs, a twelve year old boy who decides to take the challenging and highly dangerous Hunter Exam in order to become a Hunter. Those who pass the exam receive a Hunter License which
                  gives the owner special privileges and status. Gon’s personal goal for clearing the exam is not to get all of the superficial perks of being a Hunter but to be able to someday reunite with his father, who is a Hunter and left Gon at a young age. On his journey, Gon meets both friends and foes and faces various challenges. The story, admittedly, does not sound especially enticing. However, Gon’s journey is filled with twists and turns and often betrays expectations in the best of ways. I found that events often did not play out as I would have expected, but the way they unfolded felt very natural and well written. 
The anime covers seven story arcs, with a trend of an alternation between serious arcs and lighter, more training oriented arcs. The story is one of the strongest points of the show; the writing at the show’s worst is better than that of other shows at their best. One of the later arcs in the show is noticeably darker than the rest and is one of my favorites with regard to story and writing, touching on a variety of themes and ideas that provide some good food for thought. As a side note, the heavy narration during this particular arc seems to be a point of contention among fans; I personally found it to be an interesting method of storytelling, but I could understand why some would not enjoy it. I found the fight scenes of Hunter x Hunter to be another exceptionally notable point regarding the quality of writing. Rarely are fights based around just brute force strength and visuals. Instead, the fights are incredibly enjoyable because of the complex strategies employed by those who are in combat. 
The main characters of the show are Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio. Gon is upbeat and cheerful with a strong sense of determination, and Killua acts as sort of a foil to Gon, being generally positive while staying more grounded to reality than Gon. Kurapika is an intelligent youth who is out for revenge against those who committed atrocities against his clan, and Leorio is the silly yet charismatic guy, serving as comic relief at times. Of these characters, Gon and Killua, being those that receive the most screen time, get the most character development. Killua, through his friendship with and experiences with Gon, opens up and becomes a less cold individual. Gon has some interesting character development in the latter part of the show, as he begins to face situations that his boundless determination and optimism cannot fix. 
The villains in this show are great, with personalities ranging from calm and collected to quite insane, and I would say that they are more interesting than the protagonists. They are hardly what I would call generic, for the most part, and have distinctive characteristics which make them intriguing characters to follow. The villains are also presented in a way that makes them feel like true threats to the protagonists rather than simple obstacles in the story.
The art and animation in Hunter x Hunter is nothing short of phenomenal. Madhouse did an excellent job with this show; the animation is fluid, especially during fights, and the art is crisp and beautiful. The fact that this high standard of quality is kept throughout the entire show is especially admirable. The actual character designs might not be appealing to some, but looking past that it is hard to deny the quality of this show on a visual level. If nothing else, this show is a treat for the eyes. 
I have less praise for the music. The sound track is decent overall, with some excellent orchestral tracks in the mix. However, I felt that some tracks were used far too often to the point where I would occasionally get irritated by some of the music. I feel that an increase in the variety of music used would have benefited the show. Also, the opening theme, featuring two sets of lyrics, is the same throughout the entire show. Departure is a good song, but I think it would have been nice to have different songs for the different arcs. The upbeat nature of the opening doesn’t quite suit the tone of the darker arcs in the show. 
I wouldn’t call this show perfect, but it does so many things so well throughout its 148 episode run with nary a drop in overall quality that I cannot help but be amazed.  If you feel hesitant about starting this show because of the art, length, or other petty matter as I was, consider giving it a chance. Keep an open mind, and you might find yourself liking it much more than you expected, as I did.",10

                ""Gon, you are light... sometimes, you shine so brightly I must look away. But even so, is it still okay if I stay by your side?""
--- Killua
This is my second review, so I'm still figuring out the ropes - if you haven't seen Hunter X Hunter 2011, I hope this helps push you toward watching it! And if you have seen it, I hope this helps fill in the void left by the series' ending. As many know, HxH 2011 ended two days ago, and even now, I still kinda tear up when thinking about it. I chose the above quote because I very much
                  feel that way toward HxH 2011 - it's an utterly brilliant anime that is sometime too great for its own good, but in the end, I would have given anything to keep watching it - to stay by its side.
I came late to the HxH scene - when I first heard of HxH, I was in a depressive slump in the Fall of 2013, and the series was in the middle of its sixth arc (the Chimera Ant Arc). Hiding from my friends, I was kinda looking for something to just fill my time - what I found in HxH 2011 ended up blowing me away - it lifted me up, restored my faith in myself and in other things, and it helped carry me to where I am now. I can safely say that HxH 2011 has been the most influential anime I've ever seen, and it count myself extremely blessed that I discovered it when I did.
For the sake of this review, I'll be going through each of the categories, explaining my scores for each one, and then concluding with my final thoughts.
Story: 9
The HxH story is EPIC. While I normally hate that word, I can't think of a better adjective for what HxH achieves. The story spans seven completed arcs (the eighth is currently in the works and manga-only), and it covers every possible story type. From romance to drama to intrigue to espionage to politics to adventure to horror to suspense to simply relishing in the power of undeniable friendship, HxH 2011 has something for everyone. The first arc (Hunter Exam Arc) is more exploratory in nature, as it sets the stage for the HxH world and introduces us to the characters. The second arc (Zoldyck Family Arc) really starts to bring the characters to life, as you get to see more into their personalities and hearts, and the third arc (Heavens Arena Arc) ups the stakes and lets us fall even more in love with the characters. The fourth arc (Yorknew City Arc) takes a much darker turn and helps us see the HxH world from a drastically different perspective, and the fifth arc (Greed Island Arc) introduces new plot elements while expounding on the characters even more. The sixth arc gets even darker as it introduces a menace unlike any the HxH world has seen before, but admittedly, this is where some pacing issues come into play. The seventh arc also is a lot slower than the previous arcs, but it is where a lot of the intrigue and politics come into play (albeit, this is why the seventh arc is a lot more serious and seemingly “dull” than other arcs, although I found it fascinating as a political science major). The eighth arc has yet to be adapted to anime, and actually, HxH 2011 ended before they could explore it. Altogether, the story does a wonderful job of keeping you interested and engaged (I only gave it a “9” instead of a “10” because of pacing issues that appear in later arcs), and it leads directly into the next category…
Character: 10
If you noticed I kept saying the word “character” during my “Story” segment, that’s because arguably, HxH 2011 shines most when it comes to its diverse and incredibly-well fleshed-out characters. From the naïve and determined Gon, to the sinister yet sincere Killua, to the blunt yet considerate Leorio, to the vicious but kind Kurapika, each and every one of the main cast is amazingly well-developed and irritably loveable. And this is not to say that each of the main characters is perfect – if anything, it’s their imperfections that drive them to such great heights.
Gon isn’t your typical anime protagonist: while he IS headstrong and innocent, he has a fantastic strategic mind, and… he gets his butt kicked. A lot. While some have complained about this, I feel that it lends strength to Gon’s character as a whole. While he is phenomenally talented, he keeps finding himself pitted against similarly-talented opponents with vastly more experience than himself. And so, realistically, he wins some, and loses a bunch more. But that gives him an aura of realism. He’s not your typical hyper-powered Shonen character that always manages to win on pure willpower alone. Instead, he’s great (yes), a genius (definitely), amazingly skilled (indeed), but also realistic. And this makes you care about him. When he goes into a fight, you can’t be sure whether he’ll emerge unscathed, or even if he’ll emerge at all. You worry for him, and as you watch him try his best to do his best, you root for him earnestly and with complete genuineness. What’s even better about him, though, is his attitude. He’s always positive, even in the face of defeat, and he always tries to learn from his mistakes. I actually started watching HxH with my younger, 7-year-old brother, since he’s prone to fits of anger and resentment, so I figured it would be good to have Gon as a role model for my brother. And sure enough, my brother constantly felt uplifted by Gon – he was always saying things like “He’s so happy. He’s really happy. I wish I was like him. He’s so great.” You can’t help but fall in love with Gon, and as he adventures through the HxH world, you feel that you’re right alongside him.
Killua is amazing as well. He has a viciously dark past, and he tends to lapse into wrong/morally questionable tendencies, and that’s also what gives him a realistic edge. He earnestly seeks to be better, and partly, he wants to atone for the wrongdoings he’s done by serving alongside Gon. As such, we get to watch him traverse through the HxH as he discovers himself, discovers what it means to truly live, discovers what it means to have friends, and discovers how to care deeply for others. Plus, whenever he does one of his cat faces, your heart can’t help but melt (you have to watch the show to know what I mean, haha). So by the time you reach Episode 147, you truly feel the show has ended then and there. I won’t spoil anything, I promise, but even though the anime ended on Episode 148, Episode 147 was the true ending in my mind.
Leorio and Kurapika unfortunately receive less screen-time than Gon and Killua as HxH progress further on into its story. But the screen-time they do get in the first four arcs is magnificent, and it causes you to fall in love with them too. Leorio comes across as oafish and selfish, but he has a completely different side to him that makes the soft side of you cry every time you think about it. And Kurapika comes across as single-minded, but he’s one of the most grounded and well-intentioned characters in the series.
But HxH’s outstanding characters don’t just end with the four main characters. Indeed, it’s amazing how fleshed out almost all of the series’ characters are – you come to truly care for all of them. From Hanzo to Beans, from to Biscuit to Goreinu, from Kite to Knov and Knuckle and Morel and Palm and Shoot, from Wing to Netero, from Cheadle to Pariston, from Pokkle to Satoz, etc. – HxH very much distinguishes itself from other anime by having a tremendous cast of well-defined characters. And this isn’t even mentioning the Ants and the Phantom Troupe and Zoldycks and the Butlers and the Mafia and the Greed Island Players and the Heavens Arena Contestants and the Hunters… and you’d think that with all these characters, it would be easy to lose track of some. And admittedly, HxH does to some extent. It’s inevitable, really. But aside from the very few that fall between the cracks, HxH manages to paint realistic portraits for all of its characters – to the point where even if you don’t love them, you still are rooting for them and are vested in them and want to see them succeed and do well.
And this extends even to the villains. Never before in anime have I become attached (in some form or another) to almost EVERY SINGLE villain in the show. From the Phantom Troupe to Hisoka (who is possibly my favorite character in the show) to Meruem (another one of my favorite characters), you come to care about the villains so much that you laugh with them, feel shocked with them, and even cry with them. When Meruem’s story concluded in the sixth arc and the anime moved on, I was moved to tears at the thought of leaving behind such an incredible character, even though he was the “bad guy”. And oh goodness, Hisoka is amazing. Just watch the show. He’s fantastic. Trust me. A little weird, yes, but aren’t we all in some form or another? And his villainous side is so… unique… that I became instantly fascinated with him.
I could go on about the characters for forever, but at risk of a never-ending review, I’ll push on to the next category…
Art: 10
There is never a single lazy moment in HxH 2011 animation. All of the artwork pops with detail and care and love and diligence. All of the animations are fluid and minutely detailed, all of the characters are distinctive and eye-catching, and all of the vistas are breathtaking and invoke a sense of wonder. Even during episodes that are less action-packed, HxH routinely avoids flashback and pointless/useless filler animation, and it constantly takes the time to intricately lay out a vivid display of visual goodness. Indeed, the artwork is so smooth and amazing and engaging that I’ve come to set a new standard for anime art.
Sound: 10
The sound in is fantastic. Every visual effect is accompanied by an equally dazzling audio effect, the music is dynamic and invocative, and the ending songs are all great. Some may look at the fact that HxH 2011 uses a single opening song for all 148 episodes as a negative thing, but I like to see it as a huge positive – I came to fall in love with the song “Departure”, and now, “Departure” and “Hunter X Hunter” are indistinguishable my mind. If anything, I gave the sound an “8” because while it’s amazing, it doesn’t really stick out in my mind as much as “art” and “story” and “characters” do for HxH 2011. And admittedly, 148 episodes in, it would have been nice to hear a few new tracks added to the HxH  2011 OST. But again, this is a very minor nitpick with an otherwise fantastic score and audio effect reel.
Furthermore, all of the voice acting is terrific as well. All of the main characters are wonderfully voiced, and all of the supporting characters are just as well cast. Indeed, I can’t really think of any voices that were out of place or not well done. The voice acting is just that good.
Enjoyment: 10
As I’ve said in the beginning and throughout my review, HxH 2011 is a rollercoaster of feels and thrills. It introduces you to a magnificent world, lines up a host of enjoyable and realistic characters, and then lets you explore it from the pretty to the gritty. No expense is spared in this phenomenal anime, no corners are cut, no cop-outs are taken. And even better, the show does a great job of showing you instead of telling you, although this later lapses in the sixth arc (although it probably would have been impossible to do that arc justice without the telling it gives you, due to the intricate nature of that arc). You get to see and experience and discover the world through the eyes of characters you love and can relate to, and you get to have a blast while doing so. What more could you ask for from an anime? Or rather, what more could you ask for from such a wonderful adventure?
Overall: 10
Ultimately, you’ve probably heard a lot of hype about Hunter X Hunter 2011 – almost too much hype, probably. And often times, such hype can easily paint a picture of something that’s too good to be true. And if you’ve read this review to the end, then you’ve gotten another massive dose of hype. So instead of reading/hearing more hype, do yourself a favor by ignoring it all and instead finding out firsthand. Go watch the first few episodes Hunter X Hunter 2011. It starts a tad slow, but it quickly builds up, and soon, you probably won’t be able to stop watching. I made it through sixty-some episodes in a few days – once I started, I couldn’t stop. It was that good.
Why is it so good? Because HxH truly cares. It cares about its characters, it cares about its story, it cares about its world, and it cares about its viewers. It doesn’t string you along, or set you up for some cheap storytelling tricks, or waste your time. It stays to the point, it does its best to deliver a wonderful tale of courage and adventure, and stays true to itself throughout the whole experience. For that’s what HxH 2011 genuinely is – an experience. It’s not something that be truly summed up in words alone – it’s something that must be seen and heard and felt firsthand with Gon, Killua, Leorio, and Kurapika.
So go watch Hunter X Hunter 2011. I promise you, by the time you conclude your journey – your adventure – you’ll be glad you did so. And you’ll wish you could stay by its side for just a little while longer… :)
As for me, I’m gonna go grab some tissues and cry… it’ll probably be another decade before we get more HxH…   :(",10

                Hunter x Hunter is the most overrated anime series I've ever watched. I've never seen a fanbase more toxic and elitist than Hunter x Hunter fans. All of these people just constantly praise this anime and talk about how well written it is, but in reality that isn't true. In reality this is just another garbage battle shounen series like the rest of them. It isn't complex, it isn't well written at all, it's nothing but complete and utter dog shit.
Hunter x Hunter is about a kid named Gon Freecs that becomes a Hunter and wants to find his dad someday. This is the worst
                  story I've ever seen in a Shounen anime. I'll be explaining why I say this later on in this review
Hunter x Hunter has one thing going for it, the Yorknew Arc. Every other arc in this show was complete and utter garbage and I'll explain why. First we have the Hunter Exam arc. This was just a pathetic version of the Chunin Exams. It just feels way too slow and boring. This was the first arc in the series and it just failed to get me attached to any of the characters. There was just no reason to like any of these characters at all. Gon was the typical generic shounen protagonist. Killua was the typical edgy kid. Kurapika was the cliche revenge character. The only character that was interesting was Leorio. All of the trials in this arc were boring to watch and that's pretty much it. The mini tournament was also uninteresting/boring
Next we have the Zoldyck Family arc. Ahh what a waste of time. I actually thought something big would happen in this arc, but this unfortunately wasn't the case. They just go into the mansion and then get Killua and then leave. This arc should've been longer and actually gave more depth to Killua's family, but it didn't! In the end I didn't give a single shit about his family and any other character involved in this arc. And as usual, we get that stupid friendship/nakama bullshit in this arc. This is why I say that Hunter x Hunter is nothing different from the typical shounen, because it still has that nakama bullshit.
Heaven's Arena was just so boring it nearly made me fall asleep multiple times. Togashi actually made an interesting concept for an arc, but then completely ruins it. He ruins it by making the whole arc a damn training arc. This just doesn't make sense to me. This arc was way too focused on training instead of the actual fucking Heavens Arena. This is one of my biggest problems with Hunter x Hunter in general. This series just has way too much training and less story to it. None of the villains were interesting at all. They were just the typical cliche villains you'd see in any Shounen. The fights were complete and utter garbage. It's funny how they spend so much time training yet when Gon finally fights Hisoka it's nothing but hand to hand combat for the most part. So much training yet he doesn't even know how to use real techniques. Infact he doesn't even know how to use real techniques until like fucking 60 episodes!
Next is the Yorknew arc. a very good arc. Almost everything about this arc was actually phenomenal, but there are some problems. Firstly, the main two characters are so fucking annoying I just couldn't stand it. Uvogin was a very generic character and just not interesting to me. The rest of the phantom troupe all lacked any depth to them so I just didn't find them to be good villains. The best thing about this arc was Kurapika and his character development. Kurapika is the only character in Hunter x Hunter with good development. The rest of the main characters are complete and utter garbage with no redeeming qualities. Also the fight between Uvogin and Kurapika was pretty cool. 
Greed Island is one of the most pointless and boring arcs I've seen in a Shounen. Once again this arc is filled with boring training that nobody gives a shit about. Togashi made an interesting concept for an arc just to ruin it by making it a training arc. He just doesn't know how to balance things out and this arc is the perfect example. Them collecting cards was painfully boring to watch. The card system wasn't explained in detail so that was boring. We don't know what any of these cards are or do, so I got bored with all the card collecting bullshit. The main villain has got to be the one of the worst villains I've seen in a Shounen series. No depth whatsoever. He's just the typical one dimensional villain that's evil just for the sake of being evil. See it's funny how Hunter x Hunter fans talk about how well written this anime is, but I just don't see it! Characters like Genthru clearly contradict that statmement, and there's no debating about this. The fights in this arc were really bad. Gon vs Genthru was filled with plot armor it was just laughable. He should've easily lost that fight, but he just wins because of 100% plot armor. Greed Island could've been a good arc but it was ruined by many things. Bad villains, boring training, and barely any explanation to the card system. The world of Greed Island had 0 detail, none whatsoever. This just feels like a filler arc overall. One of the worst arcs in Shounen.
The Chimera Ant arc has got to be the most overrated Shounen arc I've ever seen. This is the most boring arc I've ever watched in an anime. The first 20 episodes of it were extremely slow paced and dragged on WAY too long. There was just far too much underdeveloped characters getting screen time so it was just ridiculous. The narration was the worst part about this arc. It completely ruined this arc in many ways. Firstly, the narration happened in some of the most important parts in the arc. When they where raiding the palace I just completely lost interest because of the fucking narration. This man was narrating for almost the entire episode it was just ridiculous. The fact that there needs to be narration in order to have people understand what's happening is just stupid. Firstly, it's an insult to the viewers. It's like they think the viewers are too stupid to understand what's going on, so there needs to be narration all the time. That's the impression I'm getting from this. Secondly, there's a lot of Shounen out there that don't need narration to tell a good story. 
Now when it comes to fights, this arc had some of the most overrated fights I've ever seen. First we have Gon vs Neferpitou. Gon gets a random asspull powerup and beats the shit out of her. It was really fucking stupid to see Gon so mad about what happened to Kite anyways. He barely even fucking knew him yet he's crying like a bitch when he dies. This just made no sense whatsoever, and this was just bad writing at its finest. He only knew him for two weeks and he went ape shit when he found out what happened to him. This was just pathetic writing. Next overrated fight, Meruem vs Netero. Imagine hyping up a villain for 50 episodes just for him to have no cool techniques or anything. His fight with Netero was so boring. He just gets smacked away and flies right back at him. The only good thing about this fight was the animation. Everything else was complete and utter garbage as expected.
It's funny to me how this anime tried to have strategic battles in its early stages. Later on it just becames the typical battle shounen with power levels. Gon vs Hisoka and Gon vs Genthru had some strategy, but Meruem vs Netero was a terrible fight and was just about who has the higher power level. There's no good reason why Meruem is that strong either. He has no techniques or anything. That's why that fight was complete trash.
Now lets talk about the battle system in Hunter x Hunter. The battle system is actually pretty good. Togashi puts so much detail into the battle system, but there is a problem here. The problem is that a shit ton of fights in which the battle system doesn't even fucking matter! Like why put so much detail into the power system when the fights just end up being the typical shounen fights! Meruem vs Netero is the perfect example of this. This fight was just another typical DBZ type of fight you see in anime. All I'm saying is, if you're going to spend so much time putting detail into the power system, at least make it important in every fight.
Rememeber how I said Hunter x Hunter had the worst story I've ever seen in a Shounen? I'll explain why I said that right now. Gons goal was finding his dad right? SPOILER: After the death of Netero, everyone Hunter has to attend the election. This is when Gon meets his dad....This is the most garbage thing I have ever seen. After all those arcs trying to find clues to know his dads whereabouts, this is how they meet. What was the point in Yorknew? What was the point in Greed Island? This was the most unsatisfying thing I've ever seen in an anime. After all that hard work, Gon ends up meeting Gnig in the stupidest fucking way possible.
Speaking about the Election arc, this arc was complete trash. The only interesting thing about it was Leorio and what he said about Ging. Everything else was bad. Alluka was a terrible character. She was just a living plot device and that's all there was to this character. Nothing about this arc was good and that's all there is to it.
Now lets talk about the characters. There's only one good character in Hunter x Hunter, and that would be Kurapika. He's the only character with interesting character development. Gons character development was complete trash, specifically talking about when (spoiler) kite died. THat was just awful development. Killua had some development, but I disliked him due to his constant change in personalities. One second he's the typical 12 year old, the next second he's edgy as hell. His character development is very basic aswell. Leorio could've been a good character, but unfortunately he was neglected for like 90% of the anime. It pisses me off how the only decent characters barely got any screen time at all. Meruem is incredibly overrated. He's just the typical ""I want to rule the world"" type of villain. His character development was very basic and nothing special at all. His development is pretty much him becoming more of a good guy due to Komugis influence. Oh wow, a villain that becomes a good guy... wow that's such great writing isn't it.... -_- I've seen character development like his in a lot of anime, so I don't get why people suck him off so hard. Overall, Hunter x Hunter has bad characters.
Hunter x Hunter has terrible art. Not only in the manga, but in the anime aswell. This anime has some of the most ugly character designs I've seen in a shounen. There's just way too many ugly looking characters it just looks so childish. There's nothing interesting about the music or animation either. The music was very unmemorable to me, and the animation isn't anything special.
Overall this anime was horrible. The only enjoyable arc in this anime was the Yorknew arc and that's it. Everything else about this anime was boring and painful to watch. I don't recommend watching this anime. There's just so much other anime to watch that are much better. If you're looking for a badass shounen with awesome fights and great characters, go watch Yu Yu Hakusho. They were both written by the same mangaka, but at least Yu Yu Hakusho is enjoyable to watch. The Dark Tournament and Chapter Black arc are both better than anything I've seen in Hunter x Hunter.",1

                This review should help people who don’t know yet if they should watch this series or not. It shall give you a small insight to the series and shouldn’t spoil you in any way. 
What is Hunter x Hunter(2011)?
So Hunter x Hunter is a series which is not really new. In fact the anime series had its debut already in 1999. The HunterxHunter(2011) anime series is simply a restart/remake of the 1999 series by MadHouse and is being extended by three arcs. 
Since both series adapt the same manga they have somewhat the same content. 
But let me tell you, HxH is not your average
                  shounen series you might expect. I’ll tell more to this later on. 
Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio; these are the names of the protagonists you’ll meet in the beginning. In the world of HxH people seek to become a hunter to get more rights, a higher reputation and power. The first arc features these four and shows the hardships of becoming a hunter.  The first three episodes mark a slow start but steadily the series gains the pacing it follows for the rest of the series. In total HxH has 7 animated arcs. 
With each arc we get to know a new set of protagonists and see many different actions taking place at the same time. So Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio are not the only characters you get to see, in fact you might not see some of them for several arcs. That’s typical for the HxH franchise and what makes it interesting.  
I’ve heard from many people things like “it’s not about kids fighting or some bullshit like this, right?” Don’t be confused. On many promotion posters you see covers of Gon etc. and yes, they are kids but this will not bother you. The development of each character throughout the series is remarkable and you will hardly notice that there are actually kids. You will only be reminded of this fact by watching the fighting scenes where their inferiority to the adults is displayed. It’s often shown that Gon and Killua are skilled and strong but they are just kids and lack the power and experience adults have.
It says “shounen” series, so can I expect that friendship and effort are needed to achieve your goal? Do I get to see some kids fighting and half-hearted action fights? Nope. It’s true through friendship and a lot of effort the goal can be achieved but the fights in HxH are exceptional and well thought. Personally I think the series has a pretty slow start. The first 26-30 episodes should be seen as some kind of long intro. We get to see a lot of action taking place in these early episodes but this is hardly what HxH consists of. 
If I were to describe the tone of the series in the beginning I’d say it’s somewhat bright. The tone changes later on extremely and the series gets darker. Especially after episode 36 we get to know the cruelty and darkness of the society. Don’t think you will not see heads, limbs or blood flying around. This is what HxH truly consists of. 
In many other shounen series we see protagonists fighting and winning the fight through friendship values or who has the bigger muscles. But in HxH we actually witness the hard training Gon and Killua for example have to go through to achieve their goal. The fact that they are kids is indeed some kind of handicap for them. They can’t be stronger or have more experience than adults. But this doesn’t restrain them in any way. Bigger muscles or more power are not needed, fights in HxH are often won through technique and knowledge. There are a lot of characters who are actually stronger and more skilled than the protagonists. Gon for example knows that he has no chance against his opponent but he keeps going on and comes up with a plan to defeat his enemy. This is something that you sadly don’t often see nowadays in shounen series. 
I would even go so far as to say that HxH defines the point of the shounen genre anew which as been forgotten in last years. 
But let me tell you HxH doesn’t only consists of action, the comedy deserves its own section. With Gon we have the usually simple- but also broad-minded shounen protagonist. He has a somewhat childish character that is often displayed in the comedy scenes. Killua on the other hand is the one who acts more like a grown-up of the duo. Killua as a descendant of an assassin family is more skilled and acts more reasonable. He actually is the one who comes up with the plan and acts like the brain of the group. There are often some quarrels between both of them which helps to refresh the situation. The comedy scenes always have the right timing and leave you at least with a smirk. 
So what can I say to the music? Without naming anyone I can say the music is another forte of HxH. Throughout the 148 episodes MadHouse used the same opening with different visuals though. The ending changed for each arc and there are some good songs among them. The sound composer has done a good job on conveying the situation by using some epic OSTs. 
I should have mentioned this way earlier but I hope some of you are still reading this. So what’s up with the animation? MadHouse had in the last seasons a rise in well-known anime series. The animation is high quality as to be expected of the studio. The character concept got a full revamp: slightly new designs and new voice actors (compared to 1999 version).  Personally I am someone who despises the use of the CGI technique. If it’s not needed it’s not needed. But you hardly get to see any CGI textures or movements in the series. As to be expected of nowadays series, HxH has well-animated effects, surrounding designs etc. The fighting scenes as I said before are what make HxH unique. You can almost see how much love the animators put in the fighting movements. In many series you get to see the, I’d would name it, “rubber-effect” where the movements start to melt and you just see some wobbly characters moving (as in Naruto). This is not the case in HxH though. 
One last thing I’d like to mention would be the Nen system. Without spoiling anything, everything that is happening in HxH can be explained through Nen which is a power almost every human can gain through training. This complex system is another forte of HxH and shows how much thought the mangaka has put into his work.
Throughout the review I’ve mentioned some other series for comparing. I didn’t intend to criticize them in any way. Every series has its weaknesses and strong points. 
Conclusion:
Well, that’s what I think of this series. Hunter x Hunter is a series worth of its rating and should be seen as something that could be on par with the top 5.  To be honest I’ve seen many people not watching this series because of the length (148 episodes). Yes, it is long but worth the trip. You will soon get absorbed by the atmosphere it emits and will enter a totally new world you will surely fell in love with. Trust me you will not regret your decision.

                Hunter x Hunter is one of the best anime I've seen. It's my first time writing a review, so it probably will be super disjointed.
To be honest, the art style put me off from watching it, because it's not what I usually like. But, every other aspect of the anime made up for it. After watching a few episodes, I got used to the art and started to like it.
Story: 10
Even though it's a super long anime with 148 episodes, the storyline was always full of surprises. There is a mixture of action, emotion and romance. One moment I was crying, and then the next
                  moment I was filled with tension. This anime contains aspects from all kinds of genres.
Art: 8
Like I said, the art isn't really what I prefer when I watch anime. But, I came to like it after watching a couple of episodes. There are times when the characters look cute; there are times when they look super duper scary. But, overall, the art is quite likeable and I quickly adjusted.
Sound: 10
The sound was absolutely amazing. I really liked the OP and even set it as my alarm- it has this really refreshing and powerful feeling. The sound effects throughout the anime was really varied, and I mean this in a good way. Every single scene in the anime was supported by the perfect background music, and this made the storyline even more powerful. But most of all, the sound when people were hurt or killed was really scary. I've lost track of the number of times I cringed from the sound. Basically, the sound really did an excellent job in supporting the anime.
Character: 9
Some of you might be thinking, WHAT? How can you not give a 10 for this section?! Certainly, each and every character deserves a 10+++++ rating. Whether the character was good or bad, I found myself becoming emotionally attached to every single one of them.
Oops this might be a spoiler.. Like Knuckle would say, ""Each and every one of them had a good heart.""
If someone asked me to pick my favourite character, I don't think I'd be able to. It's just that hard to make a decision.
The reason why I give character a 9, rather than a 10, is because of Gon. There's no doubt he is a super amazing protagonist. However, so many aspects of the anime made me overestimate him. Every time I thought he'd do something great and heroic, he didn't quite live up to what I expected. This probably sounds like a selfish judgement, but it's true.
Enjoyment: 10
No doubt about it. I watched 148 episodes in around a week. If that doesn't explain it, then what will? I enjoyed every single bit of the anime.
Overall: 10
Hunter x Hunter (2011) is the best~~",10
"
                148 episodes is a lot of time to invest in a series..Only a good series can justify that much time..And HunterxHunter not only justified it,but it basically blew away any pre concieved notions i had about it...Before starting this anime,i was really skeptical mainly due to the lack of mainstream hype..Surely if it was THAT good,it should have recieved more attention,right?I couldn't have been more wrong..HxH is without a doubt one of the greatest animes I've seen and after finishing it i'm left with a deep sense of loss..Anway,here's the more detailed review:
Story:
10/10
The story is mainly about Gon and his journey to find his father..His
                   friends Killua, Kurapika and Leorio and the three protagonists besides Gon.. There were hardly any filler episodes as far i remember..Once I started watching,I couldnt stop till the arc was complete..The story picks up pace at the correct intervals while slowing down whenever necessary to add character depth..There were no plot holes and all ends were nicely tied up at the end of each arc leaving me with a sense of satisfaction
Art:
8/10
For me  the art was very good...It wasnt the best I've seen but it was nonetheless pleasing on the eye...The fight scenes in particular made a big impression on me..So 8/10 for the Art
Sound:9/10
The OST was superb with tracks like 'To Give a Marionette Life'' and ''Hyori Ittai'' really adding a lot of emotional depth to the scenes ..the music was one of the best I've heard in recent years(bettered only by Attack on Titan)..So it gets a 10/10 from me
The Voice acting for the four main actors was very good..But what really surpirsed me was that some of the best voice acting performances came from the side characters like Knov during his breakdown..There were no voices that seemed out of character and i found the voice acting in total to be very good..So it gets a 9/10 from me
Overall Sound gets a 9/10
Character:
10/10
The large number of episodes certainly helped in building character depth to the characters...And by that i mean not just the main characters...Plenty of side characters like Shoot,Razor,Knov,Pouf,Bisky etc got important  minutes which made it easier to understand their motivations and their subsequent reactions to various situations..In fact I'd go so far as to say the characters and  the build up given to them is probably the best I've seen in anime...A definite 10/10 from me
Enjoyed:From start to finish i enjoyed every second of it..A 10/10
Overall:HxH is quite simply one of the best animes I've seen..I decided to watch even though i had some doubts about its quality..But it completely blew me away and i look back on it as time well spent..A truly great anime and a must watch for every anime fan.",10

                Hunter x Hunter 2011 is no ordinary Shounen by any stretch. It's one with very few Shounen tropes or cliches, one that is both refreshing, dark, as well as deep. It's essentially a Sienen disguised as a Shounen. Do not let the childish look or the fairly mediocre plot description turn you away from this anime, because it really does deceive you. You do not want to miss this masterpiece, it's something every veteran or newbie anime fan should watch at some point.
Story: 10/10
What really separates Hunter x Hunter from other Shounen is the fact that every arc is completely unique and different in almost
                  every way. They also flow right into each other naturally despite being so different. The writing of Hunter x Hunter is consistently brilliant with very few flaws and tends to be very intelligent, making the viewer question things as if this were a physiological anime. Hunter x Hunter also has the two best anime arcs of all time as far as I am concerned. Those who have seen it know which arcs I mean.
Art: 9/10
The art style is fantastic but obviously gives off an initial childish look, the animation is excellent. You will notice some episodes are given much more attention in the art and animation department but even those that get less attention, they are still fantastic, and when you get to one of those episodes where more attention is given to the art and animation you will definitely be impressed. 
Sound: 10/10
The soundtrack starts off well but gets much much better over the course of the series and has some absolutely superb OST's. Hunter x Hunter 2011's soundtrack is definitely my favorite soundtrack of any anime and I've seen hundreds of anime so that's quite a feat.
Characters: 10/10
Along with the story, the characters are the two best components of Hunter x Hunter. There is a HUGE cast of very rich and extremely well developed characters, none of whom are copies of each other and are very unique and have their own attributes, interests and traits about them. The main characters, Gon, Killua, Leorio, and Kurapika all develop a huge amount over the course of the series which was an absolute trill to see how each of them developed. The villains are also all very deep for the most part, apart from one who isn't bad by any means but just not on the level of the others. Let me just say that Hunter x Hunter has some of the best villains of any anime.  
Enjoyment: 10/10
I never once felt bored or tired of watching and was able to go on some seriously long binge watching sessions before I caught up at the time episode 137 was airing. From that point on every Tuesday was like a birthday with Hunter x Hunter as my present. An absolute joy to watch from beginning to end. It does start off a little slow in the first two episodes, but from then on it picks up the pace and only gets better and better.
Overall: 10/10
Hunter x Hunter 2011 is the absolute king of Shounen anime, there is nothing better, and is my favorite anime of all time. This is one anime you can't miss. After reading this review you should be opening a new tab and watching it straight away because THIS is a masterpiece.",10

                THIS WILL SURELY BE THE LONGEST AND MOST IN DEPTH REVIEW I HAVE EVER DONE.
Forgive me as I try to collect my thoughts and review this epic masterpiece of an anime.  As tears rolled down my face during the final episode's conclusion, I realized HunterxHunter's true greatness.  The way the series drew me in with its endearing cast, and brought me on a roller coaster thrill ride for 148 episodes was me experiencing something truly pure and un-replicated in the medium.  That is not to say it's without its flaws, but the overall reward from HxH is something gratifying and magnificent. And
                  of course, there are spoilers to be had here. 
I will admit, when I first went into HxH I had a fair amount of hype because Yu Yu Hakusho was my favorite battle anime ever made.  I just loved the constant growth Yusuke underwent during the franchise's 100 plus episodes.  The similarities in writing from Togashi are clearly present, but they do nothing to detract from the uniqueness HxH possesses.  Oddly enough, with such a staggering amount of episodes, HxH contains virtually zero filler.  Instead, the series is delicately divided into 6 independent arcs, which all  focus on completely different methods of storytelling ranging from the suspense thriller Yorknew City arc to the dark and defeating Chimera Ant arc.  The series literally touches on everything: politics, humanity, tournaments, failure and video games.  Perhaps even more impressive is that it manages to do all of this without ruining itself with unneeded romance or fanservice.  
Sure, I will be the first to agree that HxH does not have a strong start.  The Hunter Exam arc is actually my least favorite in the entire show, but that's not to say it wasn't necessary.  Togashi uses this arc as a way to develop ties to the main characters and establish its roots.  It also gives an introduction to one of the most unpredictable characters in anime history, Hisoka. I wouldn't say I was necessarily bored with the beginning of the series, but it wasn't something I was binge-watching straight through. I stuck it out in part due to my love for Yu Yu Hakusho and for the respect I had for my friend's recommendations.  The positives of this arc are the necessary character developments and diversity in events within the exam itself.  Also, the first time Hisoka went on a killing rampage, I knew this wasn't any ordinary kid's shounen.  The negatives would be the pacing and how Killua didn't recognize Illumi's needles while he was posing as Gittarackur.  Illumi's reveal shouldn't have come as such a surprise when it occurred.  When Killua's composure snapped, it again reinforced the actual target audience for HxH.  The way Togashi can border innocent and playful dialogue with such sinister and bloodthirsty themes is eloquent to say the least. 
The Zoldyck and Heaven's Arena arcs are probably the closest thing HxH has to filler, but again, these arcs are an integral part to progressing the story and introducing both Killua's past and the life energy many of the skilled fighters have in the series... also known as Nen.  I almost feel like Togashi used the tournament avenue to introduce Nen out of need to fill his Hakusho void.  As many remember, the Dark Tournament arc from Yu Yu Hakusho was hands down the greatest tournament style arc in anime history.  I understand that climbing the steep ladders of the heaven's arena wasn't necessarily the focus of the arc, but I would've liked to see a little more fighting that would've transpired later in the tower.  It was also requisite to invite the viewers to peer into the secluded life of our assassin MC, Killua.  This introduction intrigued me, and made me even curious as to how Killua would eventually face his brother again after the Hunter Exam.  As the show went on, I was slightly disappointed that Gon and Killua's Nen instructor and apprenticed never reappeared, but other than Bisky mentioning him in the Greed Island arc, their paths just didn't cross.
Next came one of my favorite arcs of all time... The Phantom Rouge or Troupe arc.  Finally, we were able to understand the seething rage Kurapika endured from having to recount the loss of his family and tribe due to those notorious, ravenous killers.  This arc is also the point at which the show really begins to pick up.  I was ecstatic to see massive character development in Kurapika's case, and also to see Gon and Killua take on more of a supportive role. I remember the scene when the Troupe heads into the auction hall and obliterates everything in sight, my jaw dropped to the floor.  HxH's writing surpassed a level I didn't believe was even possible in a facade of a kiddy shounen.  Not to sound morbid, but I was transfixed.  Enthralled by just how much I was starting to enjoy the series' variety, and ho Togashi wasn't afraid to transport it away from a stereotypical shounen.  I kept thinking, “how do more people not talk about this show?” What unfolded in the next 20-30 episodes kept my finger trigger happy on the skip button as I couldn't get to the next episode fast enough.  The fight scenes in this arc, although fewer than I hoped, were entirely cerebral and constantly shocked me.  In particular the battle between the ten dons and how effortlessly and grotesquely the paralyzed Uvogin dispatched them.  I couldn't believe I was still watching the same show.  
Despite my immediate attraction to the Phantom Troupe arc, I still had a few small issues with it.  In a self-centered “perfect” world, I would've liked to see the arc taken further.  Once Chrollo's Nen was stifled, the arc was basically over.  I've never been a fan of plot conveniences, and it almost seemed as though Togashi got bored with one idea and meandered towards a new one.  Needless to say, the fight between the Zoldycks and Chrollo was brief but intense.  I would've also liked to have seen Nobunaga and Franklin in an actual one on one fight to fully explore their abilities.  The majority of the Troupe just feel like abandoned characters.  However, this might facilitate itself as a necessary evil in a series was such an enormous cast as HxH has.  Also, Hisoka never gets his rocks off by being able to battle Chrollo, the entire reason he falsely represented himself as a member of the Troupe in the first place.  This was another notch in Hiskoka's complexity however, since it's sometimes hard to pinpoint his alignment or rationale.
The Greed Island arc was more than likely my favorite behind the Chimera Ant and Troupe arcs.  There was something about it I was fond of.  Maybe it was the small break it had in the tense action of the preceding Troupe arc, or the sense of discovery or exploration it contained.  As an avid gamer,  appreciated the subtle nods it contained to the MMO world, and this added yet another notch on HxH's belt of variety.  I quite enjoyed the introduction of Bisky, although her true ability and past is not fully explored.  I believe she saw a part of herself in Gon and Killua, and took it upon herself to provide them with the highest quality training she could in the short time available.  I did have an issue with the villain of the arc, The Bomber.  Not only is he improperly developed, I found it very hard to believe he was as strong as Togashi alluded to.  And if that was the case, couldn't Bisky have disposed of him with ease?  At any rate, the Greed Island arc was a nice break from the intensity of the previous arc, and a qualified precursor to the series' longest arc.
The Chimera Ant arc's greatness is constantly debated among HxH fans.  On one hand, it explores humanity, self-identification and features some of the most cerebral battles of any anime I've come across.  On the other, there are some severe pacing issues and blatant disregard for some major role-playing characters.  I personally enjoyed the arc, but I threw caution to the wind when it came to criticizing it.  In retrospect, I can understand the issue many people have with it.  After some research, I discovered that some of the odd pacing developed because Madhouse was waiting with bated breath for their best animators for a future episodes.  This left a few episodes when the heroes invaded the Ant King's stronghold narration heavy and quite boring.  It certainly had the DBZ effect for awhile, and I was left slightly confused.  I also find it hard to believe that Hisoka didn't make his presence known upon the Ant King displaying his immense power.  Since Hisoka was so fixed on fighting the strongest person he could lay his eyes on, I was sure he'd emerge in this arc.
Despite the few negatives I have with it, the Chimera Ant arc is nothing short of spectacular.  The amount of themes explored is staggering.  Sure, most animes probably would've taken the safe route and made Meruem some sort of bloodthirsty tyrant with zero regard to humanity.  But the introduction of Komugi certainly turned the arc upside down and changed Meruem's view of humans entirely.  The way the inner monologues were written during his Gungi battles was inspiring and refreshing.  I was certain the King would end up vanquishing everything in sight, but he saw more than just brute strength as a display of power.  Man, Togashi didn't dissapoint again.  Killua's transformation after Kite perished was also uplifting.  As my favorite character in the series, it was exciting to see Killua break away from his brother's burden and play such an integral role in saving the human race.  Lastly, Gon's transformation, although some would be quick to criticize its “convenience effect”... I thought was well constructed.  The effects his brief, immense power had on his body were believable and warranted.  It also reinforced the type of person and Nen user Gon was in the first place.
The last arc, although slightly rushed added a nice bow to the magnificent anime.  I thought it was unnecessary to introduce 12 new characters so close to the end, but I guess the new Chairman selection served as nothing more than plot support for the more pressing issue at hand, Gon's recovery.  I actually thought (well, hoped) that Killua and Illumi were going to fight in this arc, but I guess we can't all be pleased.  Leorio's reappearance was refreshing and reminded me how much I enjoyed him as a character.  Most importantly, after Gon recovered, his father/son moment was everything I imagined it would be and more.  Ging look flustered but quickly adapted to talking to his son, who was so much like him.  When the closing sequence played after Gon and Ging laughed and shared stories atop the World Tree, I actually bawled.  I'm not ashamed to admit it, I had the same reaction when Yu Yu Hakusho concluded.  When you devote so much time to something, it's sad but satisfying to see its conclusion.
Given the staggering amount of characters that HxH contains, I'll try to focus on the ones I feel are main.  Gon, as a main protagonist initially worried me due to his immature personality and blinding trust in others.  However, as the series progressed these qualities became part of his strengths, and his development and growth was made possible through his unparalleled tenacity and heart.  Many people seemed to have issues with his “found” power when he goes to fight Pitou, but this accurately illustrates an equivalent of “making a deal with the devil”.  Gon had gone through so much in order to find out why his father left his home to become a hunter, and while he never received an explicit answer, the journey leading up to meeting Ging made the answer irrelevant.  In contrast, the feelings I had for Gon at the anime's conclusion couldn't be farther from my initial observations.  
Killua was my favorite character from the HxH franchise.  His calm, somber demeanor is contrasted greatly by his murderous capabilities, the quintessential assassin.  His rebellion from his family was strengthened by his unadulterated relationship with Gon.  The two were essentially brothers, and Gon helped Killua unearth emotions he previously felt weren't present in his own body.  His transformation was amazing to witness, and his quarreling relationship with his brother Illumi made the change that much more impressive.  My favorite quote from Killua was “If I ignore a friend I have the ability to help, wouldn't I be betraying him?”  It really shows his growth as a character throughout the series. His inner monologues always made the show more enjoyable and really offered a perspective often omitted from most series out there.
Leorio was a fan favorite and was unfortunately missing from the show's biggest arc.  His enthusiasm and vigor, although sometimes unnecessary was a joy to watch, and I wished he played a larger role in the overall story.  From what I understand, he plays a much larger role in the manga and gets the “screen time” he deserves.  Kurapika also initially rubbed me the wrong way, but steamrolled into the limelight during the Phantom Troupe arc and reversed my opinion entirely.  Again, he was another character completely left out of the later arcs, and I find it hard to believe that he wouldn't be willing to help out Gon and Killua if the the fate of mankind was actually at stake.  Instead, we were left with odd shots of him looking stressed out in front of multiple pairs of scarlet eyes.  Hisoka was probably my second favorite character, as he was clearly an atypical villain.  You didn't always root against him, as part of me really wanted to see him go all out in a 1 on 1 against Chrollo.  Sure, he gave off a pedophilic vibe and often pissed off the wrong people, but it was refreshing to have an antagonist who had some depth and wasn't one-dimensional.  
The music in HxH is uplifting, suspenseful and “mostly” well placed.  There were a few instances of misplaced background music, but nothing major.  It was irregular but refreshing to see the same OP though the entire anime.  I can assuredly say that a year from now when I hear this OP, I'll probably choke back tears of nostalgia from how powerful it was to me.  The ED's were mostly additive, with the exception of the one in the Greed Island arc.  I mostly preferred the first ED as well as the Chimera Ant arc ED due to the contrast it had to the subject matter within each episode.  Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the sound was the voice acting in HxH.  Every voice seemed to emulate the portrayed character pefectly, most importantly in Mariya Ise as Killua and Keiji Fujiwara as Leorio.  Hisoka's VA also performed brilliantly and left an overall creepy aura over his persona.  There was rarely an awkwardly casted role in HxH at all which led to the relatability of the characters.  
In summation, I thoroughly enjoyed HxH for everything that it was.  Whether it was for the endearing and complex characters, or for the intellectual battles the respective characters consistently found themselves in.  Mix that with the engrossing environments, real-life themes and incredible voice acting and music, and you'll find yourself immersed in a shounen for the ages.  Maybe I'm still drunk on the aftershocks of the series, but either way it was truly a masterpiece.  It really baffles me as to how small the fan base is for HxH, as it is clearly superior to most (if not all) long running shounen out there, and it contains nearly every necessary element for success in the genre.  Nor is there any filler.  I mean, what more could an anime fan ask for?  I only wish that if the franchise is rebooted in anime form that Togashi exercises the same level of finesse he did with this series, as it is one that will remain one of my favorites for years to come.  I plan on eventually watching the 1999 version at some point, but I'd better let my Togashi high rest for a little while.  While not a perfect 10 due to some minor issues I had, HxH is pretty damn close.  As always, thank you for reading!",9

                Much like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, the 2011 reboot of Hunter x Hunter is grossly overrated. This is a show that is definitely a cut above other battle shonen programmes like Naruto and Bleach, but it receives much more praise than it actually deserves. There's this backward-ass mentality here on MAL that causes people to hold shonen programmes to a much lower standard than what they'd hold anything else so when a shonen programme DOES come out that defies various conventions of the genre, it's automatically deemed a masterpiece and ends up in the Top 50 here on MAL. This was the case with Fullmetal Alchemist:
                  Brotherhood, Gintama, and Attack on Titan and now the cycle continues with Hunter x Hunter.
This isn't to say that I don't like Hunter x Hunter, because I honestly do like the programme. It had this ebullient charm that was lost in the recent sea of grimdark shonen programmes that came out over the last couple of years like Attack on Titan and Akame ga Kill!. This show combined the light-hearted atmosphere of shows like Dragon Ball and One Piece, the wit and humour of Yu Yu Hakusho, and the maturity that came with shows like Fullmetal Alchemist and Rurouni Kenshin. Hunter x Hunter had virtually everything I could ever want from a battle shonen programme along with the kitchen sink. What's more is that when it did decide to drop the shenanigans and take itself seriously, it was able to do so without going overboard. The stakes were gradually getting higher and higher, but it still retained some of the ebullient charm that made me gravitate toward this show in the first place.
The very concept of ""Hunters"" was also something that I adored the shit out of. Much like the Grand Line from One Piece, the whole concept of Hunters allows for adventures of any scope to go down. We could have an arc that shows what it takes to actually become one of these fanciful Hunters, an arc dedicated to simple fighting tournaments, or we could have an arc where the the fate of the world and humanity as we know it rests upon the shoulders of an elite group of Hunters as they combat nightmarish creatures. The possibilities would've been endless were it not for the fact that Yoshihiro Togashi lack's the work ethic of mangakas like Eiichiro Oda. With that said, Togashi shows that he's more than capable of writing up complex characters, countless artifices, plot twists that actually make sense, and all that stuff. As the stakes gradually get higher and higher, you'll be demanding more because you're hooked and living in suspense is killing you. 
Unfortunately, this is the thing that gets my goat with Hunter x Hunter: Yoshihiro Togashi spends all of this time building up your expectations and then instantly shatters them because it's like he gets bored with what he's doing and then moves onto the next arc to do the same exact thing. Take the Yorknew City arc: Kurapika spent so much time chasing down the Phantom Troupe, the villains were all fleshed out really nicely, but what does it amount to in the end? Nothing! Nothing of consequence actually happens by the time the arc is over! Instead of seeing the bombastic conclusion to a story about a person exacting revenge on the monsters who killed his family, we get an ending that reinforces the tired-out cliches of friendship and not becoming the monster that you set out to destroy.
This isn't even getting into what became of the Greed Island arc because that entire ordeal was something that left a sour taste in my mouth and made me want to give up on watching the show altogether. Gon and Killua go into a video game to look for a trace of Gon's father, but the problem is that Gon's father left a message for him saying that there's no clue to his current location. Right off the bat, Gon and Killua's impetus to play the game was shattered. However, all was not lost because Ging said he wanted Gon to have fun playing the game. You know what? That's a sentiment I could get behind and the entire concept of Greed Island being the ultimate game for any Hunter seemed like would bring about some rather entertaining adventures to watch. Unfortunately, the Greed Island arc was just some pathetic excuse for a survival story with one of the worst villains I've ever had the displeasure of seeing as the focus of the entire thing.
The Bomber's entire characterisation amounts to nothing more than ""I'm a bad guy and I kill people for fun."" That in and of itself isn't an entirely bad thing, I mean that's Hisoka in a nutshell too. However, all of the other villains in Hunter x Hunter had a personal connection to the main characters. For example, the Yorknew City arc had the Phantom Troupe and they were the guys that murdered Killua's entire clan. Hell, even the Chimaera Ant arc had Neferpitou who was responsible for doing unspeakable things to a close companion of Gon and Ging's. Bomber lacks any sort of connection like that whatsoever, and so I have no reason to care about what this guy's doing. Hell, he even gets killed off by a bit character once the entire arc is over so that just hammers in how pointless he was to the entire story. This arc could've been omitted completely and NOTHING of relevance would've been lost whatsoever.
Now we come to the Chimaera Ant arc, which is one of the most lauded arcs in all of shonen anime and manga. I can totally see why people would adore the shit out of this arc but it's not flawless. Hell... it has multiple problems, all of which come back to bite this show in the ass. The first (and quite possibly the biggest) problem is that the world-building in Hunter x Hunter up until this point was rather non-existent. The only locations we got to see before this point were Whale Island (Gon's home), the Hunter Exam testing facilities, the Zoldyck family estate, Greed Island, and Yorknew City. The Hunter Exam arc established that there's a vast world out there with countless adventures waiting to be told but we never got a good idea of the finer workings of the world that Hunter x Hunter takes place in.
The Chimaera Ant arc takes place in a place called the ""Mitene Union,"" an island consisting of 5 nations with varying degrees of a turbulent history. This is a complete departure from the previous locations we've experienced before, but the problem here lies with the fact that Togashi brings up all of this political mumbo jumbo into the foray as he also goes along with the story of the Chimaera Ants. For example, we find out that the NGL region where the Chimaera Ant Queen is residing abides by an isolationist, Neo-Luddite culture where anything synthetic or remotely technological is expressly forbidden. That in and of itself would've been more than enough set-up for us but then we learn other irrelevant things like how the NGL was really a front for an international drug cartel and arms-dealing operation along with the founder of the NGL's history via protracted spiels of expository narration. Let's not forget the whole situation with the Republic of East Gorteau among other things as well.
This is all stuff that would've made GREAT material to work with for other arcs, but the problem is that all of this stuff is being shoehorned into an arc about carnivorous mutant insects. As the Chimaera Ant arc progresses, any sort of extraneous material introduced in this arc that could've made excellent subject matter for future arcs ends up eradicated due to various plot developments and that just further reinforces the biggest question that I have with this arc: why did Togashi even bring up these details in the first place if he wasn't going to use them at all? All of this extraneous stuff about Gyro, the NGL, and other such political nonsense could've easily been omitted from the story completely and nothing of consequence would've changed.
On that note, the pacing of the Chimaera Ant arc is absolutely appalling. It took Yoshihiro Togashi NINE YEARS to actually finish this arc because he was going in and out of hiatuses and those protracted breaks he took whilst writing up this arc really do make themselves quite obvious. The anime excerbates this problem by slowing down the pacing of the arc from Episodes 113 through 120. If I'm not mistaken, Togashi was on yet another hiatus when these episodes were being produced so Madhouse was close to running out of material to work with. Whilst I can understand why they intentionally slowed down the pacing of the arc at that point in time, they chose the absolute WORST place to slow everything down. Our team of Hunters were in the middle of invading the Chimaera Ant King's castle and right when the invasion starts, the pacing slows down to such a degree to the point where I'm wondering if I'm watching Gantz again.
Okay, that comparison was a bit too hyperbolic but the point still stands. Madhouse chose to adopt a psychological approach to the whole invasion but that's the problem: THEY WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FAST-PACED INVASION THAT WAS CRITICAL TO THE PLOT. The psychological approach to the invasion would lend itself better to manga than anime as a medium. For seven back-to-back episodes, the pacing of each episode was slower than the flow of sand in an hourglass. I don't care if we got to see what was going on in their heads during such a crucial moment of the story, I wanted to see Gon and everyone else haul some serious ass! To me, there's nothing quite like the lingering feeling of dissatisfaction that stems from being denied my fix of fast-paced and enthralling action and unfortunately, Hunter x Hunter denied me my greatest pleasure multiple times over the course of 148 episodes.
Going off on a bit of a tangent, another problem that the Chimaera Ant arc suffers from is the way Yoshihiro Togashi handles the darker and more complex themes he brings up. The Chimaera Ant arc brings up themes such as survival of the fittest, human nature, and all that stuff but its execution is rather heavy-handed to say the least. I think it's safe to say that Togashi lacks the sort of tact that mangakas like Inio Asano and Naoki Urasawa have when it comes down to tackling darker and deeper themes in a particular work. Instead of operating on two levels where you can either take the story at face value or choose to analyse it further and then draw parallels between it and other things like Monster and Oyasumi Punpun does, Hunter x Hunter opts to just outright tell you ""this is happening, and I want you to know that I'm trying to draw parallels here."" The whole thing just reeks of pretension, and it just gets really irritating after a while.
Also, what really made me dislike the Chimaera Ant arc as a whole is the fact that this is the arc that took that ebullient charm that Hunter x Hunter had from the very beginning and just eviscerates it completely. I have no problem with shonen anime/manga going into darker and deeper themes (that's one of the reasons why I love the Jinchuu arc from Rurouni Kenshin), but seeing Hunter x Hunter go down the grimdark path that so many other shows in recent years went down just never sat right with me. What really drew me toward this series in the first place was the fact that it was a light-hearted and fun shonen programme that still had the capacity to take itself seriously without losing what made it fun to watch in the first place. By the halfway point of the Chimaera Ant arc, the entire show just became tedious and boring to sit through to the point where I stopped caring about what would happen next. That's no exaggeration either. I honestly had no strong feelings one way or the other by the time that the Chimaera Ant arc ended and when the entire series ended as well. Sure, both the arc and the series had a fair enough conclusion but they still don't excuse the fact that this show has some really serious problems.
The world-building was mediocre and it really shows in the Chimaera Ant arc (given that there's so much expository narration), the storytelling repeatedly builds up your expectations only to fail completely at delivering something significant, and many promising characters end up being thrown to the sidelines. Nen as a battle system is intriguing as it's simple and practical, and yet the limitations of Nen are sometimes disregarded completely. For example, Kurapika's a conjurer but if his eyes turn red (and he's learned to change his eye colour on command), he's able to use the other types of Nen at full strength (can you say ""asspull?""). 
Going back to the characters, I've found myself getting frustrated with them so many times. Gon was never really that good of a character to begin with, as he immediately struck me as an imitation of kid Goku but with the ability to differentiate between a man and a woman, but that was forgivable since I still found myself really liking him. Unfortunately, the Chimaera Ant arc had him turn into a complete and total psychopath as he threatened to kill an androgynous cat person/ant thing because it was in the middle of saving a critically injured blind girl. I know that Togashi was trying to show what happens when you let the pursuit of revenge get the better of you, but there's a fucking limit.
Killua on the other hand was quite a delightful character and when Gon was too busy being the bad kind of homicidal maniac, Killua was the one I'd turn to to get some entertainment value. His sarcastic demeanour and approach to virtually everything made the show that much more entertaining to watch, and what's more is that of all the characters in Hunter x Hunter, he's pretty much the only one who's changed in any significant manner from Episode 1 all the way to Episode 148. Whilst that's great for Killua, I can't help but feel like the rest of the time in Hunter x Hunter could've been better spent developing other characters.
Leorio was a character that I really wanted to see more of, especially given that his motivation for becoming a Hunter stemmed from the desire to save his (now deceased) childhood friend from a curable illness whose surgery cost an exorbitant amount of money. That's an amazing motivation to become a Hunter, and I get the feeling that he could've accompanied Gon and Killua on their adventures as a medic/mentor kind of character. Unfortunately, he just HAD to be relegated to comedic relief. Am I the only one who takes umbrage with the fact that comedic relief characters in most shows nowadays have awesome backstories and ultimately end up getting screwed over because they have to be the designated idiot? This is a trend in anime and manga that REALLY needs to stop because it's so fucking annoying.
The other characters in Hunter x Hunter are more of the same. We have countless awesome and likeable characters like Knov, Morel, Knuckle, Shoot, Bisky, and Palm (did I forget to mention that Palm's da waifu?) but the fact that they're all introduced and developed in the Chimaera Ant arc doesn't really feel right to me. To me, it seems like all of these characters should've been introduced in earlier arcs so that we could've had more time with them and then develop a greater attachment to them. I could easily see Morel and Knov being instructors during the Hunter Exam arc, among other things but that's hindsight talking. I swear, retrospect is the worst enemy of everyone, isn't it?
Going away from the story and characters, let's talk about the production values. I don't think it's any stretch of the imagnination to say that the Hunter x Hunter manga has some downright terrible artwork. I mean, Yu Yu Hakusho isn't anything to write home about from a visual standpoint but the piss-poor quality of Togashi's artwork in Hunter x Hunter is just plain inexcusable when we KNOW he can do much better. Thankfully, Madhouse took the piss-poor artwork of the manga and made it look good. Character designs were cleaned up or partially redrawn so they don't look like complete and total garbage, the backgrounds look much better with colour and shading, and what's more is that the animation across the entire show is quite lovely and remarkably consistent. Then again, this IS Madhouse we're talking about: their stories might be hit and miss, but their production quality will always be some damn good stuff!
Their sound work however could use some work. I have no problem with the voice work or anything of the sort. What really makes Hunter x Hunter annoying for me (at least from an audio standpoint) is the opening theme. I never liked it, and the fact that they kept the same OP throughout all 148 episodes is something I take umbrage with on so many levels because it just grates on my ears. What's more is that the all of the EDs that Hunter x Hunter had would've been PERFECT openings: they're all fast-paced, energetic, and just get you pumped to see the next episode! Seriously Madhouse, WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?!?! On the other hand, the rest of the OST has some rather nice BGM to it. My favourite track though would have to be ""On Whale Island"" but that's just my shit taste talking. There is no dub to speak of at the time of writing, but I wouldn't put it past a company like Viz Media or Funimation to license this show and then give it a dub since it's one of [adult swim]'s most requested programmes.
Final thoughts? Well, Hunter x Hunter is a show that definitely does get a lot of stuff right and it certainly is a cut above the more typical shonen programmes but it certainly isn't perfect. How this show got into the Top 10 here on MAL is beyond anything I can comprehend. Then again, this website has baffled me more times than I can count. As it currently stands, Hunter x Hunter is one of the many shows on my list of shows that I started out adoring the shit out of that ultimately ended up disappointing me. On the flip side, it's nowhere near as disappointing as Nagi no Asukara was but let's not get into that. Anyway, that's all for now. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm gonna barricade my house so that the rabid HxH fans can't kill me. Peace :)",7
"
                I'm not a big fan of anime that are 24 episodes or longer as I feel at some point, it will become repetitive, but HxH is one of many exceptions. Every episode left me more interested than before, which is pretty hard for an anime with over 100 episodes. 
Plot: 10
The premise may not sound entirely enticing, but what you have to realize is that the quest to find his father is simply the basis of a magnificent adventure. This journey is filled with twists and turns with each being more surprising than the last. 
Early on, the show already gets pretty dark, so do
                  not let people tell you this show is for children. There is a sufficient amount of comedy though to level out the tone. We also have fights of epic proportions. Fights that will send shivers down your spine. I'd say a good portion of the fights are one-sided slaughters that will either make you say,""Get rekt!"" or ""Man, I liked that guy."" 
Believe it or not, but this show knows how to deliver feels. They know exactly what kind of situations will mess with your heart. 
One of the greatest things about the plot is the lack of filler. For more than 100 episodes, you get development after development after development. Even the few episodes that totally felt like filler had a role in the plot too. Those pseudo-fillers were created to gradually fill up the suspense and tension then have the next episode go full throttle in development. If a show can utilize fillers to their maximum potential, then you know it's going to be one hell of a show.
In short, the show is a non-stop train of anger, joy, curiosity, pity, sadness, & thrill.  
Art: 10
As stated before, one of the biggest reasons as to why people often refuse to watch this show is because they are told it is childish. This belief comes from none other than the art. One look at the main protagonist and they think they're going to be watching some show from 4kids. 
Their loss because besides the MC's ridiculously big eyes and a few other things, everything else is superb. The protagonist may not be to your taste, but I'm sure you will find at least one character who will be. Every single character looks neat and different from one another. The expressions are also spot on. 
The amazing art isn't only limited to the characters. The fight scenes are visually glorious. The animations of the people's powers are just so nice to look at. 
Sound: 10
I don't even know where to start with the sound. From the 1st episode to the last, the OP had the same lyrics and beat yet I enjoyed listening to it every time. Not only was the OP that great, what was shown in the OP changed depending on the arc. With their amazing art, they were able to make it seem like they completely changed the op every single arc, but in reality, it was still the same lovable opening.The same goes for the ED. It may seem different, but it's still the same beautiful music we always hear at the end. 
As for the rest of the show's sounds, the music during certain events are brilliant. The music blends in perfectly with what's going on. Something scary may be happening and bam super ominous music. 
Character: 10
The cast of Hunter x Hunter is god-send. Out of all the characters, there is probably only one character, you're bound to hate. The show is filled with an abundance of villains, but I guarantee you, you will come to love most of them. 
The first character we are introduced to is Gon Freecs, he's your typical head-strong, rash, but kind shounen protagonist who has the will power to do things most aren't capable of. He may come off as annoying sometimes, but he's a competent protagonist. You can't hate him considering what he goes through. Also he is fairly young, so his actions shouldn't warrant complete criticism. 
Next, we have the deuteragonist, Killua Zoldyck. Personally, I like him more than Gon, but that's just me. For one thing, he has a really interesting background, and as you get to know more and more about it, you realize how well-written Killua is. Despite his dark past, he manages to live life to the fullest. On the outside, he appears to be cruel, but that's just how he was raised. Deep down, he's a caring boy, who just wants someone to pull him out of the abyss and guide him towards light. Not to mention, his cruel side mostly only surfaces when those he holds dear are in a predicament. Killua really is just a young boy with a dark past who wants nothing more than to live a happy life with those he cares for. 
Then, there's Kurapika & Leorio. They tend to be treated as the 3rd and 4th protagonist of the show, but they aren't present in a few arcs. Anyways, Kurapika is the type of person who you shouldn't judge by their cover. I mean I thought Kurapika was a girl for a good amount of time. In the group, Kurapika is the voice of reason, he tells them about the consequences of relying too much on emotion. Thing is, that reasoning disappears within the snap of a finger when his past is involved. He tries to remain calm, but if pushed further and further into the corner, he will become someone absolutely hellbent on revenge. Luckily, we have someone to balance out the atmosphere of the group, Leorio. He's somewhat of the comic relief guy. Being relatively old compared to the rest of the group, it's not very surprising that he's used for comedy. From time to time, he has his moments of wisdom as well as total bad-assery. 
Last but not least, we got the rest of the cast, all of them are unique and likable in their own way. Take Hisoka for example, a guy you see a lot throughout the series. Mysterious and sadistic, you just can't help, but love him. If you were to know him in real life, you'd probably avoid him at all costs, and that's what makes him so well received. His character is usually the one you hate in a show, but it's the opposite with Hisoka. You spend 
quite the amount of time anxiously anticipating for Hisoka's next action because you just want to know what else he has left in store or up his sleeve.
Overall: 10
The reason I gave every section a 10 is because Hunter x Hunter truly is a masterpiece. It's dark, funny, sad, & action-packed all at the same time. 
Throw in the fact that 99% of the characters are well-written and you got yourself an adventure beyond your wildest dreams.",10

Enjoyment/Overall: 10
This show is everything I want in an anime. Stunning visuals, awesome/catchy soundtrack, great story, and some of the most likable and interesting characters to ever appear in anime. Please, Japan, make more shows like this one.-Details-
Story: 8
Genres: Action, Adventure, Shonen, Superpower
Themes: Friendship, Aloof/Badass/Mysterious father, Coming-of-Age, Individualism (Natsume Soseki) vs serving the group first, Human nature, Good vs evil
The basic premise of this show is not too different than other shonen fighters. The main character, Gon Freecss, was abandoned by his father who wanted to pursue his own adventures as a hunter rather than raise a kid. Now Gon wants to become a hunter in order to understand why being a hunter is apparently so great (that one would even abandon their kid) and also so that he can become strong enough to find his dad.
Thus the story unfolds. Gon takes the hunter exam, gets stronger, and makes plenty of friends along the way. Standard shonen stuff. Now that I think about it, there isn't much more to the actual story than this. Every arc before the chimera ant arc is directly related to finding Gon's dad. The chimera ant arc is a bit of an aside, though it does take up about half the story at this point due to its length. So, as a story, it's pretty simple. I'd say the main reason why the story seems so good is because pretty much every other aspect of this anime is amazing, and so those aspects help turn a simple, somewhat unconventional, story into something truly worth remembering.
There is no filler. However, the aforementioned chimera ant arc is rather long and is probably stretched a bit too much. Other than that, the pacing is very good.  After the chimera ant arc there is one more arc, and then the show basically stops without really ending.  Many people would probably find this frustrating.  It's possible that one day Madhouse will add another season or 2 of this show but that depends on the manga actually getting somewhere, which many people despairingly think will not happen for a while.  Thus, don't come into this show expecting complete resolution.  You get some of that since it stops between story arcs, but it's still clear the story isn't done.
The most prominent story telling technique is the action earlier on, and later it becomes a combination of action and drama. The story starts out rather light-hearted with fun fights and such, but starting with the Greed Island arc the story starts to show where it's going. Darker themes begin to emerge with eviler villains, and more graphic violence is shown on-screen. One of the best parts of the show later on is the drama pulled from character development, intense fights, and some episodes which actually feature pretty decent philosophical discussions. One of the more apparent themes the show discusses is whether individualism or a group oriented disposition is more conducive to individual growth and group growth. So, it takes a little while before this becomes apparent, but this is definitely a show that both entertains with action but also gives you something to think about. 
Art: 10
Studio: Madhouse
Madhouse does not fail to impress. Earlier on the art features bright, fun colors and is very clean. The animation is generally good and only becomes great during action scenes. But later on, in the chimera ant arc, Madhouse shifted into another gear and made the visuals really amazing and stylized. The source of the superpowers in this show, ""Nen,"" is the perfect excuse to start making scenes look really awesome. Nen is one's life force, which one can focus into a useful offensive or defensive force. Nen can manifest visually, thus when someone is angry their nen can look darker and more intimidating. Madhouse portrays this phenomenon by adding swirling black currents of whispy air/gas substances around a character, for example. This looks really cool during some of the more dramatic scenes and is the kind of stylization that can really only be done with anime. And personally, when I find an anime that makes use of the fact that it is an anime and does something only this medium can do, I love it.
Another thing I like is the CG is used sparingly, and when it is used, you hardly notice it. It is mostly used for things like cars or planes, which I find is probably the best way to use CG in anime. All of the action sequences are done with beautiful, stylized traditional animation, and I love Madhouse for that. I've re-watched episodes just for the visuals.
Various character designs are updated and improved from the 1999 version of the anime. Overall I'd say that the visuals are of this version are superior to the 1999 version in pretty much every way. The opening and ending themes all look great too, especially opening themes #5 and #6.
Sound: 9
I'm never very good at judging a soundtrack, but even I know this one is good. The opening and ending themes fit very, very well with this show. The biggest gripe I see with this though is that the opening theme is basically the same each season (only a few lines of lyrics are ever changed--basically, the opening theme doesn't ever change, though the visuals do). But this isn't much of a problem for me since I love the opening theme and it really does fit the show well. As far as I can tell, every track is great and fits with both the combat scenes and the down-time. Later on, there are some classical pieces added to the soundtrack, which are always awesome, and there are some darker tracks that really enhance the intense scenes you get later on in this show.  I can't sit here and describe them because spoilers.
Sound effects and voice acting are also very good. One voice I especially love is Hisoka's.  His creepy, perverted, blood-knight personality is captured perfectly by the voice actor. Gon's adorable childishness but also his anger at various points in the story are also done very well. Really, I have no complaints. This simply is high quality stuff all-around.
Character: 10
The characters are all amazing. Hands down. Gon may seem to be another Goku clone--young, innocent, with prodigious fighting talent, but he really is his own unique character. The development he gets later on, especially in the chimera ant arc, is amazing and actually quite surprising. At this point in the show, he practically seems like a different person when compared with his initial appearance. Killua and his family of assassins are all very interesting. One of the things I liked the most early on was the friendship between Gon and Killua. They are actually shown doing things that two 12-year-old boys would do, like messing around, having pillow fights, running around and exploring islands and their surroundings, etc. The compatibility of their personalities and the strength of their friendship is something that is very touching at points, and I would go as far as to say that it is an ideal friendship. 
Another thing that is so great about this show is the sheer number of good, interesting characters with interesting character designs, as well as the complexity of their personalities. It is hard to say there are any straight-up good or evil characters--things aren't that simple in this universe. A character you start out hating, you might end up loving by the time their story is through, and vice-versa. The power system in this show is highly personalized and so it is always fun to see a new character's powers; there are still some that haven't been revealed, and guessing what they might be is also fun.
If you like shows with a large, fun, and diverse cast of interesting characters with an aesthetically pleasing set of character designs, then look no further.
Enjoyment/Overall: 10
This show is just plain fun. It's fun to see the characters grow; it's fun to see them develop their powers and guess in what ways they will grow; it's fun to accompany Gon and Killua on their big adventure, etc., etc. It is hard to find faults with this show. The art is beautiful, the soundtrack is awesome and catchy, the characters are highly memorable, the story is solid and interesting. Only one arc--the chimera ant arc--could be said to be longer than it needs to be, but it is also the most well-written, interesting, and visually stunning story arc so far. I have already watched all of the episodes twice so far, and I already want to watch it all again. This show is a classic. 
The only reason I can think of why you might not like this show is simply if you don't like fun adventures for the sake of being fun. Note that this is not a criticism--everyone's tastes are different. I have a friend at school who tends to only like literature that is more academic in nature--stories by the likes of Dostoevsky and such. Sure, this show isn't a novel and it isn't going to appear in your literature class at university. But it doesn't need to. Chances are that if you watch anime, you don't care about a show's value as literature or a novel story in the first place. Very few do. I only bother to bring this up for the 0.01% of you who actually care about this, like my friend.
One last point: I do believe that relative newbies to anime could enjoy this too. There is almost no fan-service and a relatively low amount of anime weirdness. If I had my way, I'd make everyone watch this.",10
"
                If you ask me, there is and will never be an anime as good as Hunter X Hunter. No anime has ever accomplished what Hunter X Hunter has. And in my honest belief, there will be no anime that will ever do so. This anime knew what the viewers wanted, like as if the audience had decided what the anime should do next, except with a better twist, a thicker more fluid plot, a humorous laugh, epic fights, and an ultimate finish. This anime knew when to stop and when to keep going, when to be all about friendship and trust but at the same
                  time keep it toned down so that people could feel the true effects of comradery and being friends. They knew when to add epic fight scenes, and when to get serious upon being jokeful and laughing. This anime had kept things within limits, not too little so that you won't enjoy it, but not too much so that you feel as if you had had enough of it. It made you feel the ultimate impact of things, it didn't rely on simple tactics or surface reasonings to decide the outcome of this anime. All throughout the anime, it had not disappointed once. Every moment had been fun and enjoyable, with great quality and not a single drop of disappointment was spilled. It had a fluid story, one that didn't feel random and contrived, but one that flowed smoothly and made you feel as if you were watching one consecutive story. Not a jumbled mess of random occurrences, based on coincidences and, ""when I felt like it."" I'm not going to play koi, I'm talking about Fairy Tail. The difference between these animes, at least the major ones that I had clearly noticed, are three things. One, Fairy Tail almost never stayed within reasonable boundaries, logic was thrown out, and this made fights become contrived and boring. Relying on the ""doing it for my friends,"" tactic, gaining their comrades immense amounts of power for almost no logical reason. Secondly, the comradery was too much, it simply became corny and annoying after a while. This made the audience rather bored with no effect intact, hunter x hunter knew when to stop, which helped the audience feel the full message, but at the same time, not getting so overwhelmed by it. And lastly, the random jumbled story that Fairy Tail has, the events and story archs simply came one after another. There was no logical flow to it. It had more felt like a multitude of plays rather than one consecutive show. Hunter X Hunter had a fluid story, it made you feel like everything that happened made sense. *Small Spoilers* The hunter x hunter exam begins, killua meets his brother, killua gets practically hypnotized and gon and his friends search for him, they save him, they need to get stronger so gon can punch hisoka in the face, they go to the tower of heavens. Even only going this far, there feels to be a continuous story, although I won't explain why Gon must punch Hisoka in the face... as I have probably already spilled too much, everything has a reason, nothing is coincidence. There are two last things I would love to point out before ending this review, it is that Hunter X Hunter, had made me feel more emotion than clannad, more hyped up adrenaline than Fairy Tail, more joyous and laughing moments than Beelzebub, and honestly, is the best anime to such date. Hunter X Hunter always stayed within reasonable boundaries, as said before, so jokes, action scenes, even the sad scenes, all seemed natural and flowed well. They didn't put the scenes there so it could make you cry, there was a reason these people were crying, it didn't go too far either so you could feel the affect of every moment. Even the jokes themselves, they managed to make me laugh to the point of not being able to breathe because I got the jokes, they played humor on what you might see in actual life. Its reasonable and logical, making you feel everything but without going too far. The second thing I would like to add, as said probably numerous amounts of times in here, is that Hunter X Hunter, is logical and reasonable. It doesn't rely on simple tactics to base the anime off of. No matter how many times you promise you're going to win, whether your friends die or not, you will not be able to beat an opponent whos stronger than you. This is something nearly ever shounen anime breaks logic of, cough cough FAIRY TAIL... If you're weaker than them, you train, you get stronger, and you fight them. If you won, it isn't because you gained tremendous power losing a friend, its because you worked hard at it. Hunter X Hunter understands this, and follows this, it feels like as if everything was staying in logical boundaries, and it made the anime more enjoyable overall. It made the action more enjoyable, it made the experiences more realistic, it made the moments stupendous. Even scenes that were sad, it was nothing like Clannad, that don't get me wrong, it was sad indeed, but it also went overboard. I could not feel the affect of the moment, only the tears because the scene knew how to be sad, but it felt almost forced, acted, somehow. In Hunter X Hunter, even though I had not cried I felt the affect of the moment. And that is what made me feel even more sad than Clannad itself. This anime had stayed great until the very end, not a single moment had I regretted it, and at the end it only got better. Everything was wrapped up, no misconceptions were left behind, and it left with an epic finish. There is no other thing to call this anime, a once in a literal life time anime, but a masterpiece.",10

                This guide will contain NO spoilers, and I would say this is one of the safer reads for someone still asking themselves ""Should I watch this?""
Pior to watching Hunter x Hunter, Shonen genre held a stigma for me. Anything that took 100+ episodes to tell a story was either not telling a story very well, or not telling a very good story. This assumption still holds true for many of the genre, in my opinion. Fairy Tail, Naruto, and Bleach, all series that hold a large fanbase, with many, many dedicated fans that love the genre. Not HXH. 
Hunter x Hunter has the unique quality
                  of running a full 148 episodes, telling a very good story, and never pulling punches. 
CHARACTERS: As said before, I'll keep the spoilers brief.
Gon is a 12 year old boy who wants to be a Hunter. Someone who goes around the world 'Hunting' for something. Gon hunts for his father, someone whom left him at an early age to become a Hunter himself. Wondering how any man could abandon his child, Gon searches to find his Dad, and to experience the wonders of the world that must have driven him away from his child.
As such, he partakes in the Hunter Exams, a brutal and deadly test that culls the weak and rains hell on anyone unprepared. The survivors are granted a Hunter License, which allows them funding, and access to restricted areas for their adventures.
There, he meets Leorio, a man whom only wants to get money from the Hunter Exams
Kirapika, a mysterious young boy whom refuses to speak of his reasons,
Killua, a boy raised from a family of assassins whom befriends Gon,
And Hisoka, an extremely unnerving clown looking fellow who is as mysterious as he is powerful.
STORY:
Characters aside, the most interesting thing about the story aside from those that partake in it, is the tropes. Or the lack of, more accurately. 
Characters are weak. Power-ups aren't easy. Sacrifices are made. Not everyone comes out in one piece when facing someone that is clearly stronger. 
I wont talk about the story as much as other reviews, as I want this to be an entirely spoiler free review that doesn't reveal anything from beyond the first arc. 
Gon's quests to find his Dad isn't as simple as it seems, and it becomes clear that his father expected him to take the Hunter exam. As such, various barriers are put before him before he can even get on the right track for finding his Dad. 
Even more troublesome, Gons friends are often in need of help themselves. Despite this sounding like a round-a-bout plot, the story never loses focus. You will always feel that things are happening for a reason. Moving from point A to point B, with the story moving forward as the characters do. There are no filler arcs, there are no episodes where you feel that nothing important or moving has happened.
This makes Hunter x Hunter much more exciting a watch than other Shonen anime, where many of the arcs seem to be insignificant to the overall plot.
SOUND:
Okay, let me be honest. Two OPs for a 148 series gets boring after a while. Other than a OP that gets old after a while, the ending pieces are godly, and the tracks for scenes always brings a fitting atmosphere to the table. There may have been some scenes where the music choice was off? I don't personally remember any. 
Sound effects wise, there's nothing spectacular. They serve their purpose, and do so well enough that they don't detract from the enjoyment of the visuals.
ART:
I don't have much to commentate about here. There are rarely any points where the art specifically struck me as something to be held in high regard. The art is solid, no doubt, but it doesn't shine with high budget and fluid action too often.
When it does shine, though, it does so nigh-perfectly. Action packed moments that are animated well show great, and its madhouse animators doing their job right.
ENJOYMENT:
Hunter x Hunter made me cry. It made me yell in both anger and confusion, as well as in climatic victory. I'm usually dull faced when I watch anime. I'm easily excited sometimes, but I've cried only 5 or so times at anime. Being able to pull my heart strings like that is, in my opinion, an amazing feat for a writer.
Not only that, but the series had me consistently saying ""What's next"" only to stare at  the episode count in sadness. Since its conclusion, I've taken up the manga, and anxiously await the next chapter.
Please. Watch Hunter x Hunter for 12 episodes or so. If you are not captivated by then, drop it.",10
"
                I have heard many times about the anime Hunter X Hunter and every time, wherever the title of this title appears, only praise and praise for this work sounded. After a while, I myself had the pleasure of evaluating this ""masterpiece"" after which one single question “Was it a joke?” Stuck in my head, if so, then I did not understand the humor.
I've seen a lot of anime like this, some were really interesting and some are better forgotten. I would love to forget this piece of animation. I honestly tried to see at least a bit of what I was promised by numerous reviews,
                  tops and reviews. Several times I dropped and resumed watching this episode, cherishing a faint hope “It will be better further! A couple more episodes and I will see those exciting battles that I have heard so much about, another episode and the main characters will begin to really open up, change and move on. A couple of minutes more and an interesting monologue, a thought, at least a word, will sound from the mouth of another ripped-eyed character! "". Yes, powerfully I was so wrong, it’s just a shame.
The first thing I want to do is go through the characters:
Main characters:
1) Gon - When watching the first thirty episodes, I got a clear feeling that the author periodically forgot about this character. This little boy (super creature, mega talent, one in a billion, but that's not the point) from the point of view of the banal logic of behavior, jumps back and forth like a table tennis ball. At one moment, he does not tolerate murder, at another, with a perky smile, he asks to teach him how to pull out the heart at lightning speed. Either he can calmly watch the death of other people during the qualifying tournament, then he is turned back from it so that he cannot watch. At certain points, he is ready to forgive even a maniac killer that a minute ago he wanted to cut a little girl into pieces with scissors (even if she was not defenseless and in fact was much older than the villain, which he did not know), then he smears the killer of his acquaintance into mush (the fact that he spared the maniac demolition that during the whole story arc he blew up people in batches, some of whom were also Ghosn's acquaintances, purely for fun, a separate article altogether). I would also like to note as a separate point that his initial motivation (to find his father) cannot justify the risk to which Gon exposes himself and his friends, since he and his dad are essentially not connected with anything. At the beginning of events, Gon has no idea what his father is like, other than the fact that he abandoned him as an infant for the life of a hunter.
2) Killua - Gon's faithful friend and partner, who shared a similar ailment, his character throws from side to side like a boat in the middle of a storm. Unlike his partner, this ailment is justified by the plot. For the most part, the character is not bad, there is an interesting internal conflict, development and, in general, a memorable appearance. This character is also remembered for me by the fact that at one point he himself draws attention to the truly incredible number of pianos in the bushes, which the main characters stumbled upon.
This creation has a rich caste of minor characters of varying degrees of quality, from so-so to ""damn it, why the story is not about them?"" Most notable:
• Kurapika - “Hey! I have motivation, character, development, rich backstory and incredible potential for disclosure, and my storyline can be safely turned into a separate series, but I’ll probably stand on the sidelines, or rather drop out of the narrative altogether! "".
• Leorio - “When I was a child from the slums, my best friend died of an incurable disease, which prompted me to become a hunter because for people like me this is the only doctor with an education! Hmm! To grab a prisoner who is clearly deceiving me and risk the dream of my life or act smart and achieve the intended goal, which I have been striving for from young nails? Madam, my name is Leorio! ""
And there are similar characters here in a wagon and a small cart from the pretentious head of a dynasty of the world's best assassins to a huge ant-man-alligator in wrestling tights (This guy didn't surprise anyone? When I saw him, I whinnied for thirty minutes and didn't care about giant cannibal beetles. By the way, do they take clothes?)
Logical holes at the level “Even if the devil himself appears for the exam, he has to pass all the tests, and he will receive a hunter's license” a few episodes later “The hunter exam is designed to weed out weak participants and prevent the hunter's license from falling into bad hands (Three professional killers in the room is probably good people, the one with pink hair is probably just a magician at children's matinees) ”occur so often that it is more difficult to remember the place where the plot begins to follow at least a ghostly logic.
Remember the episode where the queen of chimeras died? There, the Hunters were almost crying looking at her dying body, SERIOUS? LOOK AROUND THERE ARE NOISETTES OF PEOPLE WHICH SHE EATED LIKE SEEDS AND MOUNTAINS OF HUMAN SKULLS ARE YOU SAD ABOUT HER DEATH? And the king's guard does not matter at all, only Neferpita was shown from several sides, and the other two can only indulge in orgasms looking at how good their King is.
Well-staged fights? There were a couple, but I’m not lying, even about six, but for one hundred and fifty episodes this is not enough.
Now the fight of the King of Ant, having forgiven the head of the hunter's association, what abilities have we shown? YES, NOTHING BUT A MANY-HANDED STATUE NETERO and the fact that the king of ants can tolerate well and that's it! 0 hariography 0 tactics. And in the end, SUDDENLY we are faced with the fact that Killua has a sister (brother) who knows how to fulfill wishes! WHAT A TWIST! Do you realize what it is? IS ABLE TO FULFILL DESIRES! DESIRES! That is, you can wish anything!
The result is a dull under-anime with a lot of potential for horrific performance. There are so many jambs and missed opportunities in it that there are so many pages for ten handwritten text, from which high marks from viewers and critics seem incomprehensible to me.",3
"
                 Many people take a look at the childish exterior of this show and without second thought don't even give HxH a chance, but a show that managed to climb in the top lists of many sites and become the favorite anime of many users, certainly does something right that it deserves your minimum attention if nothing more.Every review more or less is a subjective experience of a series, so give me the chance to tell you why I loved this show as much as I did, and what I consider as pros, and what may be seem as cons. 
First of all I love
                  battle shounen as a genre, Dragon Ball was my first cartoon (at least that's what I thought it was) at the age of 13. I've seen a lot of battle shounen and I loved almost all of them back then, but as I grew older and more experienced in anime I inevitably outgrew this genre as the writing seemed ""childish"", repetitive and too predictable so the result was that my enjoyment collapsed. What I was craving for was an anime that would entertain my intellect but at the same time would retain the charm a battle shounen can have, something that would resonate with my ""adult child""(if that makes sense). That's when HxH 1999 was discovered and consequently HxH 2011.
Story/Characters
Not only this show is the charming coming of age story of Gon who embarks on an adventure to find his dad, which retains all those elements that you loved as a child, it is also a well written, structured and thought out, intelligent story that will satisfy your adult mind and feed your intellect exactly what you may be looking for. Wonderful world building, charming and unique characters with depth and development throughout the series that have their own motivations and as the show progresses prove to you that they are more than just some generic archetypes, good characterization which brings interesting and realistic interactions and dynamics between them, unpredictable storyline with jaw dropping moments, superb dialog that reflects realism and maturity, proper build up for any major event that makes you care about what happens, profound and powerful emotional moments, great comedy that isn't silly or too ""childish"" which blends well with tension,drama and action; a creative well thought out battle system which allows for strategic fights that will keep you glued to your seat, and last but not least lots and lots of fun. All that right here combined with perfect pacing makes for an entertaining and engaging story that will make marathoning HxH the easiest thing in the world, and soon enough you will be wishing it was more than just 148 episodes,even episodes with no action are engaging and have some sort of plot or character development. Of course this doesn't mean that as a battle shounen HxH is void of cliches and tropes but even if there are, how they are used in the story and executed is what makes it differ, everything makes sense and every little detail is explained explicitly or not, paying attention is required as the show is dialog heavy and many things are implied,as a result many conclusions can be drawn by association. 
The writer seems to have general knowledge of the world; like human psyche, political and social structures, religion, world economy, history and etc... Combined with his imagination and the nature of the show the result was seven (one is a mini arc) different arcs in their genre, tone, atmosphere, length, themes and at points pacing as well. I know I said “perfect pacing” but that depends on the viewer if he likes the slow down pacing in some arcs. The transition between them feels smooth and logical except maybe for the Chimera Ants arc, but for the rest of them there is subtle at points and at others not so subtle foreshadowing. You will encounter some cheerful and lighthearted arcs, and some that are really dark and grim. Some may view the fact that there is no thematic continuity between arcs, or that some arcs end in an anti climatic manner as a negative aspect or as a ""flaw"", but ultimately it boils down to personal preference and nothing more, personally I like those aspects of the show because an adventure of this type and life itself isn't predictable, and you never know where the next turn might throw you and what challenges you might encounter, I prefer those realistic aspects because it reminds me a simple valuable truth, that today we are alive and tomorrow we are not, so it's all about living life at its fullest no matter where you are at.
Obviously nothing is flawless and even if for me this is the nearest thing to perfection, I'll try to point some things that might be perceived as flaws. I already mentioned the transition between arcs, so I won’t expand on that. Although this adaptation is very faithful to the manga, the first chapter and the introduction of an important character to Gon and plot was cut out from the first episodes and introduced in episode 75, which made some motivations and actions ""clouded"". First episodes seem a little childish and it might take a while for the show to reel you in. The 6th arc (Chimera Ants arc) is the longest in the series and has questionably a few pacing issues and some viewers might lose interest, combined with heavy narration in the second half of the arc and different expectations from the viewers, frustration might arise and enjoyment may collapse, but for an arc that was the most ambitious arc in any shounen I've seen, a story that was far from ordinary, full of reflective ideals that were penetrating and influential, controversial opinions is the least that you should expect. So although the arc might be powerful it doesn't mean everyone will enjoy it, this again depends on your preferences. The last thing that comes to mind as a ""negative"" is the ending, it leaves some sub plots unresolved and a few questions unanswered, although it does have a satisfying ending for a manga that is on hiatus, and ultimately it works really well with the overall theme of the anime. 
Animation
For a long running show the animation is very consistent, this doesn't mean that every episode is greatly animated, it just means that the budget is distributed intelligently and the episodes that needed the boost got it. The fights are really well animated and detailed, with great choreography, and the action scenes are impressive. One of the most astonishing features are the distinct facial expressions, rarely an anime captures so many raw emotions just by the expressions of the face. The colors are vibrant and generally adjust to the tone of the scene and the atmosphere of the arc really well. Character designs are unique, interesting and at some cases really weird, which makes almost all of the chars distinct and memorable.
Sound
This part here gets progressively better as the arcs get progressively more interesting and shift in themes, genre and tone. At the beginning arcs you might notice a misuse of sound that doesn't fit its respective scene in tone but generally the soundtrack is impressive. There are some really remarkable and memorable moments mostly in the Chimera Ant arc. OP song is the same from start to finish and the only songs that change are the ED songs. Voice actors are incredible and fit very well almost to every character except maybe for Kurapika. Jaw dropping performances can be expected from Megumi Han(Gon), Ise Mariya(Killua), Daisuke Namikawa (Hisoka), Ginga Banjou and Nagai Ichiro (as Netero).
Enjoyment
Rarely I rewatch an anime and I've seen this 4 times already. This show has easily the most impactful moments that I'll remember forever from any anime and any media in general. Marathoning this show was as easy as breathing and when it ended I felt sick and wanted more, it was like an addiction but a very fun addiction.
Overall
""The world is like a ride at an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it, you think it's real, cause that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round; it has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very loud and it's fun... for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time, and they begin to question: ""Is this real, or is this just a ride?"" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, and they say, ""Hey - don't worry, don't be afraid - EVER - because... this is just a ride.""  Bill Hicks
This anime is just a ride, a fun and powerful ride that will lead to many roads and detours, a battle shounen that will satisfy a casual viewer and a more experienced one, so give this show a chance and you might discover a detour of your life that will take you to new entertainment heights.",10

                For those who troll saying the original is better, I haven't seen the original, but not having watched the original has no effect on how much I enjoyed the anime for what it was, and it's awesome so far. I don't like writing reviews, especially lengthy ones, because seriously who reads all? 
Story: Finishing the Phantom Troupe arc (ep58), I feel as I have watched enough to criticize the anime. For a shonen, this anime's story gets pretty deep, it's actually enjoyable and it isn't riddled with nonsense super powers or melodrama that every shonen has. EVERYTHING is explained and it makes sense 9/10
Art: Art
                  is great, nothing super-extraordinary but the action sequences are to die for, and animation quality is super consistent. 9/10
Sound: The opening and endings are awesome, the ost's good too. 10/10
Characters: This is where the anime really shines. Every character is 3 dimensional, you could never anticipate completely what a character would do because you're not always given that characters subjective viewpoint all the times. There are instances where every character decides on different actions, and this is due to their conflicting characters, but friendship usually overcomes this.
tl:dr FULL OF CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
For those itching for a shonen anime, watch this one. You will NOT regret it. on a side note, those complaining it's too light hearted in comparison to the original need to reconsider their lives, seriously. Those giving this bad ratings troll saying the 99' is better haven't seen past the first 4 fucking episodes. Their opinions are INVALID.
Overall 9.5/10",9

                This is the best anime I've ever seen and it's not even close, this is in a whole other galaxy of greatness compared to it's peers.
Hunter x Hunter is 148 episodes long (so far) and I devoured it in well under a month, a stunning feat personally for someone who can take months to finish a mere 12 episode series.  
Each part of this show was so enjoyable that it felt as if only a few minutes had passed before the next installment was ready to be wolfed down.
What makes it so good?  ""Takes a huge breath""
The art is modern yet attractive, there
                  is absolutely ZERO filler of any kind, each arc has a clear beginning and end with no two saga's feeling quite the same.
The music is wonderful and fits every moment perfectly.  The opening and closing credits also contain excellent songs and imagery that change to match the tone of each arc.
The intro's and outro's, rather than being a jumble of random scenes like most shows, give subtle hints as to how the story will unfold.  Only as you progress will you be able to appreciate how much thought and intelligence went into making them.
What makes the show truly great though are it's three core tenants; smarts, surprise and variety.
It is cunning and cleverness that often define the victor in this world and right up to the final episode the show was still subverting my expectations with how much wit it had to display.
None of the above would mean anything of course unless you have a great cast of characters to take advantage of, and boy oh boy, Hunter x Hunter has enough of those to fill a dozen epic sized anime's to bursting.
There's so much more detailed praise I'd like to give but I wont because you need to savour all the surprises and excitement for yourself first-hand if you decide to watch it, which I really, really recommend you do.
If you like anime, great stories, or superbly crafted entertainment you simply must watch Hunter x Hunter.  It may end up becoming one of your favorite things ever.
It certainly did for me.",10

                [MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD]
People tell me I'm overly cynical. When it comes to new movies, games, shows, or anything really, I'm the first to offer a dose of skepticism and resistance to believe in a production's hype. So when I say I think something is a ""masterpiece"", I mean I think everyone should get off their ass and experience it immediately.
This has proven difficult with Hunter x Hunter, primarily due to its art-style. You see that art-style? That's what Hunter x Hunter is all about. Subverting expectations and proving that you really can't judge a book by its cover. If you're looking at this anime and
                  thinking it might be too childish, I can assure you that it is not. Hunter x Hunter is a shounen anime that defies its genre constantly and defiantly. It is not for typical shounen viewers. It can be dark, depressing, tragic, and often emotionally draining if you get invested in the characters. That being said, I am not going to sit here and tell you why I think you might like Hunter x Hunter. I'm telling you why you need to sit down and watch the 2011 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter right now. Let's begin!
-Art/Animation-
First off, the animation in this show is AMAZING. The animation is silky smooth and very rarely is there evidence of animation shortcuts. If you want an example of one of the few instances of obviously poor animation, there's a few frames of animation where Colt is discovering how to activate his Nen after being punched by Rammot. The animation is very ugly and I think it was someone else animating that or maybe they just forgot it and had to animate last second? I don't know. But other than that, everything is wonderful, full of color, and a clear product of solid direction.  Madhouse poured a lot of money into this production and it certainly shows. 
As for the art style itself, it's a bit of a distraction. The designs of the main characters make sense once you're fully introduced to them, but I was immensely confused when I first started watching. The images I saw, along with the name of the show (Hunter x Hunter) led me to believe that it was going to be some shounen with monster hunting and not much else. Really, I don't know why they're called hunters when the association is responsible for far more than just hunting beasts. That's neither here nor there though. One of the underlying morals of the show is ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" and the name and art certainly convey that well. 
Art and animation get an A+.
-Sound-
Sound was the one area I saw getting the most criticism, which I still don't understand. Maybe people just don't understand music placement? The score in Hunter x Hunter is unreal. It's seriously amazing. Ambient, emotional, poetic; it fits in so many scenes so well that I'm stunned that people think this is the worst part of the show. Really, there's only one bad song in the show and that's the first closing song. The same intro is used for all 148 songs and in some strange way it never gets tiring due to the fact that they change verses for each arc. Plus, it's seriously great. ""Departure!"" has definitely leaped into my list of favorite anime openings ever. 
Before I move on to the story, I'm going to elaborate on what I meant by music placement. Music placement is the art of placing a piece of music on your timeline. It is something that is frequently overlooked and forgotten but I want to stress here just how wonderful a job they did here. If you've ever had an instance where a piece of music comes in and you're thrown off by how jarring or inappropriate it is, that's bad music placement. Sometimes the right mood can be pulled off by inserting a song later into a scene rather than sooner, or if the creator is really brilliant he'll pull the score out completely. There's three such instances in this anime I want to highlight in particular.
In episode 131 (if you've seen it, you know where I'm going with this), Gon goes through his famous breakdown after being informed by Neferpitou that Kite has been dead all along and she basically lied to him when she told her she would travel to Peijing to heal him. Gon goes absolutely berserk, transforming into an insanely powerful advanced-age version of himself. Throughout the entire scene, the score changes rapidly from song to song as the tone gets darker and darker. This scene is full of so many intense and raw emotions that there was simply no way they could have covered it with just one piece. It starts with intense choral music, then by the time Killua sees Gon, transfers to a very soft piano piece to establish the mood perfectly for an emotional character moment between the two. And the effect is unreal. There is so much tension and hatred conveyed by the score and visuals yet the overall tone of the scene isn't lost amidst the frantic changes in music. That is NOT easy to pull off.
Example #2 involves the character Melody. I'll talk about her more later, so for now we'll talk about the music itself. Melody has a very soothing piece she plays known as ""No no Haru."" This piece of music, when played by her (she emits her Aura into a flute), heals others' injuries and illness and calms the person listening. She plays these 2 significant times that I recall specifically in the Yorknew City arc, but that's not what I'm getting at here. Twice more, in later arcs, the same music is used in a different context and bizarrely enough the viewer gets the same relaxing and soothing effect as when it's played by Melody. This leaves an odd sort of Pavlovian response in the audience, as they're feeling the same emotion without the previous stimulus. It's something I honestly don't think I've ever seen before. 
As for example #3, we'll look at episode 135. Episode 135 is the heart-breaking episode that closes the Chimera Ant arc, wherein Meurem and Komugi spend their final moments together playing Gungi together. To say this scene is beautiful is underselling it massively. This is simply one of the most emotional and well-crafted character scenes I've ever seen across any medium. During the last few moments of the episode, there are a few lines of dialogue overlayed with cuts of Meurem's En particles piercing the pitch black, along with Komugi holding Meurem in her arms. There is no music playing during any of these lines. The dialogue says everything and the complete silence outside of the lines being delivered creates an unbelievably tragic atmosphere. Only about 40 seconds into the scene does the music kick in, and by that point the scene alone has already dictated the tone. It doesn't feel like you're watching two characters from a TV show spending their final moments together. It feels like you're right there with them. It's so well-done and emotional that I honestly can't even talk about it without tearing up. Let's just move on...
Sounds gets an A+.
-Story-
The bread and butter of Hunter x Hunter is the story. The 2011 Hunter x Hunter anime adaptation encompasses the Hunter Exam arc, Zoldyck Family arc, Heavens Arena arc, Yorknew City arc, Greed Island arc, Chimera Ant arc, and 13th Hunter Chairman Election arc. The Chairman Election is essentially an epilogue due to it closing the show. 
If I'm being honest, I don't have much to say about any of the first 5 arcs. While they're all great, they aren't the reason I'm writing this. What inspired me to share my love for this anime was, as you probably guessed, the Chimera ant arc. Hell, I wouldn't be writing this review at all if not for that arc. Now I'm not going to sit here and offer up philosophical implications and parallels to history, as that's been covered elsewhere. We're going to crack open this arc and see what makes it work so well. 
First off, a typical sign of great writing in general is a large pool of set-ups and payoffs. A la, you introduce a plot element or character trait, and then after a certain point, you take that element and resolve it. The Chimera ant arc is an example of complete mastery of this art. I mean no exaggeration when every plot element I recall being introduced and set up in this arc was also paid off within it. Every single plot element and incident has a purpose. Nothing goes to waste. When I was initially scribbling down notes for this review, I decided I would take one specific, seemingly insignificant detail they highlighted to see if they paid it off. At one point, I noticed Knov take off his shoes after getting blood on them. I honestly didn't think they would use it as a setup despite noting it, but...I was wrong. A few episodes or so later and Welfin notices a pair of bloody shoes and uses them as evidence in the incident he's investigating. There's a set-up and a payoff. And that's just a detail that doesn't even really matter; the point is that they go well out of their way to re-incorporate previous plot points or ideas. In fact, some of the more emotional scenes in this arc comes specifically as a result of some previous setup.
Take for example, the moment when Reina (reborn as a a Chimera ant) re-unites with her mother. This wasn't some random incident meant to give the audience a false feeling of warmth. There was a setup that led to that point. Very early in the arc, a pair of children (brother and sister) are attacked by a Chimera ant, killed, eaten, and turned into ant soldiers. The little boy tries protecting the girl, pleading her to run, before being killed by the monster. The girl tries to run but is frozen with fear. That little girl was Reina. Set-up and payoff. In an earlier scene, Colt is seen by the Queen's side following the birth of Meurem. As the other Royal Guard no longer care for the Queen now that the King has been born, Colt is forced to sit and watch in anguish and helplessness as his mother dies before him. He weeps as she dies and proclaims his frustration at his failure to protect his mother. Just after saying that, it shows a flashback to that same scene from earlier, a little boy failing to protect his sister. That little boy was Colt. His guilt for not being able to protect a loved one (his words not mine!) have just been increased tenfold and the audience can feel the weight of the emotional distress cast upon Colt. One set-up leads to two payoffs involving 2 different characters. That's what I'm getting at. It's about not taking shortcuts and using your own plot points to dictate the story rather than some absurd vision filled with deus ex machina and plot holes. It's what gives this arc, and the whole show, life and fantastic vision. 
The writing in general is certainly a strong point. Stakes are always established and explored, character motivations always clear (mostly) and every action a character makes is one that would help them or get them closer to what they want to achieve, there are tons of arcs for characters you wouldn't expect, and the rules for Nen are established early and held firm. Weird, right? You take the basics of storytelling for granted until a show like this comes around and makes it a staple of its presentation to get it right.
There are a few problems with the storytelling though that initially had me leaning towards giving the show a 9 instead of a 10. Throughout the show, the writers have a bit of a hard time delivering exposition. Oftentimes during fights or in really obvious exposition scenes, all action and plot is stopped to explain indirectly what is happening. Take for example the scene where Hisoka is explaining to Machi how he beat Kastro, in a very long and drawn-out scene that exists to establish Machi's powers and explain in detail how Hisoka's power works. The problem is this scene drags way too long and outlives its purpose. Exposition is best delivered while something else is happening. Either through creative framing or having a character moment are good ways to keep the action moving works well, but just sitting there not moving the plot forward is not a good way to do it. This becomes a very big problem during the Chimera ant arc.
That arc is plagued by excessive and redundant narration that drags the story out to a horrifically slow pace. I don't know what happened that made them decide that there needed to be narration explaining things that just happened or things that could have been told visually, but it gets irritating real fast if you're like me and hate being told what can be shown.
As such, the story gets an A.
-Characters-
Now, we come to the true strength of Hunter x Hunter. The characters. This is one of the best casts of characters I have ever come across. Nearly every single character in the show is likable or relatable in some way, and it feels as though they're always evolving.
We'll move in order. First off, you have the main 4 characters; Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio. Gon and Killua are our main characters for the entire show. 
We'll start with Gon. Gon is a simple-minded but determined 12-year old boy who serves as the primary protagonist. He has oddly heightened senses and his curiosity often takes precedence over his fear. His wish is to become a Hunter to discover why his father chose being a Hunter over being Gon's father. His flaws lie in his impulsiveness and fiery temper. He can be a bit short-sighted, and often feels the need to compulsively prove others wrong who doubt him. He also can become so angry that he loses sight of everything else around him. He has a propensity for not understanding when an opponent is far superior to him due to his own confidence, which has gotten him into hot water a few times.
You know what that was? Character traits, character motivation, and character flaws. You know those things that other shows sometimes forget to include like weakness, vulnerability, and drive? Yeah, they didn't forget here. 
As for Killua? Killua is Gon's best friend, and is basically the second protagonist (moreso during the Chairman Election arc). He's quick-thinking and very confident in his abilities. His reason for initially taking the Hunter exam was ""for fun"", but he ends up creating a friendship with Gon that blossoms throughout the series. At the same time, he's a bit reckless with his own life and often puts others before himself without thought. He also struggles to face enemies that appear to be stronger than him. He would always take flight instead of attempting to fight and overcome a stronger opponent. This is brought to a head when Bisky calls him out on it and forces him to face his weakness head on. Given the opportunity to just run like always, Killua buckles down and, after a vicious struggle, overcomes his weakness and becomes all the more stronger for it.
That last part? That's a character arc. Yeah, where characters change and grow like real people. I'll spare you two more winded paragraphs on Kurapika and Leorio to talk more about how brilliantly the characters are utilized in the show.
When I talked about how Hunter x Hunter earlier is basically an exercise of the mantra ""Don't judge a book by its cover"", I was mostly referring to characters. There are a slew of characters that defy common tropes and challenge the audience to re-evaluate the way they see people and how they empathize towards other people. 
My first example is the above mentioned Melody. To put it bluntly, Melody is not exactly an attractive person physically. She's short and rather stocky. She has a huge bald spot on her head and her front teeth are like a rat's. But she wasn't always this way. Upon listening to a single movement of the Sonata of Darkness, a piece apparently composed by the devil himself, her skin was warped; her flesh exposed and leaving her rather unattractive looking. However, her character itself is what makes her fascinating. She is unusually kind and calm, and is unusually attuned to the feelings of others. Her goal is to find and destroy the Sonata so that no one else has to suffer the same fate as her. Melody is a challenge issued by the author. You're never shown what she looked like before. What you see before you is what you get. The question the author is asking is: Can you empathize with someone who looks like a rat, and society would tell you is ""ugly""? Can you look past her exposed flesh and balding head and find beauty in her strong personality, even after such a disastrous fate has befallen her? Personally I found her presence moving and very endearing.
My second example is actually my favorite character in the entire show, Komugi. Komugi, physically, is a young girl with thick black eyebrows, simple attire and a simple appearance, punctuated by an unsightly strand of snot hanging from each of her nostrils. She's clumsy, she clearly has a lisp, and her overall demeanor is not what I would call appealing. Oh yeah, did I mention she's blind? 
While I do adore her character design, it's her personality that made me immediately invest myself in her emotionally. Komugi is the world champion Gungi player, summoned by Meurem to be defeated by him along with several other strategy game champions. Naturally, Meurem initially underestimates her, balking at the mere idea of her beating him. And as everyone expected (/sarcasm), she schools him. Time and time again, she beats him even when Meurem thought for sure he had her beat.
As the games between the two become more and more intense, Meurem grows fond of her, and she becomes the catalyst for the King's arc. He stops seeing people as livestock and starts seeing them as individuals worthy of respect. While his ultimate goal doesn't change, his emotions clearly compromise his ability to stay focused. At one point, Meurem threatens to take Komugi's arm if she loses, anticipating the fear might rattle her enough for Meurem to win. Instead, Komugi reveals that she'd rather play for her life: she only sees herself as acceptable as long as she doesn't lose. For you see, Komugi is the breadwinner for her family due to her being the World Champion of Gungi. But should she lose even once, due to the feast-or-famine nature of Gungi competition, she will become the greatest burden upon her family as she will make nothing. She would consider herself worthless garbage at that point.
That's a burden. A burden can be one of the most effective ways to endear a character to an audience. And that's exactly what it did. After she said that, I immediately fell in love with her character and personality, and was hoping she made it out of everything okay. 
Her symbolic presence also had a great deal of weight in making me enjoy her character so much. Komugi represents innocence (or naivete) in the face of immense danger or a time of fear. She is a shining light that leads Meurem in perhaps a better direction than the one he was initially projected.
So the challenge to the audience this time was this: can you respect this pathetic looking little girl? This blind, sniveling, bumbling, insecure mess of a creature? And honestly, if even one thing about her appearance were different, I don't think I would like her as much. But as is, her demeanor and looks are perfect in my eyes to support this archetype. 
Also in tow are what I consider ""joke characters"", or characters that appear to exist basically just as a punchline. Initially I pegged Palm, Knuckle, and Shoot to fit that mold. But to my surprise, the writers chose to give depth to what would otherwise be silly one-offs. While Palm initially has a very silly and edgy appearance, she changes and becomes an important part of the plot. Shoot is initially portrayed as a ""Coward"", as the narrator comically declares him. But as the story unfolds, Shoot overcomes his cowardice and grows strong enough to challenge the much stronger Youpi. Knuckle I thought for sure was a joke character due to his ridiculous appearance and silly personality. But once again, I was wrong. He has a soft spot for dogs and animals in general (which I find very relatable) and has a very strong personality. He ended up being one of my favorite characters. The point I'm getting at is they have taken what could have been shallow, dull characters and gave depth and personality to smaller roles. Rather than just using Knuckle and Shoot as one-off Deus Ex Machina roles to further the boys' growth, the author chooses to have Gon and Killua lose to them. This is done not only to ground Gon and Killua, but also to establish Knuckle and Shoot as recurring characters. That is going out of your way as a creator and writer to subvert bad, cliched writing and replace it with something smart and driven. Frankly, it's genius.
And I didn't even mention Welfin and Ikalgo. I could write two more lengthy paragraphs on them, but for the sake of brevity I'll stop here. 
Characters get an A+.
-Enjoyment-
What do you think? I freaking loved Hunter x Hunter. I'll admit thought most of my enjoyment came from the Chimera ant arc. While everything up to that point was great, that arc was the one that established a firm emotional connection with me and had me hooked. I had a blast and I have a few more characters to add to my favorites list. Neferpitou, Kurapika, Komugi, Kite, and Melody are just a few names I don't think I'll be forgetting any time soon. 
Hunter x Hunter succeeded in one of the most important aspects of fiction: making an emotional connection with the audience. I feel no shame in admitting I cried 10 times during Hunter x Hunter. That's 7 more times than I did during Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, a show I consider this one to be on equal footing with. Hell, I can't even talk about the Komugi and Meurem death scene without crying. No, seriously. I tried and failed while writing this review. I'm glad I watched this anime and hope it stays with me for the rest of my life.
If I were to grade for enjoyment, it would be an A+.
And with that, I'm done talking about Hunter x Hunter. As I watched the last episode, I couldn't help but jot down a few last notes to close my review with. 
The entire final sequence of Gon climbing the tree is symbolic. The World Tree is a metaphor for the adventure Gon has experienced up until now, and Ging at the top is a metaphor for the end of his journey. And as he meets and discusses his life with his newly found father, Ging delivers the line I'll finish with:
""You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want."" -Ging Freecs
Hunter x Hunter gets a 10/10.",10
"
                When you watch anime, what makes you sit there and think ""This is something that is worth my time""--what is the turning point where you fall in love with it's plot and characters where it's hard to criticize it? For many people we all have that one anime where really, you can't think of much (or anything at all) to complain about. Well let me tell you something, Hunter x Hunter could probably be that one.
Hunter x Hunter's plot comes across quite simple; the story of Gon Freeccs, a young boy who sets out on a journey after learning his Father isn't dead, in order
                  to become a Hunter. With an engaging storyline and characters that are both multi-faceted and ones in which the audience can connect with, it's an anime that will definitely leave a good impression on people despite it's surprising lack of popularity. The thing about Hunter x Hunter is that it isn't really like your typical shounen anime. There are some questionable characters and turns in the show where you're left wondering what will happen next, while at the same time adds in a good amount of light-hearted comedy and sentimental moments to ease out the tension. At 148 episodes long divided into seven unique arcs, it's definitely longer than most people are use to (12 - 24 episodes average), but is most definitely worth the extra time and dedication.
The animation in HxH is quite frankly flawless, I applaud Madhouse for their efforts. When you make a comparison of the remake to the original, it's quite astounding how different, yet still fitting, the style is. Another bonus is that the quality of the animation never seems to falter through out the series and pleasantly stays consistant. With plenty of fighting scenes carried out so smoothly, there are times you'll want to pause and go frame by frame just to admire it. Another thing I love is how they show the characters expressions that capture the mood so perfectly, this is even more so during dramatized scenes where there are close ups of characters facial expressions of anger and sadness. The scenery and background are also lovingly done, whether it's the busy streets of York New city or the wild nature of the NGL, it really captures just how open the world is in HxH, where as in many anime the characters can almost feel boxed in by their environments.
The sound for the series is quite fitting. The OST is particularly great and only progressively gets better as the series goes on. The Chimera Ant arc I found had plenty of wonderful tracks, my particular favourite being the one during Netero vs. Meruem. As for the voices, everyone's voices fit quite perfectly and do a splendid job in portraying their characters.
When it comes to the characters, it's really incredible how unique each of them are, many of them definitely transcending typical anime archetypes. Togashi has done an amazing job developing them through out the story, even minor characters and the antagonists. You can't help but love everyone simply because of how well they have been portrayed that the audience is easily able to connect with them.
While I said that HxH was an anime in which many people could find it hard to complain about, there have been a few things that fit into that very, very small category. One unique element of HxH is the narration of the storyline that is done, while definitely not the first anime to do so, it has a unique way of doing it that sets a different pace to the storyline and add in a bit more dramatization. For some people, including myself, it's an element that only adds to the plot and allows the audience to become more drawn into the show and gives in a third person perspective to how things unfold exactly; for others however, the narration can be a bit of a put off and upset the balance in which people find in it. The narration is used especially during the Chimera Ant arc in which many people can find it to be a bit too heavy. Really it's a hit or miss thing for many people, so this is more so a subject that is set to personal opinion.
The pacing many find can be another issue. The beginning of HxH starts off a bit slow, about three or four episodes it takes for people to really get into it, which can cause some people to drop the show and that leaves me really upset because of how much they will be missing out on due to more or less a lack of patience. But really when you have tons of anime coming out each season, it can be hard to really wittle it down to what is worth your time and what isn't (hint: HxH is definitely worth your time). The Chimera Ant arc again also can have a bit of a pacing issue; as the biggest arc within the anime, it's definitely a long journey in which the audience can feel exhausted about and wondering when exactly it'll be over. There are episodes where you can get bored easily, however I find there is always something that enables the audience to come back and get interested once more.
Overall, when you watch Hunter x Hunter, as with any other anime, a big thing that it comes down to is how much you really enjoyed the show overall. You can get as analytic and deep into it as you want, but how much fun did you have watching it? That's a question only you can answer. For me, I enjoyed Hunter x Hunter immensely. To be honest, it's probably now one of my favourite animes now. It's hard to describe how much you can actually enjoy a show, especially one as well done as Hunter x Hunter; there was a point in the show where I was crying for about two hours straight. While the first few episodes can seem slow and the overall synopsis quite simple and bland, don't let it fool you. Hunter x Hunter is so much more than it appears, and gives to the audience a whole new experience that is hard to deny. So do yourself a favour and go and watch Hunter x Hunter",10

                I've been meaning to write a review for this show, but in truth it's hard to word how I feel about HXH.  It's very special, I think,  and is one of those anime that is worthy of a 10/10 rating for me even while not being perfect.  People say this show is under-rated, but this simply isn't the case anymore.  If you go look at the first page of reviews, they're practically all 10/10's.  Now that the show's over, I expect there to be a tidal wave of nay-sayers who pick up on the small flaws this show does have
                  and begin the ""this show is OVERRATED"" train.  Before we get that sea of 8's, 7's and below, I want to make it clear why this show is worthy of such a high rating.  My greatest fear for this show is that the hype for this show that exists now will cause a lot of people to start tearing it apart in these reviews, trying to prove it's not as good as people think it is.  Whether or it is, the fact remains that it will always be a 10/10 to me and a lot of other people and there ARE reasons.  Put simply, this show IS worth your time.
Story: 9
This is an interesting aspect of the show to rate.  If this makes sense, HXH is not very original, but it is extremely unique.  It has a way of taking very common storylines/themes (fighting tournaments, super-human battles, aura-based abilities/leveling up aspects) and while sticking to the typical guns with them in a lot of ways the show provides a unique spin on them.  A big way it does this is with the characters, which definitely fit certain archetypes but have a depth and emotional connection strong enough to make any used plot line feel fresh and new.  A lot of the ""fighting aspects"" are different from other shounen, in that they don't end up stretched out over several episodes and quite often evolve into more of a ""strategic stand-off"" than an all out physical fight to see who can kick more ass.   At it's core, the show is simply about Gon trying to find his father.  The story itself is nothing new (even if well executed), but the twist, turns, character development and eventual scale make this story a solid 9 for me.
Art: 8
I see a lot of praise for the art here, and while it is certainly not undeserved the art has never been my favorite part of this show.  The character designs all work (with maybe some Chimera Ant exceptions) and it definitely doesn't have the feeling that they were cheap with the animation.  However, although there are some really beautiful scenes that have some amazing imagery to accompany them, the animation didn't typically go above and beyond enough to put it on such a high pedestal.  Definitely not a show where you'll typically hate the art though, so rest easy there.
Sound: 8
Again, I feel similarly on the sound as I do with the art.  Really nothing bad here, either; in fact, the music accompanies the show extremely well and at times it adds a whole lot to a scene.  The intro has grown on me quite a bit, although I feel like you either like it or you don't and it won't take you too long to decide.  Honestly, I might have gone with a 9 here if the in-show music didn't get a LITTLE repetitive at times (particularly in earlier arcs).  As with the art though,the sound is solid and will typically only add to your enjoyment of the show.
Character: 10
This is one of the major elements of the show that I feel bring it to a 10.  If you are bothered by the trope of an over-powered character, you may find this show either really annoying or a huge breath of fresh air.  The characters are constantly growing more and more powerful, and as the time goes by some ridiculously strong characters are introduced.  However, at least with the main characters, they do not just start off awesome as in some shows.  There is a huge learning curve for the main characters, and you are really able to see them grow in terms of ability and character.  And especially as it progresses, the show is pretty good about keeping morality pretty gray, not forgetting that even the most interesting of protagonists must have flaws and vices to make them real.  Even when it brings in a bunch of new characters with a lot of focus late in the game, by the end of their arc you will be able to see them in a whole new light.  What can I say, the character development in HXH is TIGHT.  If you're looking for a journey where you will really care about the characters and the changes they go through, this is definitely a show for you.
Enjoyment: 10
This. This is what makes the show a 10 for me.  You can nit-pick over details and tiny flaws all day.  At the end of the day, I seriously enjoyed all 148 episodes of this show, and I typically am more fond of shorter ones (usually don't go above 25).  I'm not sure I've ever seen a show I could binge in such a hardcore way.  Everything from laughs, to thrills, to the eventual change in tone.  You know, where you have to stop and try to figure out when this stopped being a light-hearted (if violent) show about powerful 12 year-olds and when it became a dark thriller that has you on the edge of your seat.  There are definitely some strong feels here too, particularly later  on.  All I can say in this category is that it's hard to think of may shows I've genuinely enjoyed this much, anime or otherwise.
Overall: 10
My opinion is obviously very high for this show, and I'm definitely not the only one.  I'm writing this review for one reason alone: to recommend this show as fairly as I can.  Though my vote is a 10/10, it is certainly not the only valid rating for this show.  I think it all depends on what makes or breaks a show for you.  My main goal is to break it down in a way that will give you an idea of it's the show for you or not.
PROS:  Excellent character depth, thrilling plot, long journey with great payoff, a whole lot of heart, light-hearted enough to keep you invested in the characters and not weighed down by the intensity (sometimes) but dark enough at times to fully contrast this and remind you that this is NOT a show for children, and a LOT of interesting people, places, creatures, and powers.
CONS: There are so many characters that sometimes you may go a long time without seeing one of your favorites, the show is very long- while some people are addicted enough not to notice, it's still over100 (which isn't too bad for shounen like this but still), and in some of the longer arcs (looking at you, Chimera Ant) seem to stretch a bit at the middle.  
End of the day, this is something special and it deserves the time to give it a shot.",10

                First review here!
I was skeptical about starting this series at first, and the fact that the first few episodes were a bit dry didn't help.  But I can now say that I am glad that I saw it through to the end.
Story - 10/10
Beginning of the series was a little slow, but once it kicked off, the story started to unravel, revealing all sorts of twists and turns along the way.  It was lighthearted one moment and had me on the verge of tears in the next.  There was a good mix of action, comedy, romance, and all other sorts of good
                  stuff.  The transitions between different arcs was especially good as well, considering how nicely everything flowed together.
Art - 9/10
The art for this show was one of the main reasons I was hesitant to start the series.  I told myself that if the plot was good (which it was), then I would continue watching it, despite the art style.  But with a few episodes in, I was already in love with the art.  Fight scenes were especially pleasing to look at, although certain parts could have been a bit more developed.  Facial expressions were also a big part to this show, whether they portrayed happiness, sorrow, or anger.  
Sound - 9/10 
The soundtrack for this show is exceptional.  Switching off from moments of silence to heartfelt orchestrated pieces to just overall intense music, not very much felt out of place.  I grew to associate different songs with different characters and there was not really a piece that I disliked.  Although some may dislike the opening song because it was the only opening throughout the entire series, I think it was used well.  All the ending songs were remarkable as well, especially as the end of each episode nicely transitioned into them.  
Characters - 10/10
Heroes and villains alike, each character had a reason to be somewhere at a certain place and time.  Seeing the main protagonists go about on their journey and grow as characters was very rewarding.  Although there were many, many characters that were introduced, each one was memorable; many made reappearances in different arcs.  Seeing the characters' mental states of mind and internal struggles really pulled the show together, showing that not everyone was as powerful or overpowered as they seemed to be.  Each one was unique, having different abilities suited to their talents and preferences.  Hunter x Hunter has some of the best villains in my opinion, whether I grew to empathize with some or truly just despise others.  
Enjoyment - 10/10
I'm very slow when it comes to watching shows as I need time in between episodes and such.  But with this series, I zipped through the series in two weeks, which is much faster than I had expected.  I couldn't help but keep clicking to each next episode.  Although the beginning and some parts in the middle seemed a little slow, it was all done for good reason.  Everything seemed to come together, from music to character to story, etc.  I really did enjoy this show a lot and am considering to rewatch it after I watch the 1999 version.  
Overall - 10/10
If I could give Hunter x Hunter a higher rating, I would.  This show has climbed up to the top of my list of favorites and it was an enjoyable ride from start to finish.  Despite the big number of episodes, nothing seemed unnecessary and there was little to no fillers, which I find admirable for such a long show.  All previous doubts I had for this show disappeared once I started it and it really is a must-see show for everyone.",10
"
                Hunter x Hunter, shortly after completing this masterpiece I finally figured out why it's even called that, despite knowing almost nothing about this show going into it, with my only key words being ""shounen"" ""action"" and ""very very long"". But now, 148 episodes of pure epicness later, I can say with extreme confidence that this is one of the best anime made to date, and why it should take up a spot on your favourite's list.
Story:  10
Wow, what an absolute adventure, the story may not grasp you in the first few episodes, but once your hooked, you can't stop. HxH follows the story of
                  Gon Freecss, a young boy who plans to embark on a journey to find his father, who abandoned his son to become a hunter, an occupation in their world which constitutes doing whatever you want, as long as you do it well. Gon takes on the hunter exam to become a hunter himself, to firstly see what it's all about. During the exam he meets fellow exam takers Kurapika, Leorio and Killua, who all have brilliant back stories and motives. (with the exception of Leorio, no dark stuff for him) Gon quickly makes friends with all of them, and the story proceeds with their adventures together. The story consists of about 6 arcs, varying in length, and all feature different characters with fantastic roles. All these arcs can sometimes feel slow to get into after finishing the previous arc, but as aforementioned, once it grabs you, you can't stop. One of my friends who had been watching this as it aired described watching it only once a week as ""hell""
Art: 9
The art of HxH is fantastic, far better than the original (although that is expected) The character designs are fantastic, and keep the best aspects of the original artwork, while maintaining a good design. The fight scenes of this show are absolutely stunning, all the colours and vibrant punches thrown never get old, and with the surplus of surprises in the story, the artwork simply compliments the already perfect flow of the anime.
Sound: 10
I think only one thing needs to be said here: *ahem* YOU CAN SMIIIIIIIIIILE AGAIIIIIN!!!!!!!!
Ah, but in all seriousness that opening will never feel boring, and will never be skipped. Both versions of ""Departure"" are fantastic, and suit the show so well. Now the endings though, these blew me away, especially ""Hunting for your dream"" played through the Yorknew City Arc, was just too good, I listened to that song everyday, and still do, the ed for most of the Chimera Ant Arc, ""Nagareboshi Kirari"" was also fantastic. Amazing choice of music, and the ambient, suspenseful, happy, sad, and every other kind of music used in this show could not have been better, created one of the best atmosphere's every episode.
Characters: 10
Loved almost every character that was introduces throughout this series, even the bad ones like Hisoka, Chrollo, the Chimera Ant King, Etc. The way that all the character's interact with each other is just amazing, they all have their ups and downs, but sometimes you get those badass moments where you can't help but just get this feel-good feeling in your stomach as they obliterate their enemies and save their friends. The relationships between some of the characters, the most obvious being Gon and Killua, is incredible, the friendship between them is questioned throughout the whole series, and there are so many obstacles they must overcome in order to stay friends. The struggles only make the beautiful resolutions feel that much better.
Enjoyment: 10
It took me a little while to get into the chimera ant thing at first, every other arc was just amazing, can't complain about anything else. Enjoyed every minute to the fullest.
Overall: 10
If you haven't watched this series, do it, you will 100% not regret it, if you are daunted by the high episode count, watch it arc at a time, and savor the moments that feel best, because when you've finished this anime, the amount of satisfaction you feel inside is only matched by the emptiness of realising it's over, so take action now, and embark on your very own journey of Hunter x Hunter!

                Suffice to say, I cannot explain Hunter X Hunter (2011) in just a few words. I’m a little late on the hype because I waited for the remake to finish before I could watch it as a whole; but anyway, right now, I’m on the verge of extracting my feelings to all of you after watching yet again a fantastic shounen anime.  
I’ll just let you know that I’ve watched the first series before the remake and I might give off some short comparison between the two in some parts of my review (please do not get annoyed). However, that does not mean that
                  the other is superior to the other.  Don’t worry; I will not give any spoilers.
ELEMENTS OF THE STORY
PLOT - It’s tiring to even say the synopsis so I’ll have to get to the point. I loved how the author arranged the arcs in an organized way. It isn’t confusing and you will definitely have fun trying to remember those moments. Also, you can actually tell which part is which. Lastly, every arc is enjoyable and encouraging to see in their most valuable way. Let me describe each of those.
1.	Hunter Exam – It is one of the most highlighted events in the lives of the 4 characters; Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio. For the most part, in this event you will see more action, less dramatic happenings and a lot more challenges that you could think of. Just participating in the exam is horrifying.
2.	Zoldyck Family – Killua is quite peculiar but more so, his family is also strange but a lot more. In this arc, there will be more tests that the comrades will face that are as difficult as the vicious Hunter Exam.
3.	Heavens Arena and Nen – This one is as far as I’m concerned, one of the most entertaining part of the show. I can recall how the characters experienced hell in Heavens Arena (ironic right?) expect more short battles and exciting kicks of the main characters. You will definitely enjoy most of the fights in this show. Oh, and they will learn a new skill that is pretty badass.
4.	Auction and Phantom Rogue – a group that Kurapika serves as a mortal enemy. The four friends face the horrifying and powerful thieves or were they assassins? They are a bit of both.  You will witness more bloodshed and nail-biting as Kurapika et al gamble their lives on defeating the most terrifying criminals that can defeat thousands of armies. 
5.	Greed Island – If you love a good real life video game, I guess you will appreciate this arc. Gon believes that this game has a clue on seeing his Dad so along with Killua and a bunch of new friends, they will win this game and complete the requirements needed. I guess this arc gives the two a no sweat battle. 
6.	Chimera Ants – One word, disturbing. And another one, it’s disgusting. The characters travel on to the next phase of their lives as they discover a new organism in a country, they are called, Chimera ants. You might already have an idea on what a chimera is if you’ve watched the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise. Chimeras are animals infused with human personalities and maybe bodies. Some may look like pure animals but in a way, they look a little evolved. Ants and the human race will get to combat on who will snatch the spot on the top of the food chain. Unexpected deaths will rise and most especially, it has a touch of drama behind it. I really cried in some parts. This arc also helped in honing the development of the characters.
7.	Election and Alluka – This one has less fights. It’s more of a relaxed part of the show. There are minimal battles because of the aftermath on the Chimera Ants match. This arc has more logical thinking and it is also risky. Tears and blood will be shed but for the most part, the ending will cap a new beginning for all of the characters. 
The explanation may not be too long for you guys to understand but I suppose this is my vivid description for most of the relevant parts of the story.
For the sudden comparison, Hunter X Hunter 2011 is better in delivering the story. It has a fast pacing of the turnover of events which is quite more pleasing to use that the old anime. At first, before encountering Hunter X Hunter 2011, I was devastated when I learned that they cut a bunch of funny and entertaining scenes from the manga that was shown from the 1999 series; for example, the famous sushi episode, where it was hard for the characters to please the examiner. On the other hand, I was awakened by the fact that it wasn’t important and either way, the story would’ve advanced even without that part. There is also the fact that it took almost 30 episodes to air the Hunter Exam from the old anime while, in the remake it only took 20 or less episodes. You can never get bored with the both of them but if you’ve already watched the 1999 version, I guess you will understand that fast paced is much superior. However, with the chimera arc, it took like 60 or more episodes to actually visualized and explains the battle. Anyway, the story was longer than in the 1999 version which only ended until the Greed Island arc.
SETTING and ENDING - The settings of the show gave a fulfilling representation of the bizarre yet colorful life of hunters. You will see the vast changes of one arc from the other. I think the bright and refined color of the backgrounds made the show more interesting to watch. The ending was just… WOW. There is no word to explain it. Yeah, somehow it didn’t satisfy the ending for the other characters but I guess it turned out pretty awesome. Thank you, Togashi Yoshihiro. You and your brilliance will shine forever! I hope the story continues on in the manga! 
CHARACTERS – I’m not supposed to take this in a long explanation but I guess I’ll have to say it. Hunter X Hunter has a lot of wide ranged characters. You can actually see the depth and differences between personalities and distinguish them just by looking at their faces. The character design was just flawless in terms of personality but in appearance… not so much. I guess most of the main characters are built up with flat development. Gon Freecs have almost no change with his personality which is predictable but the only development he had to encounter is his hatred and his powers. This one took place in the chimera ant arc. You can see how he changed from the sweetest and kindest character in the story, well, he still is. On the other hand, his emotions changed as he meets new villains and disappointments. The thrill is in with Gon. Leorio is also a flat character. He is aggressively stupid and a bit fond of women. ‘Til the very end, he is the epitome of a stupid and weak hunter but he knows how to overcome that with the help of his friends. Kuapika has a minimal development like Gon. He has potential in yielding his powers and he gets even stronger than before because of revenge. Kurapika is always level-headed but as the story goes on, he cannot control the hidden anguish inside his heart. To be honest, Killua has the most development out of all the characters. He was once a good child, following the demands of his family but as he grew, he realized that there were more treasured people outside of the world. His realization with the world and the discovery that he gathers each time he spends with Gon, helps him to grow and advance into a different person. For the villains, Hisoka is the oddest and scariest of all. I can’t even figure out his true motive. He could be an enemy or an ally. He’s just so confusing and there is no telling whether he is going to kill Gon or not. The other character that caught my attention would be, Meruem. He is a round character for he develops a sensibility inside of him that gives him a sturdy ideology between people and ants. 
EFFECTS:
SOUND – The opening does not condemn me at all. I think the song is a bit off for me. It isn’t my taste and I’m sorry for the comparison but, 1999 version wins when it comes to the opening song. Ohayo will always be my favorite anime song. On the bright side, the 2011 version did great on background music. I enjoy watching the show because of the OST. For the voice dub, I prefer Japanese because the 1999 English dub was just BAD. Notable voices captured my attention such as Sawashiro Miyuki who has the most recognizable voice in the show and Miyano Mamoru. The rest did a really good work.
ANIMATION – Madhouse is in charge of mostly dark anime series like Nana, Death Note and so on.  They are an expertise when producing a dark feel to the show; at the same time, producing an amusing side as well. I love their flexibility when it comes to shows. I hope they serve as an example to other production staff as well. Oh, and they make good chibis. What else, I gues this one has a vibrant color than the old series. I have an issue with Hisoka’s hair, Killua’s fashion sense, and other stuff but I guess both versions are weird in their own ways. 
ENJOYMENT and OVERALL
I definitely had a nice catch with this one. Hunter X Hunter makes a lot of surprises and changes. It has potential in seeking selected audiences with its dark themed and it is full of action. It has everything what a shonen anime makes or represents. Cool characters caring for their friends, anonymous and surprising villains, funny moments, decent quotes and a lot more. I guess I’m writing too much adlib. My favorite parts of this anime (I’m acting like a kid right now I’m sorry) are the Bromance of Gon and Killua, Kurapika’s successful yet failing vengeance, Leorio’s motivation with his friends, Hisoka’s peculiarity, and strong hunters.. especially, the chairman. I’m quite relieved that this ranked 94 in popularity because sometimes popular shows are the most awful ones *coughs*, Fairy Tail, *coughs*, Kuroko no Basuke, *coughs*, so many more. Nevertheless, please watch this awesome anime. Mind you, both versions are both recommendable, I’m sure you will enjoy both shows at a high rate.  I’m even running out of words on how to describe it. You’ll get hooked and will be hooked with this exceptional, special, extraordinary, incomparable, outstanding, remarkable, amazing, unique… Fuck! I need a thesaurus! Please Watch Hunter X Hunter 2011!",10
"
                Well, let me tell you, that I'm not usually easily impressed nor do I usually write reviews; however, there are always exceptions and this anime is one of them.
I loved this anime; the plot, characters and overall anime was amazing; which left me confused when I learned that a lot of my fellow anime watchers didn't like it; and one of the main reason was that 'it looked childish,' and can I just confirm that, this anime is far from it!
Story:
I don't want to spoil anyone, so this bit may come across a little vague; but I'll try my best! Anyway, the story line was
                  great, as far as I know, there wasn't any glaringly obvious plot holes and the plotline was beautifully developed. Compared to other ~long~ animes (animes which have over 50 episodes) all episodes were relevant and didn't contain much 'filler' episodes; or at least, that's what it felt like. The main story line never diverged and kept true to its main point which was, the protagonist, 'Gon' trying to find his father. As with most animes, there are also sub-plots and the subplots were also masterfully done; they were never too 'powerful' that it feels like the main 'quest' have been forgotten; they were enjoyable, yet, to the point.
Going back to the 'childish' thing going on, it is far from it; the anime as a whole is gripping and is very dark; (quite similar to Puella Madoka Magica, where the art style may seem bright and friendly; but the plot is a monster of feels and tears and anything in between). It is a great balance of light-hearted as we see the characters build close bonds with each other, to the comedic antics of other characters to the sorrowful and regrettable deaths of some. To those of you who are seeking romance, well, there is also romance in there.
In all honestly, one of the main reasons for my confusion as to why Hunter X Hunter isn't as popular as other animes (such as Naruto, One Piece and Bleach) is the plot. Hunter X Hunter's plot is ultimately told better, clearer and with much more catharsis than others I know. It has all the elements in it and memorable characters that a fantastic anime needs and a good plotline to boot without too much fan service (there are some, but not overwhelmingly so, that it ruins the show) It is immersive and will leave you speechless. 
Art:
So, the art... I believe the art is one of the reasons, many 'modern' otakus out there tend to scroll by due to the fact that the front cover conveys a very sweet, bright and happy anime; in which all Hunter X Hunter watchers know that it isn't true.
The dynamic art style creates a great contrast between its 'happy' episodes and episodes where there is carnage everywhere; which , for me, creates a stronger impact when one watches it.
Before, someone questions me about it, yes. Yes I have seen the 1999 version of the anime; and it's also good, however, I do prefer the 2011 version. In all honesty, the anime is just as good either versions; so, go for the art style you prefer!  The only reason (and it can be seen as quite silly, I know)  that I prefer the 2011 version is probably that the characters' eyes are more defined and I find that incredibly alluring and absolutely beautiful.
Sound:
I'm going to be honest with you here, I'm a 'watch the opening songs and ending songs once and skip it after that' kind of watcher; so, I don't really have much to say on this topic, however, for the times I've heard it, I actually liked it and I usually don't pay mind to most anime songs. the use of music while watching the episodes are done well and match the atmosphere of whatever the character is doing at the time.
Characters:
Oh my gosh! I can not emphasize enough how wonderful the characters are! First of all, there is a plethora of characters which are well-developed and break the most of the character tropes. The intense, complicated backstories alone is enough to hook you in.
The characters' aesthetics are drawn wonderfully, but the personalities that go with these faces are on another stupendous level. The way the protagonists develop and affect each other is slow, yet fluid. There's no rush nor is there any 'unnatural', suddenly-this-happened-and-I-don't-know-how things occurring during character developments.
All characters have a role and all of them are relevant. Even the villains. And for me, that's rare.
In most animes I've watched, villains are usually just there to be villains; there usually isn't any development on their part; once evil. always evil. In the case of Hunter X Hunter, however, the villains are gloriously well-developed and it is obvious that they are well thought out. before watching this, there wasn't a single villain that I didn't want to get killed as they are usually very two dimensional; however, this series had THE villain. The villain that you knew has their faults and will probably deserve the death that comes to them, but then, something happens and, dear Oedipus, suddenly; you just want to desperately save them! (y'all know who I'm talking about...)
I feel as if I don't have enough eloquence to tell you how amazing these characters are, but, they are amazing! Don't just take my word for it, watch it!!
As for the rating...The ONLY reason I gave this a '9' is that, I felt as if my favourite character didn't have enough screen time; but then again, he's kinda like an anti-hero so, maybe it isn't as unjustified as I think it is.
Enjoyment:
Enjoyment? Are you kidding me? For me, this was a masterpiece!!!! Even without the popcorn, hotdogs and candy I managed to consume during I watched it; and that's saying a lot! I like my food, ya know?
In all seriousness though, It's gripping and immersive. the amount of empathy, sorrow and laughter you'll share with these characters will be unreal. let me tell you now, that this is the only anime I have watched and actually cried over a character. That's saying a lot! I don't cry. Ever. Well, at least not when watching something.
Overall:
I love it. It's one of those 'classics,' ya know? It never gets old and will never get old. I still think that this should have a greater fan base and I will be forever confused and shocked as to why it doesn't. It is definitely in my top 10 and possibly top 5 and I'm not easily impressed.
Definitely has a high 're-watch' rating as I've re-watched this at least 5 times already. It's one of those go-to animes when you want something good and familiar and something that you know won't let you down.
I recommend it to everyone; especially if you have good taste in anime. ;)",10

                What’s so special about Hunter X Hunter?
A glance at any title from MyAnimeList’s Top 7 Highest Rated (excluding Kimi no na Wa) will tell you why it holds a position there. The Gintama franchise combines an array of genres in its wacky, high-octane futuristic tale of wandering samurai. Steins Gate explores the nuances of the idea of time travel with an eccentric, otaku-oriented sense of humor. Legend of the Galactic Heroes presents a years-long struggle for the stars with style, grace, and intellectual brilliance. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood criticizes mankind’s self-centered grasps for power with unflinching honesty. Then, there’s Hunter X Hunter. From the synopsis, HxH
                  is marketed as a superpowered shonen of great length (it’s a whopping 148 episodes long!) that values friendship and following your dreams more than anything else. Compared to the other entries in MAL’s Top Seven (again, excluding Kimi no na Wa), I wouldn’t blame you if you feel indifferent towards HxH’s first impression.
One of the most overused saying is “looks can be deceiving” but it’s nearly-impossible to not be tricked by the show’s Hunter Exam Arc. It begins with Gon Freecss, a happy-go-luck 12 year old island boy, leaving home to follow in the footsteps of his father Ging, who wears the title of “Anime’s Ultimate Deadbeat Dad” like a badge of honor, and become a Hunter, which is basically another word for “adventurous explorer”. Befriending strangers (and enemies), learning new things, and having fun are the Hunter Exam Arc’s raison d’être. Like a true stereotypical shonen, this arc glosses over the harsh realities of the Exam with a passion, choosing to portray it as the premier competitive sport instead of the merciless bloodbath that it really is. It is only when Gon is pushed to the brink of death in a fight against an examinee named Hanzo that the Hunter Exam Arc’s underlying sobriety surges to the forefront.
Despite the Hunter Exam Arc’s shortcomings as a story, the animation is a marvelous spectacle to behold, thanks to HxH being produced by the great Madhouse. Although this series doesn’t offer much in visual creativity, the various tints and shades used in each scene deserves recognition and you can really see Madhouse flexing its muscles with its scenery porn. It’s because of the studio’s spectacular backgrounds that HxH’s diverse settings have a life of their own, from the beautiful yet low-key and withdrawn country of NGL to the mystifying nightlife allure of Yorknew City, and even the angelic homeliness of Whale Island. It doesn’t hurt that mangaka Yoshishiro Togashi has a specialty for world-building; you can tell that he genuinely cares about the environments he creates when he dedicates entire episodes to the traditions and subtle nuances of the setting.
Hunter X Hunter’s theme song “Departure”, considered by even diehard HxH fans as hit or miss, is among the reasons why I trekked through the first arc with disappointment. At first, the only thing I thought Departure was worthy of was the skip button but over time it grew on me. I could say the same for HxH’s soundtrack. Save for a few character themes (Hisoka’s, Leorio’s, and especially the Zoldyck Family’s), most of the songs early on are hardly worth mentioning; they’re grandiose and overpowering but collectively fail to deliver a lasting impact. It is later in the series that a multitude of unforgettable tracks make their dramatic entrance, from the rage-consumed “Chain Bastard” to the stage-setting “Legend of the Martial Artist”, and of course the operatic glory that is “Riot”. What really elevates Hunter X Hunter into the upper echelon of musical experiences is its collection of ending themes. Most people laud the fifth ED, Yuzu’s “Hyouriitai”, as the best of the bunch due to its expertise in pulling heartstrings but my personal favorite is “Hunting for Your Dream”. That ED basically personifies intensity.
More than anything else, Togashi’s greatest skill has to be how he expands a simple shonen premise to include the full range of genres. Hunter X Hunter isn’t just your run-of-the-mill action adventure; it dives into the world of RPGs with gusto, it features a pulse-pounding gangster noir thriller in the Phantom Troupe Arc, its final arc is geared entirely towards politics (Name another shonen that does that), and one episode of the Greed Island Arc deploys practically every cliché of the romantic genre in existence. Oh and then there’s the apocalyptic sci-fi horror epic known as the Chimera Ant Arc.
I consider myself a chill, easygoing guy; it requires a lot of effort to piss me off but for years the one thing that I couldn’t tolerate were ants. They’re commonly viewed in a positive light, as the ideal assembly line workers in an ecosystem thriving on individualism. I, however, have always seen ants as disgusting little monsters that steal whatever they want and attack anyone that’s not one of them. It all started at my daycare during my years as an elementary schooler. My friends and I were tired of being harassed by fire ants every time we played in the sand on our playground. With uncharacteristic fervor, I gathered up my friends and a few other kids that also hated the ants, and we marched up the hill of the playground with sharp sticks in our hands. At the top of the hill, the ants were secured in their headquarters, a misshapen mound as tall as my leg that they built from dirt, and we smashed it to pieces with our sticks, fists, and sneakers. Needless to say, the ants weren’t too pleased with our remodeling and they attacked us without mercy. That incident was the catalyst for my hatred against those tiny insects. Whenever an ant somehow found its way into my house, I’d pursue it like a madman and spray it to death with pesticide. Whenever I saw an ant in public, I’d wildly stomp on it until I was absolutely sure it died. In my family, I was the unofficial ant exterminator.
From the start, you can imagine how I felt towards the Chimera Ants, the most dangerous species in the HxH universe. “Kill them all!” I shouted as the series ventured into new territory, with an arc centered on my greatest nemesis. The Chimera Ant Arc, more than any other arc, appealed to me on a personal level; the Hunters’ quest to destroy the Ants was something I could relate to. It’s also an intriguing arc due to it defining everything the series has been about up to this point; the Chimera Ant Arc ponders over the sacrifices a Hunter must take and ultimately what it means to be human. This arc does this while infusing a level of disturbing darkness that’s unprecedented for a shonen. Some are most likely arguing that Hunter x Hunter has always been dark, especially with the massacre scene in the Phantom Troupe Arc, but nothing in this series even comes close to an Ant gruesomely murdering a beloved background character before devouring the dead body. Nothing comes close to another Ant gleefully watching an elderly man, naked and chained, begging for his life before the Ant squashes the poor guy beneath his hoof (When did HxH become Requiem from the Darkness?). The insert track “New Mutation” is the perfect theme song for the Chimera Ant Arc; it’s a somber, stage-setting melody that emphasizes the mysterious bleakness of it all. What I appreciate most about the Chimera Ant Arc is its brilliance as a character study.
When it comes to characterization in a shonen, the most effort that’s normally applied is the main character dealing with dead parents and the supporting cast aiding the protagonist in his (it’s always a guy) adventure. What originality! What complexity! What realism! Unlike your run-of-the-mill shonen mangakas, Togashi treats the characters he creates as real people. He doesn’t murder them at random nor does he escort them to the background, unless it’s Kurapika after he stole the show in the Phantom Troupe Arc or if it’s one of the show’s few female characters (The lack of respect for women in HxH is astonishing. I’m surprised that this show passed the Bechdel Test). The best part about this show’s cast isn’t how truly dynamic the protagonists are (The changes that Gon and Killua undergo throughout the series are a blessing to behold) nor is it how memorable the antagonists are, save for Chrollo, from Meruem (the thinking man’s villain) to Ilumi (a true master of manipulation) and of course Hisoka (the Joker of anime, he puts the “C” in crazy). No, the greatest thing about this show’s characterization is how the transforms the guys that have no right to warrant speaking roles into complex, realistic figures. Tonpa is the self-proclaimed “Rookie Crusher” of the Hunter Exam; on the surface, every action this man takes in the first arc is one of spineless self-preservation. However, we’re shown through his internal monologues that he strategizes through his every more and that these actions are ones that Tonpa knows will benefit him on his quest to destroy the hopes and dreams of other Examinees. Binolt is a wanted criminal that sparred with Gon and Killua for one episode in the Greed Island Arc, his only appearance in the entire series. Through a memorably poignant backstory we witness the murderer’s reason for becoming a criminal and what he thinks of his life up to this point. We see his shortcomings, both morally and as a fighter, and in the end we see how Binolt is inspired by Gon to become a better person. The best of the background characters, however, has to be Welfin. He’s a Squadron Leader of the Chimera Ant army, a wolf-like being notorious for his constant paranoia. Welfin wishes to become the “Shadow King” of the Ants, which is basically what Dick Cheney was during George W Bush’s presidency, and his every action is designed to help him reach that goal. Later on, he establishes a friendship with Ikalgo, a traitorous Ant, and he starts to abandon his paranoia. Whether or not Welfin has ceased dreaming of being the “Shadow King” is yet to be determined.
The majority of the Chimera Ant Arc has been focused on what demonic menaces the Ants are but in one scene during the arc’s last episodes, the show reveals an even greater evil: us. The opening scene of episode 134 exposes the sinister, corrupt sides of ourselves for the whole world to witness in disgust. Through an old film reel effect, our blatant bigotry, our superiority complex, our sickening sadism and our overwhelming greed bleeds profusely from each heartbreaking frame. “Kingdom of Predators”, one of HxH’s finest insert tracks, plays throughout the scene, increasing in crescendo while patiently unveiling why its song title is fitting. When this scene ran its course, I finally discovered the darkness within myself. I realized that my grudge against ants was established an irrational hatred that began years and years ago. Thanks to Hunter X Hunter’s Kingdom of Predators scene, my interactions with ants have changed. Whereas I used to murder them on sight, I now either ignore them or, if they’re crawling around in my house, I place them in a napkin and escort them out of the house.
Emotional appeal isn’t something that’s mentioned too often when it involves the shonen genre but in HxH, it’s impossible for some events in the story to not pull your heartstrings. In my years watching anime, I admit there have been occasions where my eyes watered but no anime series had caused me to sob uncontrollably. Along came HxH’s episode 124. When Killua confesses to Palm about how worthless he feels in helping Gon in his internal struggle, I sensed tears rolling down the sides of my face. To force a grown man that hadn’t cried in years to break down in tears is simply incredible. To have that same man cry a second time 12 episodes later in the same show is nothing short of a miracle. It’s in episode 136, when a village girl named Reina is reunited with her mom, and they’re both sobbing over how weak and fragile they are. The 2011 adaptation of Hunter X Hunter isn’t the “perfect” series per se but trust me when I say that there will be thousands of Dragon Ball Z rip-offs before we witness another show like this one. HxH is primarily a thinking man’s anime but is more than able to pull off amazing battle sequences when necessary. It expands its horizons to include many genres and ideas but is equally brilliant at priotizing one. Above all else, what other series could be a better fighting game than this one? 148 phenomenal episodes and Hunter X Hunter is still radiating with potential to this day. Now, that’s something special if you ask me.",10

                I feel really lucky to have watched this anime. It is the most compete and entertaining anime I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Some people may be put off by the length of the anime, but honestly I wish it was a lot longer. The story and characters are built up into an endless array of high tension action and adventure.  I'm really hoping that the anime and manga will both be competed; I'm dying not being able to know how this incredible tale will end.

                Okay, so Hunter x Hunter is praised a lot so I gave it a chance. After watching it I think it's the most overrated anime ever, even more than SAO and SnK which are often called overrated. This review is probably more a salty rant intended towards people who have already watched Hunter x Hunter rather than people wondering to watch it, but I'll try too many spoilers.
To clarify, the only real start bias I had was that I didn't watch it until now because I'm not a fan of the art style. 
I will mostly talk about the story since that's what I see
                  praised the most but I'll go over the different points that MAL uses. 
Story: To summerize what I thought about the story; It started good at gradually became worse, reaching the bottom at the later stages of the Chimera Ant arc. There will be a lot of indirect spoilers, so if you want to be spoiler free don't read further than the first part.
The first arc, Hunter exam arc, was actually very interesting especially since I have read/watched many long mainstream battle shounen such as Naruto and One Piece. It's very clear how they influenced each other and share a lot of traits which I found very interesting to examine, in fact Hunter x Hunter might be the basis for the Naruto Chuunin exam arc, however I'm not sure which was published as manga first. We realise there's a lot of different types of hunters and we see some cool creatures in this fantasy world, I'm a big fan of the big turtle/dinosaurs. This is the only arc I would classify as a fantasy adventure. I had trouble understanding why people would call HxH a masterpiece but at least at this point I liked it.
Then there's the Heaven's Arena arc, where the shit begins. The story stops being anything about adventure, now it's just fantasy battle. The battles are more or less pointless, the only purpose is to train the main characters power like going to the gym or pressing the ""Train"" button in an sim dating game.
We are introduced to ""Nen"", which is actually very confusing at this point because we've seen nothing at all to it until this point. They're introducing a very abstract and foreign concept where only one of the 4 concepts Nen consists of has any exposure before this and only very little in Gon's usage of zetsu. 
Then Nen is divided into 6 categories and then there's a persons unique Nen ability... Then there's the advanced Nen techniques etc etc etc... It feels like an endless addition to a battle system which is made up on the spot. 
From this point everything besides Nen basically becomes irrelevant which is honestly a shame. 
Yorknew city arc starts very interesting, but towards the end it gets really silly and bad. The Phantom Troupe which is supposed to a group of the worst criminals in the world actually fights for the power of friendship and ends up sacrificing more than the main cast to save the lives of their friends... I don't have an issue with the power of friendship, but it's not very cool and intimidating when they care more about their friends than the main characters. This was probably to show that the bad guys aren't flat 100% evil people but in this case I just found it lame. Besides that we are also introduced to more useless characters.
Lastly I'm going to talk about the Chimera Ant arc. Honestly, I think this is the worst of any anime I've ever watched. It starts quite interesting by being dark and almost apocalyptic. However it quickly just feels out of place in this bright anime where friendship prevails and leads to 0 consequences. However it switches rapidly between overly serious and extremely silly which I at least found very disturbing. One moment we got chimera ants trying to take over the world where the cast considers if they should be treated humanely or as monsters (which was done poorly imo) and then we got some of the monsters with abilities called sexy stinger and the last bosses having an orgasm while they feed their liquid (Nen) to their leader for 10 minutes.
The pacing was monsterous slow, even worse than the worst parts of mainstream anime. The narrator made it a living hell, explaining everything pointless and the arc included so much useless information. It clearly felt like this arc was drawn out to be as long as possible. 
Art: Honestly I'm not a fan of the art. The art style/character design is older and very simple, which is something I don't like. Gon has a nose sharp enough to cut fruit, the characters pretty much wear the same clothing 24/7 and their style is imo too simple, plain and boring. There was never a point where I thought ""Hey this design is pretty cool"" or something similar. The colouring in the anime in general is pretty nice though.
The animation is good in general and better during important fights, but especially towards the end there's tonnes of loops and still images which only serve to keep the budget low and extend the episodes to be as long as possible. 
Sound: I think the soundtracks are good, very good in fact. However I think they're used very poorly and there's not very many. Maybe this is due to not paying attention but I can only remember around 6 soundtracks, which were played over and over. Something which especially annoyed me was the soundtrack they played every time Nen was involved. 
The voice actors did good though and sfx was also good. 
Characters: I like some of the characters but aside from this, I think the characters are quite poorly done, especially Gon. (For reference I liked Hisoka, Illumi & Killua)
Gon is very straight forward like most shounen MCs however he's slightly different because he's far more childish (and stupid). His stupidity is on a different level which made me hope that the other characters would somehow break him so he could learn. But no. Every stupidity he performs is rewarded and comes without any real consequences. During the hunter exam he refuses to give up despite being totally outclassed and threatened with getting every limb broken? Break all his limbs and spit him in the face please. Not giving up can also trying again even if you fail rather than just being stupid. Also during the Greed Island arc. There's a plan to defeat the Bomber (who is equally silly) but let's not follow it and lose an arm first before following the plan. And then the arm regrows because magic!.. And then when he becomes angry and big, the consequences of doing that are alsog one because of... MAGIC! Or well basically because of magic. Everything he experiences and mistakes he makes are without consequences, even what happens to Kite is reversed in the end...
Gon doesn't grow, he's equally stupid and irresponsible during the entire anime. Also his early defining traits are totally gone later in the anime. First of all, his fishing rod is magically gone after the Heaven's Arena arc which was one of the things that made him unique. Secondly his ability to hide due to his upbringing in the nature is non existant after Yorknew City. You could at least make him enhance his fishing rod.
Then there's Killua. I actually like Killua, he's actually thinking. He actually grows a bit, learns about friendship and how to take risks (or at least they say). However like Gon he begins to lose his individuality, just not as much. During the Greed Island arc for instance he pulls out his yo yos which we've never seen before. Then after he learns to use his lightning properly then RIP yo yo's. His past as assassin doesn't influence how he fights during the later parts of the series which I think is a shame. He was exposed to electricity torture as a kid so his power is electricity! Feels a bit silly imo. Also why not like use the lightning with the yo yos? 
And then we got the rest of the cast where most are irrelevant to anything besides the single arcs they got any real screen time. 
I think a lot of potential was wasted overall with the characters.
Enjoyment: Some parts were more enjoyable than others. During the especially bad parts I had to look actively for bad stuff to be able to find any kind of entertainment or enjoyment in the anime. 
Extra stuff: I read a lot of people say they enjoy the strategy in the fights, but having the characters/narrator explaining what happened after the action doesn't make it into strategy/tactics. 
This anime was the most extreme case of people explaining their abilties, strategies and etc. to the enemy. There was even a character with an ability which required to know the name of another's ability. Why would you even need to name your abilities?
Also the anime even encourages to defy logical solutions and plans. The characters might say their plans are super important to follow and should be priority but pretty much all characters don't follow the plan and act on emotion. 
Overall: Well since the worst arc (Chimera Ant arc) imo filled around 40% of the anime I would say overall Hunter x Hunter is bad 3 or 4/10. If we talked about actual content and not in terms of amount of episodes it would be a lot higher. Aside from that arc I would say HxH is alright, but definitely not a masterpiece. It is everything I see people complain about when it comes to other anime. If you think it's a masterpiece, you're not wrong, I'm just unable to understand why. 
To sound like a review I would recommend this to people who like Index. It shares a lot of the same problems imo but a lot of people also like index so maybe what I consider a problem is a virtue to others.",4
"
                For an Anime that seemingly does everything right, I just can't give lower than a 10, This is a top tier anime by every standard. This is the anime that shows us how a shounen anime should be done!!!
Story 10/10
The Story is amazing, the series de-constructs all the boring and repetitive shounen tropes and change it into something exciting and breath-whelming, Its different , it has variety, Each arc is fresh and it never feels repetitive , No two arcs are the same, It has its share of light arcs, and the pretty dark and gruesome ones, and when it gets dark it gets really
                  dark, no Nakama powers , no resurrection bullshit, the events are always unpredictable and each arc has something new to offer. 
Art 10/10
Seriously this has got to be one of the best drawings and animation I have ever seen, and to come from an ongoing series, the characters and backgrounds are drawn well, the art is consistent and some episodes are just above awesome with their drawings and animation, let's just say that a series like that is worth watching in HD more than SD , The animation is pretty smooth when it need it too.
Sound 10/10
The voice acting is amazing, the voices are powerful and they are consistent with their characters and characteristics, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing and the variety of soundtracks helps them a lot in choosing them in the series, there are sad OSTs , epic ones, the oh shit ones , strategic ones, happy ones, you just find a variety of everything you can think of and they are amazing, I also have to applaud for the two masterpiece OST's Riot and The Last Mission.
Character 10/10
I just have to say that this is by far one of the few anime series that actually develop every character whether it is a villain or a protagonist a companion it is or not, all the characters get developed , we all hear their line of thoughts in this death note style , the characters are not stupid, a lot of mind games are played between characters, and the characters cannot be loved or hated based on who is the strongest , but in fact they are loved for what they are and what they do. Characters develop emotionally and experience wise which is a big plus to this anime
Enjoyment 10/10
the first two episodes were not that enjoyable but when it started in episode 3 I watched a real adventure before my eyes, an adventure where you feel its dangers and you understand its risks and it's unpredictability , It's cruelty too, I just can't say more than that.
Overall 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 / 5 = 10
so it is 10/10 (Masterpiece)",10
"
                It's very hard to believe that this anime is talked about as much. It truly is a masterpiece. It completely crushed the norm of any shonen jump anime that I've ever seen to be quite honest.
The characters are all unique and you can tell how much thought was put into each of them. The plot has never bored me once; always twisting and turning any chance that it gets. On top of that, the animation is phenomenal when it truly needs to be.
From the outside, this anime does not look like much, but I promise you, it is worth the watch. It is everything an
                  anime should be.",10
"
                The story revolves around a young boy named Gon, who wants to search for his father and find out why his father left him to become a Hunter. So he becomes a Hunter himself, finding a few friends along the way.
His friends all get their time to shine (some more than others) in a respective arc, but since Gon is the main protagonist, most of the arcs presented in this story, are revolved around his development.
The entire story felt as if it were just one huge training arc. The protagonist has never been the strongest in every arc presented. He is constantly one-upped by nearly
                  all of his enemies. And that's one thing I enjoy. Where the main protagonist (even though he is considered a genius/having a lot of potential) still gets constantly beat because of the huge difference in experience. And I actually enjoyed watching the training and the growth of the main characters. I absolutely hate it when they off-screen the training (usually in the form of a time-skip) just to become overpowered.
And unlike most anime, instead of gaining power through random means, usually by the conventions of the plot, you MUST sacrifice something to gain power, which is very, very similar to FullMetal Alchemist.
The Art. The art is probably the largest gripe I have with this anime. Many people will immediately judge this anime because the two main protagonist are both children and the atmosphere in the anime looks very bright. Especially at the beginning of it. The 1999 version of the Hunter Exam was done much better and had the atmosphere similar to that of the Chimera Ant Arc. And because of all the brightness, I'd assume that's why many people were caught off-guard by the brutal and ""grim-dark""-ness of the Chimera Ant Arc. I've had many friends, who only watch Seinen anime, immediately reject watching it because of the brightness and how Shonen-y the art was.
Sound - The sound in the first two arc of the story is very lacklustre, but the sound immediately improves ten fold when the Yorknew City arc hits, playing some opera/classical music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE2muDZksP4 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBq7yu8H2kI
It was absolutely magnificent and it stays consistent throughout the rest of the series (Starting from the Yorknew Arc), having another immediate increase in quality when the Chimera Ant Arc hits. I have no idea how so much people have a problem with this. The 1999 Sound is just as good, maybe even better though, it's all a matter of preference. 
Characters - The characters are absolutely phenomenal. Togashi threw in so many characters, you were bound to find at least one that you liked. Nearly every single character is memorable and had their own personality. No characters were carbon copies of each other, like in many other anime. 
This anime has a few things that could have been done better, especially the beginning, but it is absolutely amazing and you cannot watch this entire anime through without finding at least one or multiple parts that you'd think ""Oh, that was pretty cool!"" I recommend to anyone who's into story driven battle anime like FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood. 
If you are a One Piece or Naruto fan and watch this out of spite because people keep referring to it as the ""best shonen,"" you won't enjoy it as much and will be quick to cherry pick all the small inconsistencies (like a lot of the people referring to Episode 131 as an asspull which clearly shows how much they were paying attention to the story) If you're expecting 30 minute badly-paced fights, then you will be disappointed. This is a very story driven anime, if you are one of those people who mindlessly watch anime for the fights, then do not watch it and stay far away from it. If when you're watching this, you're expecting most of the characters to stay static (namely the main character) and be some sort of ""beacon of light"" like Naruto is in his Universe,  then do not watch this anime. Gon (the main character) has some of the most realistic personalities, unlike Naruto and Luffy, and there are times where he hurt his own friends and puts his selfish desires in front of everything else.
Go into this, not having much expectations and you'll probably have one of the best rides watching this.
Please watch more than the first two arcs, because they happen to be the two of the worst of the series and do not immediately be turned off by the art.",10

                One of the best ""mainstream"" anime there is.
While seemingly childish and happy at first, Hunter x Hunter quickly turns into a dark story where a kid and his friends must save people by killing other people, and the search for Gon's dad becomes only a small part of the story.
The story almost never deviates from the manga, which is great, and there isn't any filler (or at least you don't ""feel"" the fillers).
Pun aside, Hunter x Hunter also shines in its animation, which is my personal favourite in any anime. The anime is better than the manga art-wise, in my opinion.
The characters have really great
                  development. Most of the main secondary characters' backstories have a real part in the overall story.
Overall, HxH is one of my favourite anime of all time, and I definitely recommend it to any -(and every)- one.",10
"
                There is a reason for why this anime is ranked as #5 in the Top Anime Page. 
Can you watch this if you're new to anime? Yes.
What you need to know, is that long type of anime series tend to have a slow start. Don't let that scare you off! Even without super intense fighting in the beginning, the series will catch you offguard and make you want to watch always one more episode.
As a typical shounen anime, the MC's power up throughout the series. The beautiful excecution of that is what makes HxH (2011) so much better than your average shounen/action. This series contains
                  one of the best fight scenes ever made.
The art is great (Madhouse never fails, huh?) for the beautiful landscape but also for fighting scenes, characters and the way they made the show feel really alive and exciting.  The character development in this series is great. Not only do the MC's power up and strengthen their bonds as the story progressess but the side characters get also developments. 
If you somehow haven't already seen this anime, consider starting it now! not only do you otherwise miss a great anime but you also miss in my opinion one of the most episodes in anime ever. Yes this series has what it takes to be called a masterpiece.

                I lot of people who dislike shonen have this misconception that all long running series are alike such as Dragon Ball or Naruto and thus give up on any potential great series that have great writing and character development such as Hunter x Hunter. I say to those who dislike shonen I do not blame you. However HxH isn't your typical shonen that tries to impress you with big fights and explosions but rather it gives you a well written and executed story and fights that are amazing because of what they symbolize.
Story & World - 10
The world in this anime is very creative and
                  detailed allowing for complete immersion. This benefits the overall story as it allows the viewer to get completely dragged into the story and the world at the same time. The concept of Hunters is an exciting concept as it allows our main character to start his adventure. Hunters are people who travel and explore different aspects of the world and discover the unknown. This is a perfect combination for the world itself since the Hunter universe is well built and makes us want to see more of it. The concept of a Hunter allows for a reason to explore this beautiful world and see the unseen. The story is both light hearted and dark at times. Do not let its exterior fool you. This anime may look ""happy"" and ""kiddy"" on the outside but it can be just as dark as anime such as Attack on Titan at times. This anime mixes both light tone and dark tone elements together and I personally love both themes. 
Characters - 10
Characters are equally as important when it comes to creating a masterful story. You can't have a good story unless you have engaging characters and the same can be said for vice versa. Hunter x Hunter definitely doesn't fail when it comes to creating complex and interesting characters.
The relationship between Gon and Killua is extremely well done. We see their friendship and bond strengthen throughout the series to the point where you begin to deeply admire their relationship. This is strongly influenced by Killua's past. This is one of the more heart-warming aspects of this series. The writer allows a great deal of insight into our main protagonists psychology through narration. This adds to the intensity and emotion as we see our character develop. This show has the best and most intense development I have ever seen in a shonen. Not just for a shonen but overall as well. An example would be the emotional physiological trauma we see one of our main characters experience. It is intense and shocking at the same time and will have you at the edge of your seat. We see Gon's innocence completely destroyed at one point and see a completely darker side to him.
Kurapika is also one such character who we get to see a darker side too. At the beginning we know he's hell bent on revenge but unlike some people (Sasuke) he's not willing to sacrifice his friends for it. At the beginning he's introduced as a clever and calculative thinker. Later on we see a completely different side to him in the eyes of his families killers. He becomes cold hearted and brutal. A truly disturbing aspect, one which will send shivers down your spine.
The side characters are some of the best and most exciting side characters a series can have. We have Hisoka the weird, pedophile who gets turned on by... even weirder things. The phantom troupe. They're incredible villains. However there's more to them than just being villains. They have a more complex psychology. Sure they ""kill"" and do bad things but it's the relationships they have with one another that sparks my interest about them. Along with each member of the troupe being very unique with very different personalities from each other. It's interesting to watch how everything plays out when they interact with each other. Their relationship is complex and you're not fully sure what to think of it. Do they care about each other? Or do they want to kill each other? These characters are only a few of the many interesting side characters we have in the show. I haven't even gotten to the Zoldycks yet.
Sound/Art - 10/10 MOVIE QUALITY
This is where Hunter x Hunter shines even brighter. The animation is consistently amazing throughout the series. Madhouse truly are to be thanked for this. This series wouldn't be as good if it weren't for the amazing execution and direction of each episode. The ost's are amazing especially in the chimera ant arc. If it weren't for the amazing ost's some scenes wouldn't be as impactful as they are. The openings and credit songs are amazing. They're very memorable and catchy and offer a sort of nostalgic feel because of how they're able to capture the series. 
Overall - Masterpiece!
If you're looking for a great story and characters with a lot of shock factor and twists this is a perfect anime. The world and characters easily get you attached and there's a lot of shock factor because of the well done twists which will honestly leave you jaw dropped. This anime is also perfect if you're looking for something less cliche in the shonen genre and something unique. This anime easily impresses anyone who has a taste for artisticness when it comes to Hunter x Hunter. Hunter x Hunter is an art. Truly a rare and amazing gem.",10

                At first glance Hunter x Hunter seems like the typical shouen anime.  Boy with untapped potential, goes on a journey, getting stronger in battles, etc, etc.  
What sets this apart from most shouen battle anime is the amount of strategizing they do in these fights.   It's not the typical fight between two alpha males relying on the next power up to win the fight.  In fact, almost none of the fights in the series were between two evenly matched foes.   Almost every time, they head into a fight where they're heavily outmatched and it's only through strategies and
                  traps do they complete their objectives.
And the story, the arcs are quite varied.  Some more entertaining than others.  But some of them are very emotional.  Some will make you question which side is really the right side.  This is not the bright shiny shouen as it seems at first, and present some dark heavy themes in it as it goes along.
Anyways, overall this was a wonderful experience!",10

                I found out about Hunter x Hunter through a 2003 issue of Shonen Jump where they showcased the first chapter in English (before I knew what it was) I first started to watch the 1999 version in 2012 and then when I finished the 1999 version at the cliffhanger point, I switched to the 2011 version for the continuation. This anime rivals Yu Yu Hakusho and I never realized it was by the same author Yoshihiro Togashi.
Hunter x Hunter breaks from conventions of the standard Shonen genre; Hunter has its share of Seinen esque elements and shocking situations. One of Hunter’s trademark things is that
                  it does not focus on fighting 100% of the time when compared to other Shonens. Its focus is more on strategic tactics, and psychological aspects. The narrator does a great job at explaining and showing this. Also since almost anyone can die in this anime, it really adds a lot of Drama with the characters because it avoids cliches.
Nen is one of the main ability’s in the series. Being able to manipulate your own life energy and use it as a weapon. However Nen has a strict set of rules and it has limitations. What I like is that it is not plot armor and it can only do so much; I would say it’s more of a tool. I also like the classification system and different types of Nen people possess and can use.
Story & Plot: The story starts off and takes place on Whale Island. A boy named Gon Freecs adventures out into the world to find his father from learning about his profession as a Hunter. Gon wants to find out what being a Hunter means. On his journey he meets people, makes friends, and experiences a lot of things.
There are 7 arcs in total for the Hunter x Hunter anime. They are all unique in every aspect, but fans will tell you that the Yorknew City Arc and the Chimera Ant Arc are fan favorites and among the greats of anime arcs.
Characters: The main cast consists of 4 protagonists
Gon Freecs – Gon is a young kid who is the main protagonist of the story. He is very friendly, adventurous and determined kid. Gon also possesses inhuman senses and is very athletic and rustic. Gon is an interesting character like none other I’ve ever seen.
Killua Zoldyck – Killua is an assassin of the Zoldyck family. He is shown to be similar to Gon in his happy attitude and mischievousness. The other side of him however, can be extremely violent and bloodthirsty. He is also extremely fast and is a quick thinker. His relationship with Gon is the most intricate thing in the anime.
Kurapika – Kurapika is the sole survivor of the kurta clan. Kurapika is a very distant person and he does not open up to people easily. He is very intelligent while also being heavy on morals. Kurapika is a very distant person and does not open up easily to others. He is the friendliest in the group and has some interesting interactions with the other main three.
Leorio Paradinight – Leorio is a guy who aspires to become a doctor to help the poor and many others. Although Leorio can be impulsive and short tempered at times, he is very trustworthy and he puts his friends first before himself and his dreams. He is often the comic relief character and he is closest to Kurapika in friendship.
Animation & Art: Studio Madhouse really does justice to Togashi’s work. The animation is top notch and the art is always solid, colorful, and very grungy at times.
Sound & Music: The sound effects are really high quality. The music was composed by Yoshihisa Hirano. At first the music didn't click for me but after listening to the soundtracks again I have to say the music works very well.
Voice Acting: Japanese voice acting is great; familiar voice actors in the industry are present in this anime.
Final Verdict: You have an intricate and detailed cast of characters, a very well written story for each arc/plot for it to flow nicely, and you have an interesting world as well. I would definitely recommend Hunter x Hunter to anyone. If you’re a fan of Togashi’s previous work Yu Yu Hakusho, you will definitely enjoy it.",10
"
                As you can see, the plot sure sounds simple, the animation looks childish, to be honest I thought it was childish too AT FIRST. A lot of people don't give this anime a chance.  Probably because of how it looks. When you see Naruto, you see a ninja. But when you see Hunter X Hunter, you see a couple of kids. And people don't know that they're badass. Anyways, that's not the point. This anime is underrated because it's too psychological, varied, and complex for a regular shounen fan. 
I highly recommend this anime if you like an actual planned out anime, love FMAB,
                  no filler episodes, an outstanding soundtrack, several amazing arcs, f***ing AMAZING character development, good quality animations, and a catchy opening.
To me this anime is a masterpiece.  Give this Anime a chance.",10
"
                well, this anime is rubbish, first, the story is something pointless and almost disgusting and offensive at times, do you want an example? at one point the main character is on a quest to find his father and dps is about a gangster criminal gang , which is literally very poorly developed, chrollo? a dead character with nothing, feitan? literally nothing, any other member of the gang? i have a power and steal things, besides a dragged and shitty narrative, nothing makes sense and always introduces new things without explanation (like greed island) now the art, it would be good, if it weren't what you'd
                  see in any other anime and also if the designs weren't like ""a loli"" dps ""a clown"" dps ""tomas Shelby"", literally sucks ok, this eh admit it is good, but i don't like it and for me, the moments they are used are rubbish characters, some like chrollo and kurapika are just empty, others are boring, like gon and half of the series, and it goes like this, the only acceptable one is killua but even so, he is still uninteresting well, if the anime didn't start to decay in script and production I would give it a 4 for that part, but the tower's dps was literally almost asleep, the greed island shouldn't exist, and the chimera ants is a poorly made normal shounen bow that by cause of 2% of it is acclaimed, even though the Hunter exam is the best arc but well, this anime wasn’t for me, it’s a boring shounen with something else that made people say it’s good, but it gets lost and becomes cliché note 1",1

                Hunter X Hunter (2011) is something different. Although it looks like another typical shounen it does not have most of its issues. I will now tell you why is this anime treasure among the others in same genre.
When someone decide to watch long shounen series he probably expects few things. Firstly strong character development. Secondly awesome main story which will hold you even through the filler episodes. In the third place visualy and emotionaly strong battles. And for the last already mentioned fillers - episodes which can be funny sometimes but they only delay the main meat of the series.
So ladies and gentlemen, I present
                  you Hunter X Hunter first long shounen anime I ever watched which does NOT have filler episodes. Every episode is connected to the main story line. Enlarding the character development and backstory.
Every episode you will watch the development of the main story and of the main protagonists and antagonists in one of 7 arcs covered by this anime.
Sixth arc and the longest is something about 60 episodes long and its ending is the best this anime has to offers. It will give you chills , tears, laught .. simply everything. It has also very specific way of telling the story. During few 20 mins episodes there are only 2-3 minutes of the story, because it is viewed from prospectives of differents protagonists etc. But enought about spoiling. Lets talk about about the main cast.
Main heroes and antiheroes. In Hunter X hunter it is really difficult to say who is in fact antagonist. Everyone follows their ideals and in the end you will understand their intentions and even the most hatered characters will look like humans. Story itself is developed around two little boys. Gon and Killua. Some say that this anime does not deserve chance because the main protagonists are only 12 years old. I tell you it is not a problem. They are not childish, they cannot be, or they would die, immediately. In many scenes they act more mature then the adult cast. Gon and Killua have two sidekicks Leorio and Kurapika which also gets a lot of screen time and you will enjoy their stories. In fact besides Gon it is really hard to say who is in fact the main protagonist in this anime because every important character gets his screen time and development. Even antagonists. OMG. You will love them. Especially the first one to appear - Hisoka. This ""perverted magician"" is something you will enjoy for the most time and even if his main intention is to ultimately kill our Gon.
Battles. Even this anime uses the typical shounen sign of fighting, yelling name of your ""spell or technique"" during the clash. Especially in the second part of the series after the main heroes gain the ""spiritual power"" which is something what gives hunters their special potential. Nice thing is that main heroes arent overpowered and antagonists are especially on the beggining much stronger.
Telling something specific about story would be waste and in fact in would be very hard regarding many arcs covered. But what you can follow is the boy who is gaining power through his journey to find his father. It sound cliche but it really isnt. Mainly because it is not the only thing which really matters, more important is the will to gain strenght in order to survive in this world. And the end. Although the manga is still ongoing the end of the anime will satisfy you, you will not want to leave this awesome world of hunters and you will look forward for new adventures which can come because the final episodes opens completely new options for story development.
In conclusion. This is a MUST WATCH 10/10. It is treasure which deserves follow up and much bigger fan base. You will enjoy wast background of the story and the world, varied characters and much more.",10

                	Before I delve into my own personal review, I must make clear that I understand that some people will tell you that Hunter x Hunter ""isn't that great"". I can see how that opinion could be formed based upon the fact that one particular arc had a particularly long buildup. I, however, must encourage you strongly to watch this show, because I can guarantee that the first arc AT LEAST will catch your attention. This show left me wanting far more in its wake as well, and touched me in a way that only Fullmetal Alchemist had before. 
	The story is amazing, one of friendship
                  and epic adventure. If you're fond of One Piece, Naruto, Fairy Tail, and even Avatar: The Last Airbender, you will most likely fall in love with this show. It focuses on the good and bad aspects of life, and the fact that just because you're a child doesn't mean you're weak of body and mind. I particularly loved the way they brought all the characters in and out of the show at times. The creative and unique plot was quite enjoyable for me. 
	The art was cartoony, but don't let that fool you. The movement was fluid and action scenes were breathtaking. I'm usually extremely picky about what art style I will and will not watch, but I made an exception for this show because I just couldn't put it down once I started. This brings me to the sound, which was also amazing. The opening sequence remained the same for all 148 episodes, which I thought was a touching tribute to the show (It made me cry at the end). The animation for the theme song is also quite good, showing off each of the four main character's personalities well. 
	The characters were amazing. I fell in love with each and every one of their quirks and odd personalities. Gon's friendly and light hearted personality will make you instantly happy every time he comes on screen, and Killua's cool, suave personality will excite you for the upcoming battle. The character development was also outstanding, as each one of them had a major change to undergo. It wasn't an instant revelation, though, as the show had plenty of time to age and mold the characters into believable people. They feel sad, frustrated, angry, cheery, jealous, and any other emotion a human could possibly possess. It was the withdrawal of the characters for me that made me feel desperate for a continuation of the show. 
	I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the show, something that I find trouble with. It did not disappoint me in any way, and I hope that anyone who reads this review will find pleasure in watching it as well. It's not easy to find an amazing work of art such as this, but as an action anime lover, I can happily say that I found a new favorite show in Hunter x Hunter.",10
"
                ""Don't judge a book by its cover,"" they always say, and that applies to this anime.
--------No spoilers---------
To be honest, before I watched this I judged this anime by its cover picture. I thought, ""Hmm... I see a lot of good comments on this, and it's popular... but it looks kiddish."" That was my first impression. I thought it was going to be stupid or it was going to be something like One Piece. I procrastinated to watch it. Then finally I got bored and wanted to try it out, I watched two episodes. Then six, then seven... then after a month or two I got
                  to episode 141 and stopped watching it for about three weeks because it was so good I didn't want it to end. Then finally I forced myself to finish it and the result was crying for the fifth time. 
If you judge by the cover like I did, think: Why is it rated R? Well sir/ma'am, it's because there is lots of blood. I mean... not like it's raining buckets, but like as half the characters in AN opening dies in different ways. They die by being eaten, beaten to death, or just get shot or something terrible. It's not THAT bloody, I mean not like Attack on Titan bloody, but sometimes it's a bit too much.
I'm not saying that Hunter x Hunter always seems like it's rated R, sometimes it seems like it's rated PG 13. A lot of scenes it really cute and adorable, but sometimes... not so much. Sometimes you just want to cry your eyes out or just punch the computer/TV/phone until your hands bleed.
------------------------
Overall: 10/10!
This is my new favourite anime. There are many who have loved this and I am one of them. It may be long but you just have to find the time to watch it. One complaint though: It has the same opening song every episode but different opening art (for opening song) every arc. 
Recommended:
I recommend this anime to people who love action/adventure anime.
Similar to:
Hunter x Hunter is similar to One Piece, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Fairy Tail, but nothing can't truly compare to the awesomeness of this anime.",10

                Best shonen anime i ever saw. Everything about it is superior to other anime.
Story - 10
Story follows adventure of two 12-years old boys around the world. While it may seem childish and stupid at start - story is actually really dark, which contrasts with show's artstyle.
Art - 10
This is MadHouse. Do i even need to say anything else? As i already said, there is a great contrast with dark story of the show.
Sound - 10
Sound is outstanding from show's OP to its ED including every single theme and voise actor choices(jap). I can't say more, you just have to hear it.
Character - 10
There are ALOT of outstanding characters, with somewhat of a main antagonist Hisoka leading them. Every character is fully developed through the show, everyone has own opinion and there are no actually annoing cahracters(for me, can't say fro someone else).
Enjoyment - 10
Every aspect of this show is Outstanding, dialogues are well-written, fights are well-directed and sound choices only add to their enjoyment.
Overall - 10
This IS the best shonen anime ever. I already told, why i love it and why 10 is well-deserved. Of course, everything is subjective and i may have told less than i should've said.
P.S. : Sorry, if you didn't understand something, writing in english is not my strong side.",10

                I remember the days when I would scroll through my Crunchyroll app, looking for good animes to watch, and I would come upon HunterXHunter. I remember examining the cover, disliking the way the show looked, and moving on without even reading the anime summary. I was missing out on so much. The only reason I'm grateful for my ignorance is because I was able to watch the whole anime all the way through without having to wait for the next episode. 
HunterXHunter is sorely underrated. Unless I activiely searched it up, or I became lucky, I'd never see anyone recommending it or even commenting about
                  it. I never saw a trace of anyone referring to it even. This might just be from my experience, but HXH seems to have been largely ignored. But I don't feel bad for the anime itself, I feel bad for the people missing out on it. I usually try not to profligate my opinion because I know everyone has a different taste, but this is just such a well-rounded show that I feel you'd have to really try to hate it. Onto the review.
I really understand why this anime is so underwatched. I'm talking from personal experience. Just one look at the cover and you see a generic shonen with odd-looking characters. This is the main reason I avoided it for so long. Next you see that it has 148 episodes. Immediately you think, ""That's way too long...it's just another run-on shonen...No thanks."" And you avoid it even more. But then one day you look at the top anime lineup on MAL and you notice it is within the top five most highly rated animes. You do a double-take. Suddenly you have to watch it.
And then you do. And what do you find?
An even more generic storyline than you thought it would be. Gon is a kid who wants to become a Hunter and find his dad, he can do things other people can't and is talented, he takes stupid risks and amazes the people around him...Oh heck no. This just screams ""I'm a long-running shonen anime, the main character is destined for greatness and he's going to go out on a never-ending journey to find his father, make new friends along the way and show up everyone else around him."" Yeah, I had the same exact thoughts. That's why after one episode I put it on hold for two months.
But then I read a review on MAL one day and decided to pick it up again, and what I found was something I thought I'd never find again- a masterpiece. For many many years, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was my all time favorite anime. But after watching HXH, I found that I couldn't decide between the two and now they are tied for first place. How did I have such a change of heart?
One of the things that makes this anime shine the most is its ability to destroy all of your expectations. Every time I thought I knew what was going to happen, this anime spun everything around and completely surprised me. I never quite knew what was coming next. 
Another thing I loved about this anime was its fights. No fight was boring, and more importantly, they were all filled with strategy. There were no annoying shonen fights where it basically goes like this: They encounter an enemy and go all out, trying so hard to defeat it, and the enemy is only a little scuffed up and they've ""only used 3%"" of their strength. The enemy then beats the crap out of them, and everyone seems to lose their spirit. But then they have an emotional speech about friendship/strength/love and they come up with a whole new powerful move on the spot and wipe out the enemy, who increasingly becomes more and more pathetic.
Yeah, that doesn't happen in HXH. Each battle is thought out and interesting. Also, a lot of battles are actually lost. I can't even count how many times Gon or someone else lost a fight. I remember seeing Gon laid up plenty of times, and no, he wasn't healed by the next episode, his injuries took actual time to heal. Also, people die. There is blood. Unlike Fairy tail, where I can count the number of deaths and appearances of blood on one of my hands, HXH doesn't hold back on either of those, but it doesn't go crazy on them either. (I'm not bashing oh FT, but just for the record it was one of my favorite animes until I watched HXH, then I realzied how...not amazing it was.)
Now onto the characters. They're all awesome, even the enemies. When I try to think of an enemy I hate, I can only think of one but even then he's only really a half-enemy and its my personal opinion on the character. Honesly, they are all amazing. I don't eve have any more to say about them, I've said all I needed to.
The art is great. I don't really pay attention to art usually but it's very nice to look at and it's consistently good.
I don't really pay attention to music, but a lot of it fits the mood perfectly when it plays and I enjoyed it as well.
This is just a little thing, but HXH only has two fillers which you can just skip.
Another great thing is the relationships. The relationships between the characters are enjoyable, especially between Gon and Killua. I admire how well all of the relationships are built, and they all just make you love the characters more. (Also, these same relationships are what caused me to cry on multiple occasions.)
This is getting lengthy so I'll just end it here. I give this show and everything in it a 10. It is a masterpiece and I have yet to find anything better than it. It may seem generic and cliche at first, but it isn't, and you won't regret watching more of it. If you watch this show and by the end of it you dislike it, I'd need to see a very detailed explanation to believe you. 
Watch this anime. I feel bad for people who haven't seen it yet.",10
"
                As one of the top rated animes surrounded by love and hype, I came into this anime expecting it to exceed many of it’s general shounen counterparts.  Although I’ve always enjoyed a good shounen, there are many tropes that often come up that drive me nuts from cliché drives to generically get stronger to drawn out battle sequences to power escalation issues.  Many in the genre are marred with these problems, but from what I’ve heard around the hype of Hunter x Hunter, I thought I might get a fun battle oriented anime that escapes these problems.  Then I watched Hunter x
                  Hunter.  
My first thought: is this an elaborate prank?
Not only does Hunter x Hunter fall into these tropes at various points in the show, Hunter x Hunter finds a new way to drive its viewer insane each episode from a drawn out overhyped dodgeball game to an insane and utterly absurd power surge in the main character for a side character we hardly get enough time to know and care about to main characters with such forgettable backgrounds that the show literally forgets about their existence for half the series.  At the end I was left confused by how anyone could watch this incoherent mess that felt like sitting through an 11 year old’s DnD campaign.
The story follows through five main archs and two sub archs. In the beginning, I wasn’t actually upset too much about the show.  The first arch is a cute generic examination arch where are four protagonists are fighting for their hunter’s license.  Although there is nothing strikingly novel and unique about this arch, the story is enjoyable enough to follow through and there are a handful of moments truly entertaining that keep you hooked. 
One of my early issues for the show does pop up in the early episodes in the character designs.  Individually each character looks fine.  However as the characters line up, I find it painfully hard to see how they all belong in the same anime.  Not only are there designs wildly different, but even the stylization of how they are drawn doesn’t seem to match. I could go on for hours about the problematic character lineup that appears in this show, but this isn’t a character design review so I’ll keep it brief. Some have different stylized line weights to their outlines while others follow vastly different color pallets.  Characters look like they’re plucked from all different animes/mangas from Jo Jo’s Bizarre Adventure to Cowboy Bebop.  This problem becomes much stronger as you follow through the show and more outrageous character designs occur, especially in the final arch with the zodiacs.  Although with that said, I do have to give it to the anime/manga,the designs are unique.  Not in a good way, but they are unique.
The second sub story archs allow our main characters to grow stronger (falling into the power up shounen trop) and allow us to learn more about one of the main character’s (and probably my favorite character, Killua) background story.  Here is one of the brighter spots in the anime as we find the show for the first time truly take a shot at world building around the Zoldyck family rather than follow the vague mess of a world they had before.  In the arena arch we are finally introduced to the magic system of the show which is awkwardly thrown in and never even referred to in the first several episodes of the anime.  The magic system of Hunter x Hunter is not unique or anything special, but it functions (somewhat) for the anime and fills its role well enough.
The second large plot revolves around another main character, Kurapika.  Again this plot is fairly generic telling of a revenge arch, but it’s interesting enough and the use of the magic system in this plot is actually interesting and somewhat novel.  The ending of this plot, however, is the start of this shows downfall from generic and bland Shonen to unbearably bad disaster.
The next two main archs are bad for different reasons.  The first of these is the Greed Island arch where are mains leave the large city of Yorknew City (Yes, I know how wonderful their worldbuilding names are 🙃).  We get a new system separate from the main magic system of insane cards where I feel like I was slapped into a Yu Gi Oh knockoff (as if the original anime wasn’t bad enough).  The plot quickly becomes so contrived and the new magic system is so complicated and useless to the rest of the anime that I almost dropped the anime here.  But I didn’t and I suffered through the epic battle that this arch leads you two.  The epic, multiple episode long dramatic life and death game of... dodgeball... I’m not sure I need to say much more here.  
After that we get into a several episodes setting up our next story arch that might have been my favorite large arch.  Although the premise of this arch is a bit far fetched, it’s over all concept is interesting and engaging and its execution was surprisingly well crafted and conveyed in comparison to the rest of the anime.  Of course by now we have already lost two of our main characters forgotten back in Yorknew City and are flooded with another set of strange and incoherent character designs.  However, despite this I actually could get on board with this arch.  Well until it’s ending where we literally spent multiple episodes just for 10 seconds of the epic battle.  This arch ends in the worst example of a drawn out shounen battle I’ve ever seen before.  I’d take the ridiculously long battles of Bleach over this arch’s epic battle.  Not to mention our lovely little Gon goes from short shorts to booty shorts in his ridiculously contrived power up over the death of a sub character he had only met twice in his life.  This sweet cinnamon roll of a character does such a strong 180 in just a few episodes that it almost seems unbelievable and ruins all attempts to make his power up scene emotional.  With that said, however, the best moment of this entire anime occurs at the end of the battle in a heavily emotionally charged scene between the Ant King, Meruem, and Komugi.
Finally we move to the final and hardest story arch to get through as we finally get a proper definition of a hunter outside of a generic action adventure hero who can travel anywhere he wants.  This isn’t a good thing though as the majority of the plot is the most dull and obnoxious display of never ending bureaucracy.  There is an interesting subplot going on between Killua and his family, but honestly I regret wasting my time actually watching this plot.  Even at the end when we have a ‘happy moment’ when Gon finally accomplishes is major goal, I just feel bitter and I’m sorry, but I hate Gon’s dad. 
In the end this anime is mediocre at it’s point and almost entirely unwatchable at its worst.  It’s hard for me to justify giving it anything above a 4. The one thing pulling me through the horrendous plots and unbearably uncomfortable Hisouka moments is the dynamics of Gon and Killua’s relationship.  Their friendship is surrounded by cute interactions and the two characters play off each other really well, although it’s hard to deny the romantic underpinnings behind Killua’s crush for Gon. It is my favorite part of this otherwise awful anime. 
My final thoughts are this anime might be alright to have playing in the background from time to time and does have some genuinely enjoyable moments, but overall it is not worth wasting the hours to.  But of course this is my own opinion.  If you enjoy it, go ahead and continue to watch the anime. Sadly this anime is not one for me.",3

                When it comes to an anime based on finding a lost parent, i give a usual thought of ""meh"". This storyline has been used and beaten so much it's dating Chris Brown. And to my surprise Hunter x Hunter was highly rated on MAL, so I thought heck, YOLO. Now I love the lost parent storyline with all my heart and issue a sincere apology.
Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a remake of the same anime of the 90s, it follows the story of Gon Freecs, an aspiring Hunter who wants to find his father, who too is a hunter. Gon teams up with Killua, and
                  with added help from Kurapika and Leorio become hunters to achieve their own goal.
With regards to the story, as previously stated, this anime has a bread and butter objective, to find Gon's dad. As it's a shounen anime, the usual themes of friendship, perseverance, comedy and not mention epic fighting are included, as well as being relationship driven in areas. Furthermore, it's separated into (according to it's own wiki) 7 arcs, but primarily it's 6 that's the main focus. 5 of those 6 arcs have the main objective weaved inside them, making sure each arc has a main purpose. Although it seems simple, many anime's over 100+ episodes loose its focus on that matter. The atmosphere starts to change within each arc from suspense in the Hunter exam arc, to a thriller in the York-New auction arc and to a have a detailed analysis on the theory of evolution in the Chimera Ant arc.  Also, plot lines can change from character driven to action packed. Training is constantly prevalent in the show, with each character trying to increase their strength regularly. Strategic fights can be strenuously complicated, similar to a game of chess in how the characters defeat their opponent. What's best about that is that they keep it entertaining by reaching a middle ground between epic and calculated. But there's a catch. The main characters don't win every fight, in fact, the lose many times. This therefore adds more of an emphasis for training to become better.
However, Hunter x Hunter does come with its flaws. For example, this is a reboot of the 90s Hunter x Hunter, this lead to a whole new cast being made, which could anger those who liked the older voice acting. Furthermore, it took 2 less episodes for the Hunter exam arc to start in this version than the previous one, so some dialogue had been cut out. Furthermore, some build up can be misconstrued as stalling for time, making it very boring. However, when the build up is fine right, it will make the experience of watching it that much better.
In terms of animation, the rebooted show is definitely no slouch. The sharp graphics are certainly nice on the eye, and fighting animations are very much fluid. The character models themselves are similar to it's predecessor, but nicer on the eye. Gon's usually stereotypical German youth outfit is still a dazzling green as usual. All in all, the detail is very good.
Regarding the characters of Hunter x Hunter, there's only 2 characters to talk about. Gon and Killua's relationship is very much like the ying and yang complex, with each character being 2 sides to the same coin. Killua's more mature, whereas Gon is more childish and blunt in his ways. Although it can look simple, each character does contain a dark side to them, even though it isn't a true representative of their true personality. Overall, the relationship is very much like a loving brotherly relationship. In terms of character development, we see distinct attitudes to the two characters and a clear view of how the characters are based on the past. Furthermore, the many episodes also show distinct contrasts in comparison to the earlier episodes as to how the characters develop.
With regards to Kurapika and Leorio, each have similar traits to Gon and Killua, but unfortunately haven't received as much screen time,  but the screen time they were given showed their personalities well. 
With regards to music, I'm not a massive fan of the opening and ending songs, not many have tickled my fancy as stunning moving pieces of music. The OST however does get a thumbs up, as not only can it be lighthearted, but it can easily intensify the atmosphere in thriller and suspense moments.
To conclude, for an anime which ended on an incredibly high note, I hope I see another series of Hunter x Hunter in the coming years. I do recommend this to those who want to see Shounen at its best.",10
"
                I was a massive fan of Hunter x Hunter as a child, I watched the Arabic dub of the 1999 version and although it was quite censored (I don't remember Killua ripping out anyone's heart when I watched it) it was still gripping. So when I discovered that it was being remade, I went about binge watching to catch up and within four days, I caught up to the anime which was at episode 127 at the time.
Since the show was practically over and I'd already read the manga (I know I know, I should have known about the anime sooner) I was ready to
                  give it a 10/10 at that very moment that I finished episode 126, if you've seen the show then you know why it's this specific episode that triggered that response. There is not a single wasted moment in HxH 2011, with the exception of the early recap episode. Togashi crafts an absolute masterpiece with less focus on world building - the world map in this show is the actual world map flipped upside down- but rather the characters. Don't be fooled by the childish, forever smiling, happy go lucky 11 year old Gon Freeccs that we are introduced to in the beginning. As the story progresses, we follow an ever evolving, ever changing character that is unrecognizable by the end of the series. 
Character development is where this show outshines more or less every anime I've ever come across. Even the antagonists ( I won't refer to them as villains because that would be doing Togashi a disservice) are written in such a way that you find it hard not to empathize with their cause. The way that Togashi explores characters and delves into their thoughts and motives is what makes this show stand out. The two main characters, Gon and Killua, are introduced as a certain anime trope/stereotype but steadily and surely Togashi slowly deconstructs your view of them and rebuilds them in an entirely new light. Each is the perfect foil to the other and while Gon starts out as the one keeping Killua in check, at the end it's Killua laying his life on the line to protect Gon. This isn't done in such a manner that you notice it happening, it isn't as someone flicked a switch and changed the characters' psychological state and for this reason the story benefits greatly.
The actual story is on another level to your average fodder (of course it is, this show wouldn't be exceptional otherwise). The world of the Hunter Association is fascinating and well constructed. The system in place seems almost barbaric when you're first watching the exam phase but as more and more professional hunters make their debut in the show, it becomes evident why this gruelling and extremely selective system is in place. Much like the characters, the story itself is just as deceiving. It seems like a simple enough tale of a son searching for his estranged father but goes on to explore themes such as revenge, sacrifice, human malice, evolution, identity crisis and many more very mature themes. Human malice especially is a constantly present theme that is developed further in every arc, culminating in the Chimera Ant arc which is perhaps the shows strongest, most mature arc. Even the ""boss fights"" for lack of a better term are entirely different to other animes. Without going too heavily into any spoilers, there isn't a single antagonist who is defeated with your typical 'friendship powerup by the main character'. Every antagonist is beaten by a carefully laid out plan with much thought and heavy planning by the protagonist and their comrades. While the final arc is much less action and all dialogue, it provides a great ending to a show that seemed like it was nonstop action for 135 episodes.
With respect to the production, Madhouse deserves all the praise that they've received. The voice acting in particular stands out especially in heavily emotional scenes, episode 116 in particular is a stand out. The animation is more or less consistent throughout the entire show and only delineates from the mean when the animation quality is particularly outstanding such as episodes 126 and 131. The soundtrack is excellent and never seems out of play or over the top. It has a wide range of music from very intense, drum heavy music to some astonishingly fitting classical pieces.
Hunter x Hunter is without a shadow of a doubt the most mature show of its kind that I've personally seen and undeniably the best anime of its length. The fact that it is able to keep up that level of quality over 148 episodes is a credit to Togashi's unparalleled story writing and character building.

                Let me start this review by saying that this is one of the worst, if not the worst anime shows I have ever seen. My attention was stretched so thin by the end that I quit before watching the last arc. I am going to try and keep the spoilers at the absolute minimum. I can already imagine how many Hunter x Hunter (2011) fans are going to be mad at me for saying this. (I'll just refer to Hunter x Hunter (2011) as Hunter x Hunter from now on. The show is lacking in many different departments. The story is bland and standard, the
                  art is decent, the combat being pretty good, the sound felt out of place many times. The characters were stale and bland with no development, and it really wasn't enjoyable at all. Overall, a solid 3.
story:3
art:5
sound:3
character:1
enjoyment:2
overall:3
Let us start with the story category:
STORY (3):
The plot of the story takes up many forms and tries to mix up different genres during the arcs. Some of the core ideas are pretty interesting like the first arc, but the execution and pacing were extremely lacking. There were 4 episodes of the characters just walking and getting through just the first section of the tournament. I wouldn't consider this as well-executed. The plot seems so stretched out to the point that I think that the first arc could just be condensed into a few episodes.
The story itself seems very unrelated between the sections of the show making it feel more like a separate show every-time always switching out the characters, I'll get back to that in the Character section. The plot wasn't really engaging as I only found it intriguing when it was introduced and I began to become tired of the plot and core idea of it. Also, I really felt no journey watching the story as nothing progressed and they were just distracted with something else.
Overall, if executed properly, it would receive a better score, but it felt way too stretched without the parts being connected in any way.
ART (5):
The art was pretty good during the battle scenes, character design, and scenery, but I felt like it was lazy in the other parts of the anime. Even during fight scenes, the background was completely forgotten about and was blurred out. Especially during useless, boring scenes not even during the battles, all the attention was drawn to the characters, and only the characters not on anything else. This made the scenes even more unbearable as there was nothing cool to look at except for the characters which you have scene so many times before. I don't blame them for doing this during the battle sequences because the attacks were the main focus. The background always seemed bland not fitting for the situation. The show obviously wanted to focus on the characters, but they themselves were really bad. 
Overall, the art was the best part of the series especially during the battle sequences making it interesting and captivating to watch. Everywhere else, I felt the art was lacking and was too focused on the characters.
SOUND (3):
The sound really didn't fit in during many scenes. I felt like some of the instrumental choices weren't fitting as well. Also, a quick statement, do you hear the laziness during the OPs? The melody is the same and the only things that are altered are the notes by a bit and the words. If you take the OPs of a show like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, there is a very big diversity between all of them. There is a good balance between sad parts of the OP and epic music. Though the OP of Hunter x Hunter is pretty catchy you get tired of it after watching a couple of episodes. The actual soundtrack doesn't really stand out at all, and seems unnecessarily loud or quite at times drawing away attention, or not having enough of a presence. It felt bland at times. 
Overall, the soundtrack was misplaced/misused, and it didn't fit the situation.
CHARACTER (1):
The obvious let down to the whole show. The characters were really bland and unchanging and I felt that most of the characters were left out after being important for a few episodes. The characters were like disposable tissues which only lasted a few times before being thrown away completely. Some of the most memorable and interesting characters were present for only a couple of episodes and didn't come back until a couple dozen episodes later. 
Now let me talk about my biggest problem, Gon. This character is so bland, so unchanging, it ruins everything. I can't see a single thing that changed for Gon during the whole series. The reason people like him so much is due to his personalities which don't ever determine whether or not the character is great. Here, the main character who we have to put up with (with his annoying personality), has no change throughout the series remaining the friend-loving, and friend-caring person he is. The only possible thing I can see, is he became less and less naive throughout the series. This is just a feeble excuse for change in characters, and in no way should this be the only changing part of the character. His main personality traits stay the same throughout making you feel less and less related to the the character, and in result not caring for them, or anything that happens. The complexity of the character is awful.
Now, Killua, another horribly made, and non-changing character. Killua really doesn't change at all, as he is always serious and only undergoes change during the Zoldyck family arc which is quickly reversed after the arc. I can't stress enough how little these characters tend to change being unaffected by the current situations. The complexity of Killua was mediocre in the terms of this show. The complexity is important for the watcher to feel relatable to the characters, or to give them something to think about.
Now, Kurapika and Leorio. What can I say, we got way too little of them as they completely vanished from the series after a couple of dozen episodes. The themselves are decent people to work with, giving more opportunity for change. It's such a shame that every side character was thrown out of the window every few episodes creating a place where it was virtually impossible for the characters to undergo even the slightest bit of change. Leorio wasn't that interesting of a character, and didn't change at all. The complexity of his character was really bad as he had only one or two defining traits and that's it. Kurapika is such a stereotypical survivor of a traumatic accident concerning his village. His personality isn't explored other than the fact that it is given his tendency for revenge is very high. I don't think that's enough to create a character to sympathize for. The complexity, very bad.
ENJOYMENT (2):
While watching, I felt bored and really felt like everything was stretched out. Especially during certain parts where all they did was talk about how to do things. (I'm not being specific because of spoilers). These talking scenes are done in a very bland and a very un-intriguing fashion causing the scenes to feel unneeded, and boring all of the time. If there was something you could look at that caught your eye's during these scenes it wouldn't be as painful. The plot was moving at such an incredibly slow rate that feeling like you are wasting your time was inevitable. The characters make the show even more unbearable to watch as there is nothing interesting to learn about them, or their personality. These personalities are so bland and unchanging, which creates no interest in actually watching it. By the end my patience was cut dry and I quit after watching a large chunk of the show.
OVERALL(3):
I really didn't like many aspects of the show, especially what I find the most important, story and character. These really brought down the series and I must admit, the potential was there. The execution on the other hand was surely lacking. The sound felt out of place in many sections, but the art was truly the best part, though it didn't do that well. I feel like the story was stretched out so much, making it feel like the average shounen like Naruto or Dragon Ball Z which have hundreds of episodes, and from what I heard no change in anything. The art was good, but lazy at parts when drawing the background itself. It drew away the attention to the characters. The sound was fine it just felt out of place. I think the basic mentality in the heads of the people in charge with the sound track just thought, ""Let's just put epic music during fight scenes"". This doesn't always work like this because the choice of instruments is essential in creating music that blends with the scenes. The sound just felt way too out of place and not thought out. The characters was the obvious weak part as there was nothing interesting to learn from the characters, and no change to observe other than an increase in strength. Also, the characters that have the potential to change and could be interesting are just thrown away after a few episodes of being used. The ones left are always Gon and Killua making you feel very tired of them. they themselves had no interest in changing and stayed the dull characters they were. They really only had one or two leading character traits and had nothing else to them.
I wish to tell everyone, that if you look closely, this show is pretty bad. It is lacking in many different parts, and there are so many other shows that handle these problems in a much better fashion. The characters are awful, and the plot is way too stretched out, which causes boredom while watching. Just think about the series after watching and realize how bad it is at handling these categories.
Thank you,

                -Spoiler Alert, Read at own risk-
""If you want to get to know someone, find out what makes them angry.""
-Gon Freecss
I'm angry because of the hiatus of this anime, and that makes me an otaku. xD
but I wish Togashi could get better so he can continue writing hxh, and plus he can't write 100% if he force himself to write while sick, I want at it 100% reading the manga and anime. I think he is one of the best writers out there, his other masterpiece yuyu hakusho. This is one hell of an anime it is consistent of every aspect. What's great about this anime
                  is that the equal time of feeling in it. The time to hate, the time to love, and the time to be happy. 
The first time I watch this was like ughhh, another typical shounen anime shiznit. I felt like I was gonna drop it in the first episode. But then I just kept pressing the next button and the next. The next thing I knew I was already singing the opening song. Really I hate myself for hating this anime at first. It must be a shounen manga but a shounen manga you have never seen before!
-Story 11-
The story 11 but cant give 11 here. At first you might think the flow of the story has no complexity just about a kid who sets out on a journey to find the reason why his father abandoned him to be a hunter. But then he meets this 3 people, one who swore revenge, one who desire riches and one who wants to be released. The four of them together take the hunter exam, and this were this gets serious ""Nen"" its like an life energy which in chinese called ""Chi"" similar to chakra. The complexity almost makes you think how can a human think of these? Thousands of fighting styles can be made if you know how to use nen. It is so creative. This is just outstanding no need to say more spoilers just watch it and you will learn why I gave this 11. 
Character developement, flashbacks, flow of the story. It was delivered how Togashi wanted it supposed to be. And that what makes Togashi the one of the best writers. Seriously  it made me cry, happy, angry, and fell in love with the story of each characters.
-Art 10-
The art is magnificent. Character design, backgrounds, and powers. It is well detailed, This is what amazing about madhouse, it was consistent considering this was a long term anime. It is pleasing to the eye. It is cute when you look at it, what makes it good that it is a little childish. If it were more adult looking it thing the show would go gore and horror. I think it is amazing colorful, bright but not to bright well balanced art. It's something you can display on an art museum.
-Sound 10-
The sound is good but gets better and better when you watch it. The soundtrack in the fighting scenes were the best of the best. It get me get of my feet and feel like rocky. Man, feel like I'm the one fighting. The seiyuu was great, it really fits the art perfectly.
-Character 10-
Character oh characters, I don't even no where to begin. Should I begin with the protagonist or the antagonist? Im gonna start with the protagonist, the four protagonist really stroke there story in ma heart *cry* I mean the reasons why they want to be a hunter. Those characters really, they have a special something in themselves not all protagonist has that. It's makes you feel like you the protagonist it self. 
The antagonist is well the reason why this story is sosososo goooood! You just can't hate them. Hisoka, Phantom troupe, Meruem what other characters are like them? I don't know how to feel about them, should I hate or love? Damn!
-Enjoyment 10-
I don't even need to talk about these, should I? I wanted to sleep but I can't, I tell my self another lie ""last episode"" but then realize that I was doing it again. I even pass out in my desktop watching this anime. It was fun even though got stiff neck it was worth! It is enjoyable, worth 148 episode but hoping for more!
-Overall Over9000-
Yeah, you know exaggerating. but at every aspect of this anime it never cease to amaze me. I recommend this if you want to watch a not to mainstream shounen anime. This is a masterpiece. I hope there will be more, T_T I am waiting for you Master Togashi!",10

                Ooooh my goooood. OOOOOOOOH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD.
If you're having doubts about watching Hunter x Hunter 2011, don't. Watch it. Like, right now. The amount of work put into this series, this franchise, really shows. I honestly cannot think of one thing wrong with this series, besides how sad it gets. (Killua deserved better ;;)
Let's start with story.
The plot seems bland, reading the synopsis on MAL and Netflix. However, this bland setup makes the series really shine where it should. Gon is a 12 year-old boy who's searching for his long-lost father. Yawn, boring right? Not at all. If you think the plot is boring or cliche
                  just from the first couple episodes or the first season or what your friends say, force yourself through it. The progression of the story and its attention to detail make for a smooth and plothole-less experience. Every little moment is taken into account by Togashi and Madhouse and not a single plot device is left forgotten. The handle on story really makes this story enjoyable, even if every other area was mediocre. That is, IF. Every other area also got a 10/10.
Next is art.
Madhouse truly gave us eyecandy when producing this anime. The art reflects a typical shounen style, but gives us something else underneath, something that even now, I can't quite name. Not to mention Madhouse perfectly captures aging and stress, something that all four main characters are exposed to. The expressions leave me breathless, honestly, just how amazing these characters always look. The animation is stunning. It flows so well, you'd think it were a Western cartoon if you didn't know any better. The fight scenes are spectacular, and the gore is realistic but not over-the-top. You can find similar Madhouse majesties in Death Parade and Parasyte: The Maxim, just to name a couple. If you're looking for excellent art and subtle character growth expressed through the designs, HxH is the way to go.
Now, sound.
The opening of HxH never changes (good thing it's an excellent song). The song remains the same, though it switches through different parts of the full song, and the visuals change through the varying arcs. The opening is always, always aesthetically pleasing to the eye and really shows each arc the way they are meant to be shown. Some are darker than others, and it reflects the feel of each arc very well. The OST sends shivers down my spine and oooh god I get chills just thinking about it. The ending songs do change, and oh man do they change. Each one, once again, changes according to arc, and I can't pick a favorite. Madhouse, once again, pleases us with its attention to detail, even in the ending credits. I could look up the HxH OST and listen to it for days.
Aaaand then there's characters.
I can't even think about the main characters without tearing up. They all go through such tragedies in their own ways. Gon, who grew up sheltered with his family, finally experiences pain and agony throughout the course of the series, and it really changes him. Killua, the good kid with a bad upbringing who only wants to make a friend. Kurapika, whose entire family, everything he'd ever known, was massacred. Leorio grew up in poverty and lost his very best friend to an illness, and now only wants to give medical care for those who can't afford it. They all go through hardships and trauma, and their development in response to that makes them stronger characters. Some even have negative character development, where it's excellent development in a not-so-optimal direction (no spoilers, but it's excellently portrayed and it's very realistic, unlike many shounen out there). The side characters are also incredible. The antagonists range from questionably bad to disgusting garbage. The Chimera Ant arc really shows the show's true nature as far as darkness and existentialism. It plays with some very touchy themes, but never over-does it. Talking about representation, this show is very diverse in its ethnicities, like with Canary and Squala, and even LGBTQ+ inclusion. Pitou, for example, is genderless, and Alluka Zoldyck is a trans girl. It made my experience a lot better knowing that there were such relatable characters even to the extent of appearance and gender. It's representation presented realistically, and not so over-the-top in-your-face like some other franchise do.
As for my enjoyment, it without question gets a 10/10.
This series is so amazing in the fact that it has such a wide audience capability. Of course, a shounen's target audience is always younger boys, but Togashi really manages to capture a different audience, the audience being everybody. It's a shame this anime isn't more popular in Western cultures, because I think everybody and their mother deserves to enjoy this series and what it has to offer. There's always a character to relate to and so many tear-jerkers that I had to pause the episode because I couldn't read the subs through my tears. No character gets off completely scott-free after a major event or battle, and while it's sad, it's realistic. I never cried harder over an anime than at the end of the Chimera Ants arc. I'm very glad I decided to watch this series, because even I had my doubts.
The series ended because it caught up to the manga, which is currently on hiatus with Togashi's health issues. It ended in a phenomenal way, and though some parts of the anime diverged from the manga, it was never enough to affect the plot, mostly just things switched here and there. The anime series is likely on hiatus with the manga, until the manga begins to update regularly again (whenever that may be.) (Togashi come back to us.) (I love you.).
TL;DR, do yourself a favor and watch HxH.",10

                I'm about to say something that is going to be taken way more literal than it really means: Hunter x Hunter is the most overrated anime I've watched so far. Now I know what you are thinking: ""Wow this dude must think it's absolute garbage let's bombard him with messages telling him how he couldn't process the complexity and masterful writing of Hunter x Hunter."" I already see it in my close future. But I want to clear up, no I do not think Hunter x Hunter is bad. Far from it, considering i'm not the biggest fan of shonen I actually decently enjoyed this
                  show. But the reason for it being the most overrated is because of the praise it got. The only thing that was in my head when I started Hunter x Hunter was ""Top 5 anime of all time"" and ""Best shonen to date."" Unfortunately after my journey and now finishing Hunter x Hunter I can say it is neither of those. That 9.12 it has is in my opinion undeserving and is extremely overrated and overhyped. HOWEVER, I did enjoy the very beginning and end of Hunter x Hunter and it is still a very pleasing anime so do not get me wrong. But please understand, I only think it's very overrated because of the extreme mass approval it got before going into it.
Story: 6.5
This is probably my most controversial opinion on Hunter x Hunter. The story is pretty generic and follows almost every shonen troupe and I don't know why it gets such mass approval. I think people confuse good world building with plot/story. They are not the same thing. Sure if this was for World Building, I would give it an 8.5-9/10. But as far as the story goes, it is really hard for me to see how it isn't cliched at the very least. I'll go ahead and rank all the arcs so you can see what I gave the story fleshed out.
Hunter Exam Arc: 8/10
Zoldyck Family Arc (Idk if this was considered an arc but): 7.5/10
Heaven's Arena: 5/10
York New City Arc: 7/10
Greed Island: 6/10
Chimera Ant Arc: 7.5/10
Election Arc: 7.5/10
The narrator and the over-explanation of nen almost put me to sleep multiple times in Heavens Arena and I thought it was very poorly done. In my opinion the Hunter Exam was my favorite arc and I thought it was very well done. The rest of the arcs were pretty average and that includes the dreaded Chimera Ant Arc. People would not shut up about the Chimera Ant Arc calling it one of the best arcs in all of anime. It's not even the best arc in Hunter x Hunter... I only liked the Chimera Ant Arc when it was post rose meruem, other than that it was ok. I just don't see how the story isn't pretty generic with a lot of shonen troupes. Kid has family issues so he sets out on a journey to solve said family issue and meets a side character and gets random power ups with a main villain group doing villainy stuff. It's good world building, not plot.
Art: 8
Nothing to complain about here as per usual, art was fine.
Sound: 7
I swear they have only 4 songs in total to choose from, I hear that stupid drum set song every damn episode.
Characters: 7.5
Now don't get me wrong, this 7.5 is completely because of the supporting characters. I am not a fan of Gon and Killua. I don't know how people think they are good characters. Gon is as generic as any shonen mc and Killua is just as generic as any shonen side character but add crying and blushing when people say anything to him. The main reason for my lack of enjoyment for the series would have to be Gon and Killua. They just did not sit well for me and their chemistry was almost gay like. I actually thought they would kiss each other in a couple scenes, i'm not joking. Kurapika and Leorio were way more enjoyable than those 2 and i'm glad the manga isn't about them anymore. The Phantom Troupe barely had any screen time for me to make a judgment about them, they were in York New, like 2 episode in Greed Island and 2 episodes in Chimera and thats it. The supporting characters were awesome though, loved them.
Enjoyment: 6
I really only enjoyed the beginning of the show and then pretty much all of the middle was a snooze fest until it got good at the very end. I just fail to recognize this as one of the best cause I personally didn't get that experience most people did. There are some things in this anime that I ponder why it was hyped up to be so good. The Phantom Troupe were all pretty generic and had 0 backstories. Before I watched it people were comparing the Phantom Troupe to the Akatsuki and such. I just needed more of what they stopped showing and less of what they were putting out. I wanted more Leorio and Kurapika and Phantom Troupe not Gon, Killua and the rest. 
Overall: 6
I really wanted to be blown away by this anime considering what it was hyped up to be but instead I was saying ""Thats it?"" by the end. Disappointing.",6

                I know I'm a little late to the party here, but I have just recently finished the Hunter X Hunter 2011 anime. At first I went into this show expecting your typical long-running Shounen Jump series, but let me say now that I have never been happier to be so wrong.
Where do I even begin with this amazing show? There are so many different aspects to it that all deserve their own individual praise. However, I will try to keep this review short and to the point.
The story follows a young boy named Gon, who's goal is to go out and find his father, who
                  left him shortly after he was born to become a Hunter. Gon believes that if he can follow in his father's footsteps by also becoming a Hunter, he would have a higher chance of seeing him. In the beginning, the show presents itself as somewhat lighthearted and joyful, but don't be fooled. As the story progresses, it becomes signicantly more and more darker and grittier, even to the point where you'll question if this is even still a shounen.
The characters, in my opinion, are the show's strong point. Each individual person has solid, realistic, and believable personalities that really showcase what kind of character they truly are. The four main protagonists are some of the most easily likeable and relatable protagonists I have ever seen in ANY anime, not just shounen. It's definetly hard to not get attached to them. There is no lack of character development either, no character will be the same by the time you finish the last episode. I would dive deeper into this aspect, but that would require spoiler talk.
As far as animation, art, and sound quality go, they're as amazing as you would expect of an anime like this. More than half of the time, the animation is perfectly fluent, though it is never an eyesore. The art style definitely varies throughout the show, going from ""amazing"" to ""meh."" In no way is it ever terrible though. However, something that does remain brilliant  throughout the entirety of the show is the soundtrack, which kicks ass!!! The opening song is immediately catchy from the first time you hear it, and the fact that its the only one the show  has gives it a sense of identity. You know that this is THE theme song for Hunter X Hunter. The instrumental themes and orchestrated pieces that play during the show are where its really at though. I could literally gush over the OST for days straight, and here's why. Each theme is perfectly crafted to tug at every kind of emotion within the viewer. They are placed at the perfect moments in the show that they were made for, and create massive, unique impacts on the audience, especially during more emotional and intense moments. Happy moments become joyful, exciting moments become exhilarating, and sad/emotional moments become beautiful and heart breaking. There's not much more to say really, its good stuff.
One more thing I want to point out before I come to my conclusion, is the voice acting. As of the time this review was made, this show does not yet have an English Dub, so naturally, I will be discussing the Japanese voice acting, which is incredible. Every character has perfectly fitting voices to acompany them, and their performances are all outstanding. Particually the voice actress for Gon in a certain point in the show you will surely recognize if you do decide to watch this near-masterpiece of a series.
I could continue to ramble on and on about how much I love this anime, but I don't want to take up anymore of your time. If you've watched it, you know exactly what I'm talking about. If you haven't, then what the hell are you doing?! Go watch it right now! I can guarantee you will not regret it.
Final Score: 9.75/10",9

                I love the story line of hunter x hunter. i wish for more seasons of it and i hope the Dark continental expedition will be put into anime soon. The main characters are awesome, each has a story and goals. the Characters are great, and i could say that Togashi really had a great work in doing the Ant Chimera Arc. 10/10 rate for me in all its arc. =) This is the only anime a watched from 1st to its latest episode because i found the story more adventurous than other anime (only in my opinion). Now what makes Hunter x Hunter my favorite
                  anime of all..
1. I like the characters, they are well drawn. Gon is adorable, Killua is cute, Leorio is uhmm nice and Kurapika is pretty even though he'a a ""HE"". Also, all characters are well made
2. It adopts modern technology. OMG i had watched the 1991 episode of Hunter x Hunter and it really evolved, now they were able to use smart phones and tablets, LED screen computers its like.. AWESOME!! it seems like they are in the real world... XoX LOL i just love the way they have those techy thing.
3. Though its some kinda violent i like the way they kill characters.. LOL looks weird huh! lots of bloody death, cutting of body parts specially those limbs.. well i haven't seen a lot of anime who lost limbs in a duel, specially the main character.. oh well its only found in Hunter x Hunter i think. So many killings in this anime, even brutally killing of a child by the chimera ants, eating of humans by the chimera ant queen looks kinda disgusting eh specially on what they did on Pokkle and Ponzu really really brutal. and oh i almost forgot, the head of kite cutted by Pitou..
4. Oh those touching moments it makes me cry out loud.. specially on the ant chimera arc where Gon cried a lot when he found out that kite is dead and cannot be revived by Pitou, the death of Chairman Netero and the last game of Meruem with Kumogi.. T.T it really crushes my heart.
5. Zoldyck family is so cool.. They are a family of assassin and they were really really popular on their business. They lived in a mountain so high.. oh they are just so cool.. This what makes Killua a cool rich kid / assassin.
6. A lot of anime are fed up with too many duel/fights, although it may not be controlled as this fights really make a thrill.. Hunter x Hunter has a lot of adventure rather than a duel or maybe i could call it an adventure fight. Like on the Chimera ant arc. Hunter exam arc is more of an adventure thing less fighting more of like a mind game, so as in Chimera ant arc. 
7. Gon is really the good kid who can't even kill but i was so shocked during his fight with Pitou, ohw well, usually as observed in other anime, the main character fights the villain  for 3 or more episodes but wow, Gon did it in 1 episode only  that was so fast. 
8. The main character doesn't have to fight the boss villain. yea right. this is Hunter x Hunter.  Remember in the York New City Arc when Kurapika should be the one who will fight Chrollo for revenge but it turns out to be Silva and Zeno Zoldyck vs Chrollo because they were hired by the Ten Dons and on the Chimera ant arc, its Mereum Vs. Netero. 
9. Characters admits defeat and the main characters doesn't have to fight all the villain like on the chimera ant arc, they have an assigned fight for each villain. e.g. Knuckle and Shoot fight with Youpi and Morel Vs. Pouf.. whats good in this is that they always come up with a teamwork =)
All of praise to Hunter x Hunter, I still have a lot of praise in my mind.. but ill save it for another review.. =)",10
"
                After Togashi wrote his more traditional Shonen series with actual climaxes and arcs, Hunter X Hunter is largely nothing but constant subversion with a refusal to bring anything to a satisfying conclusion. Characters and villains are constantly tossed aside after having been built up with no conclusion to their arcs, such as the majority of villains and even half of the so called ""main characters"".
If villains are ever actually addressed and defeated, the majority of the time it will be done without any kind of fight in a blatant cop out. Most of the arcs have little to no continuity between each other as they
                  get rid of early side protagonists, and any instances of recurring villains such as Hisoka and the Phantom Troupe are irrelevant to the plot.
The only constant characters available to follow are Gon and Killua. Gon is largely just generic while Killua gets most of the characterization. His character consists of being incredibly edgy due to his upbringing who wins practically every fight effortlessly, while still trying to appeal to viewers as an arbitrary ""cute"" kid interacting with Gon. It takes over 30 episodes for Killua to even be hit by any kind of attack, and over 40 for him to actually lose.
Only in the Chimera Ant arc, which starts in episode 76, does the series actually begin to resemble a traditional Shonen and manage to build up some good and interesting characters. Almost all of these characters are completely new or had very little appearances, with the only real carryovers being Gon and Killua who aren't particularly relevant to the plot anymore, with the best episodes being ones where they barely appear. This arc has actual good fights and interesting abilities used in clever ways, after the series has been doing its best to avoid them for the past 75 episodes.
While I could recommend this series for the first half of this arc, at the point where the heroes invade the villain's palace the series slows to a crawl. From this point on, the series has terrible pacing issues with an obnoxious narrator going over everything in grating detail, and regularly cuts to irrelevant characters such as Ikalgo and Welfin. The series has a highly subverted anticlimax after hours upon hours of great build up, so shocking that I stopped watching the series before the final epilogue episodes in disgust.",3

                1. This review is very long. Though, there is a ""tl;dr"" at the very end for all my main conclusions
2. I do not take animation or soundtrack into count when scoring an anime; I only weigh the story. 
There comes a point in your life where you think your expectations have been met. You begin to see as an avid anime fan that if it is Shonen, ESPECIALLY if it runs in Shonen Jump, then it has been done before and will probably be done again. But this time… I’m not sure I can say that anymore. There possibly never has been a journey so
                  fulfilling, so empowering and profound as the journey of Hunter x Hunter. This was not an adventure for the characters. This was an adventure for the viewers.
---PLOT---
Hunter x Hunter is something I didn’t expect to like at all. As you can see, it appears to be a very generic, run of the mill, action shonen. But to my surprise, it successfully deconstructs that exact genre. It’s a once in a lifetime experience to see such an iconic demographic be torn to shreds and reassembled in a near perfect way.
You can read the basic premise on MAL, so I won’t explain it here. What I will explain is why you shouldn’t let the seemingly generic, or even ""childish"" nature of it stop you from experiencing this thrill ride of an anime, which has the ability to trigger almost every human emotion possible. It takes the most unoriginal plot; a boy searching for his father, and turns it into something much, much more. There’s practically nothing you can’t find in this show. Its deep, it’s entertaining, and above all, it can emotionally effect its audience better than most things these days, all while maintaining its shonen tag. 
Hunter x Hunter is comprised of seven individual story arcs, and every one of them flows into the next one so naturally you barely notice the change, yet they’re all still so diverse in theme and intention to where you could never confuse one arc for another. Like the title picture would suggest, they fit together like a puzzle, while still seeming to all be different genres. Despite this, the single most defining genre of Hunter x Hunter is adventure. After all, it is a journey about friendship, and it does run in Shonen Jump, the magazine where Naruto, Bleach, and Dragon Ball were and are published. Yet, it is so much more mature in every sense of the word than those three.
It is shonen done right, and nothing short of it. It will even bend the rules of a typical Jump title and cover extremely depressing and dark topics from time to time, (ranging from human compassion to torture) and it never fails to influence when it does. (I remember portions of the manga “Bakuman” where the editors would constantly remind the artists that work under them, “This isn’t suitable for Jump,” for violence and such other gritty aspects. It just made me think of how Hunter x Hunter runs in Jump, yet is incredibly gory at times.)
And then that brings us to what a shonen implies; Battles.
Oh.
Boy.
The entire idea behind the battles is that the characters have to use a lot of observation and strategic thinking to win them. The outcome is never that easily observed; keeping an unpredictable flow of originality in this world. The magic behind the fights is done with an ability called Nen, where the user can manipulate the life energy (aura) surrounding themselves and use it for basically any purpose whatsoever. The system that explains the ups and down of Nen is so well thought out and creative that it allows there to be very, very many different ways one can fight, and Nen doesn’t even have to be used for combat. 
The anime devotes a lot of its time to actually training its characters to become stronger, and it doesn’t play around. You have to be tough to survive in Hunter x Hunter's world; if you aren’t, you will most likely be picked off very quickly. (Its ridiculous how this anime treats its side characters sometimes)
But this is just the beginning. In order for one to learn Nen, they must be a Hunter. The primary goal, the focal point of the anime, is to become, (and better yourself as) a Hunter. A Hunter applicant must pass a rigorous examination where they’re strength, endurance, experience and wisdom are all tested. If they are to pass, (and less than one in a hundred thousand do) they will become an elite member of humanity, given the right to search for magical beasts, hidden treasures, and even other people. Being a Hunter is one of the most simple, yet original premises of rank and privilege there is. You can be a literal Hunter for anything, the sky is the limit. So given that all these amazing premises are the trademark of Hunter x Hunter, it should be a given that the anime is brilliant.
That being said, however, it does indeed go through a bit of a rough patch; the beginning doesn’t really encompass the whole feel of the anime, because it delves into very depressing and dark themes rather... quickly. Not only that, but the actual quality of the arcs aren't completely level. Some arcs meander too much and end up becoming lengthy. That's not to say they don't fulfill their purpose; in fact, the one arc guilty of this actually has one of the deepest side stories in Hunter x Hunter. It's just drug out.
---Plot Score: -Amazing- ---
---CHARACTERS---
If there was one thing that is nearly impossible to get right in all of fiction, particularly a weekly boy’s magazine, it is the characters. But fear not; this is not the case. I can’t recall a time where I’ve seen characterization and character development done well in such a long span of time, and this is actually to date the longest anime I’ve ever seen. But that’s a good thing, because I don’t think it can be topped.
The main character, Gon Freecss, is a kindhearted young boy who grew up surrounded by nature. He can easily befriend all forms of life and is infinitely curious. He isn’t interested in judging anybody. He just wants to find his father, a world renowned Hunter. But underneath his playful exterior is a soul that will never give up: even if his life will surely end because of his actions. He will do whatever it takes, literally to the point of sacrificing his mortal body and driving himself to the point of insanity, to avenge or save a friend.His partner in crime, Killua Zoldyck, is a once lethal assassin who grew up in a very abusive home. Being constantly exposed to electric shocks and other various pain inducing devices, he decides it would be for the better of him to give up killing others, and instead become a good person with his friend Gon. Killua’s character development, where we see him go from a hotheaded killer to a loving brother and self-sacrificial friend, was so amazingly written it leaves me speechless. He is my favorite character and for very good reason. 
Kurapika, the third primary protagonist, is a quiet person who has an over the top hatred for the people responsible for killing his entire tribe. He belongs to the Kurta Clan, a group of people whose eyes glow bright red when angered or upset. Since their eyes stay that way after death, they are valued as one of the most beautiful things in the world and sought after in high regard. He becomes very emotional very quickly and lets anger and resentment cloud his judgment, but will still place the well-beings of his friends above his own goals. Leorio, the fourth and final primary protagonist is a seemingly greedy and unlikable man who only cares about money. This is revealed not to be the case, as his ultimate goal is to become a doctor and treat patients free of charge. After losing one of those closest to him simply because he could not afford to treat them, he cannot let that happen to anyone ever again, and will also do whatever it takes to protect his comrades.
With how they're used, unlike in a lot of action centered Shonen, the main characters are mostly along for the ride instead of being completely tied to the outcome of the problem they face. They're not key players, and while they influence the narrative to an extent, the entire outcome doesn't rely on them. This is such a unique plot mechanic for a story like this, and its originality is heightened by the relationships and character interactions that happen.
We see the characters get deconstructed emotionally as their beliefs are picked at and tested, therefore expressing the diversity and development in the cast, which is done incredibly well with not only the main characters, but also the villains. The goodness in everyone can and will sprout from even the darkest of hearts. This anime produced more favorite characters of mine than any other, and it is a shame that there isn’t more room on the character favorites list for them all. I just wish that some of these characters got a little more screen time.
---Characters Score: -Amazing- ---
---ANIMATION---
Madhouse at their best. There isn’t a better way to put it. Fights are amazingly choreographed and always extremely fluid and consistent. They must have had to devote a lot of their resources to keeping the same quality of animation throughout 148 episodes, and they sure do deliver. My only gripe would be the censorship. If one were to read the manga, one would know just how violent it can get. I wish the violence wasn’t as hidden in the anime as it is but that is just a nitpick. With this aside, there really is no more to say about the animation. It never wavers; it stays crisp and clean the whole time. What could possibly go wrong?
---Animation Score: -Amazing- ---
---SOUNDTRACK---
This can, unfortunately. I cannot let the problems escape from under my nose. The soundtrack isn’t very great. In the first arc, the anime is highly belittled by transitions that make it seem like something intended for the younger audiences of Pokemon and other children’s anime. The music is generic at best, and the only real ascent in soundtrack quality is during the sixth arc, where the disturbing themes are underlined by dramatic and suspenseful music. And just as a little note, if a character plays a piece of music with an instrument within the anime, don’t use it as a background piece that you will play repeatedly; it makes the scene sound tacky.
Though, that is just speaking for the music that plays during the runtime. The opening and ending themes are completely different stories. When you first hear the opening, it sounds HIGHLY forgettable and not at all catchy, though it doesn’t take long for it to become a very iconic tune to any blossoming fan. That goes for the endings too, which are all very good in their own way, and all sound completely different too.
---Soundtrack Score: -Substantial- ---
AFTER REPORT:
PROS:
-	Successfully deconstructs shonen clichés
-	Original use of characters in shonen; they’re more along for the ride
-	Exciting character interactions and very well written development
-	Battles are awesome to watch
-	Seven very unique arcs with a vast quantity of interesting themes and ideas
-	Eye candy animation
MIXED:
-	ITS LONGGGGGG
-	Violence is censored
CONS:
-	Other “main” characters are forgotten quite often
-	Flat soundtrack
OVERALL: -Brilliant-
When I first caught wind of Hunter x Hunter, I heard nothing but praise. It is number three on MAL, and I couldn’t fathom how on earth it was that high, hiding among the greats like Fullmetal and Steins;Gate.
I was taking a huge risk when I started something so long, but that risk definitely paid off. This will remain to be one of my favorites, and I can only hope the mangaka gets his ass in gear so that we can get a cour two.

                [Part 1: Introduction]
As the dwindling wine swashes to and fro in my glass, I struggle to find a uniting thread atop which Hunter X Hunter's myriad arcs can be described. The series is a jovial but deeply confused hodgepodge of conflicting themes and narratives, some so starkly different from the last that they'd be better suited for an entirely different series rather than a single continuity. 
This may be less noticeable when watching week-to-week as originally intended, but when binged, Hunter x Hunter is not unlike a train wreck - except instead of being over in a flash, the viewer must watch in horror as
                  each train-car crashes into the next in agonizing slow motion, eventually coalescing into an infernal scrapheap from which the original shape of the story can no longer be divined. Just when you think the blaze is past its zenith, another train-car comes careening into the fray, exploding the shattered remains of the story all over again. 
To accurately summarize Hunter x Hunter as a complete work, we'll need to backtrack all the way to the beginning and appreciate the series for what it was before it meteorically spun off the rails and hurled itself towards an excruciating demise. It won't take long since Hunter x Hunter was only good for a short time.
[Part 2: When Hunter x Hunter Was Good]
Hunter x Hunter, as any narratively-educated person would tell you, was best before it introduced the bullshit anything-goes superpower known as neen. Simple in form but satisfying in execution, the series originally focused on boy-genius Gone Freecss striving to follow in his mysterious dad's footsteps by acquiring a hunting license; a privilege also coveted by the initially strong supporting characters, Kurapika and Killua. Using only their natural aptitudes and signature tools (fishing rod, glowing eyes, and skateboard, respectively), Gone and co. set out on a varied adventure full of interesting challenges and encounters. 
What any seasoned anime viewer will immediately appreciate is the relatively grounded action and progression. Without getting overly specific, Hunter x Hunter diligently ensures that each enemy and obstacle is overcome diegetically, utilizing the environment, the tools available, and the characters' inherent wits. From Gone outplaying Hisoka with his trusty fishing rod, to Killua utilizing his past as a skateboarding mercenary, everything in the first arcs of Hunter x Hunter feels earned. Abilities and talents remain strictly within the universe's realm of probability, and the power-scale develops organically as our characters progress through the Hunter Exam by the skin of their teeth. THIS is how you write Shōnen. 
Watching the tension developing between Hisoka and our main cast was an absolute joy, and experiencing the theatrics between the Hunter Exam and the Heaven Tournament arcs left me consistently surprised and delighted. All of this eventually culminates in a beautifully animated fight between Gone and Hisoka, which I wholeheartedly recommend as the 'true' conclusion to the series, because it all falls apart shortly after.
[Part 3: When Hunter x Hunter Went Off the Rails and Exploded]
Everything you just read gets thrown out the window when neen is haphazardly conceived and shoved into the story out of nowhere. With no previous indication of its nature or existence, this half-baked power infects the characters at every turn and transitions the story from a sensibly-scaled adventure into an unholy whirlpool of tropes 'borrowed' from other series (especially Alien). Over the show's infuriatingly prolonged run-time, our characters will slog through battle after battle with other neen-users, most of which utilize wholly silly and unsatisfying abilities. 
(Kurapika is the biggest offender here, utilizing immensely powerful magic to summon, wait for it... chains. CHAINS. Tell me with a straight face that somebody who uses reality-bending magic to summon run-of-the-mill chains is cool. You can't, because they aren't.)
What follows is simultaneously everything and nothing, because each subsequent arc is little more than a contrived set-piece without any real purpose or thoughtfulness. One arc will feature our characters entering a video game (not a joke), the next will have them fighting a xenomorph/Cell knockoff in a fictionalized rendition of Australia, and so on. Each previous arc is immediately forgotten upon the introduction of the next, and with that forgetfulness often comes abandoned characters and unresolved plot threads. One of the worst examples of wasted potential in serialized history. 
I would elaborate on the voice acting or soundtrack, but there's really nothing of note in that department except for Hisoka's performance. 
I can strongly recommend the first three or so arcs to anyone. I can only recommend the others to someone who is hospitalized and has nothing else to do (but only if you're not in critical condition because this trash could kill you.)",4
"
                I can’t believe it’s not an adventure shonen with fillers!
If you like FMA, Naruto, Bleach, Attack on Titan or Death Note, stop reading and go watch it now until episode 3 at least. This show is one of those classics that inexplicably managed to go relatively unnoticed by anime fans, although this remake gave it some deserved recognition. Be warned, though I mention other series along the way I'm not hating on them, I like them but I'm just comparing them to this series.
OVERALL 10/10
This remake is another gem by Madhouse. I also recommend the first anime by Nippon Animation, but the remake covers a
                  lot more of the manga that started in 1998. This is an incredible series and, contrary to what you might think given its episode count, DOES NOT HAVE FILLER ARCS. There are two recap episodes and that’s it. The show is faithful to the manga 99% of the time and there are only two instances that I found upsetting about this adaptation, though they don’t hurt the series overall and you wouldn’t notice them unless you read the manga or watched the NA version. 
This series is about hunters: professionals that travel around the world on different, generally dangerous missions.  They often specialize in a specific field, so you have archeological hunters, who find and restore ruins; gourmet hunters, who find exotic ingredients (probably the inspiration for Toriko XD); blacklist hunters, who find and catch criminals, and so on. The flipside is that there are numerous benefits to being a hunter, but it is really difficult to become one.
STORY AND SETTING 10/10
This series is ideal for marathoning, because almost every episode moves the story forward in a significant way. The story is very good, but given it is from the 90s, it starts a bit slow and generic so it may turn off impatient people. Bear with me, after the third episode the plot takes off. Every arc is totally unique but somehow connects with the rest, and there's a lot variety to choose from: an arc with chuunin-like exams and survival games, a (short) training and fighting arc, a complex thriller involving maffia and terrorism (my personal favorite), SAO done well, and one that I will not mention because it's probably the best and I won't spoil it. The plot twists are almost never predictable: the author is expert in trolling the viewer in a pleasant way. If you are tired of watching battle shonens in which every arc ends with a fight between the protagonist and the arc villain, this series is for you. The author is never afraid of subverting tropes. In some arcs the protagonist plays second fiddle or even is put on a bus, but that’s because there are actually four main characters and the story is set in alternate world similar to ours in which not everything is solved with punches. Therefore, the focus is always more on adventure; battles always take a second or third place. That doesn’t mean the battles are lame, though, there aren’t many, but they are always good because there is a great focus on strategy and psychology. As you might expect from other series of this genre, there are superpowers involved, but the author developed a pretty detailed and consistent system that makes sure there are no asspulls like in other shows, and DEATHS ARE FINAL. The nen abilities (the superpowers akin to chakra, cosmos or ki) are very imaginative and interesting, and not always created for fighting. I recommend to watch at least until episode 37, in which one of the best arcs in anime history starts. While the manga hasn't finished (actually it's on hiatus as of this writing), the anime ends at a point that feels like a very good conclusion but still leaves the door open for continuation. This is when you will hate the author, Yoshihiro Togashi, because he is prone to hiatus and the last one is one year long and counting. And yes, the current manga arc is very promising :C There are two non-canon movies as well: they are entertaining but for the most part an excuse for flashy battles that do not follow the rules of nen.
CHARACTERS 10/10
This series has some of the best characters I have ever seen. Gon, the protagonist, is initially an homage to child Goku, your standard idiot hero with pure heart and simple mind, except that he wants to become a hunter to find his father, who abandoned him to become a hunter. A bit generic, but as the series goes on, he starts developing and meets and befriends other hunter candidates that are increasingly complex and interesting. One particular example is Kurapika, the most obvious inspiration for Sasuke but less emo and more balanced. Special mention goes to Killua, Gon's best friend and a polar opposite to him in almost every way (no wonder he's a fan favorite). Oh, and he's also a former assassin, cute. As you might guess, what’s interesting about this series is that morality sometimes gets thrown out of the window just like in FMA: whether the protagonists or the villains are right sometimes depends on you. In fact, some villains are so charismatic, mysterious and complex that they steal the show every time they appear, even in short appearances. This is particularly true for the Spiders (the likeliest inspiration for Akatsuki but done right), Hisoka, and Meruem. There are no romantic subplots, but one arc (widely considered the best one) contains one of the best love stories I've ever seen in anime, I was moved to tears.
SOUND 9/10
The sound effects are very good. The music is just awesome, as expected of the same composer that worked on Death Note (expect some familiar motifs). Mozart’s Lacrimosa is played in one especially epic scene, and if you don’t get goosebumps from it you’re probably not human. The only problem is that a few tracks are misused and break the mood of some scenes and the SAME OPENING SONG is used in all 148 episodes, albeit with a few remixed versions (yes, it's annoying enough to not give Sound a 10). The are many endings songs which kinda make up for it. The all-star cast of voice actors do a great job. Many voices will ring a bell: KENN, Ayumi Fujimura, Miyuki Sawashiro, Kouki Uchiyama, Hiroki Takahashi, Daisuke Namikawa, Aya Hirano, Fumihiko friggin' Gendo Tachiki, ROMI PARK, MAMORU MIYANO, BANJOU GINGA!! you get the point, the list goes on and on. With Kana Hanazawa and Hiroshi Kamiya the list would've been perfect :C
ART AND ANIMATION 9/10
The art is pretty good, although the mood and style is a bit more colorful and happy than the dark style of the NA version, which nailed it in my opinion. The art style and effects improve upon the manga but manage to stay faithful, and the animation is pretty good for a long-running series. I don’t remember instances of cringe-worthy “quality animation” that made Shippuuden and other series so infamous. However, some episodes feel a bit uninspired in their use of angles and animation, probably to save budget for more action-packed episodes. There are a lot of gory scenes in the manga that were cleverly toned down (no lazy black fog censoring), since this was aired on a Sunday morning timeslot.
ENJOYMENT: 10/10
Totally recommended, and a mandatory watch for battle-adventure shonen fans.
The NA version became my favorite anime of all time, but I can't deny the awesomeness of this remake. Even after witnessing other hits such as Attack on Titan, Evangelion, FMA or Death Note, this series remains my favorite.",10

                [Spoiler Free Review]
I typically am not someone who hands out 10's when reviewing much of anything, especially for a seemingly typical shonen, but this is an exception. I would only consider giving something a 10 if I felt left thinking there was nothing I would change, and that's exactly what HxH did.
The story does starts off a bit more like a typical shonen... but by god does the rest of the series make up for it...  It's honestly everything I've ever wanted from an anime and more... 
Never have I been:
• so attached to an anime.
• so satisfied by the fight scenes level of
                  detail in strategy.
• so complimentary of the power systems level of balance and unique ideas such as vows and limitations and clear rules that are followed through the whole anime.
• so emotionally attached to characters relationships.
• so amazed by how much forethought, subtle foreshadowing, and extremely complex the plot was.
• so in love with a soundtracks and artwork (especially in the CA arc).
• so though provoked about controversial mindsets of characters, where even though they are antagonists to the main characters, I still understand their perspective and even like them, sometimes more than the main characters. Not just your typical 'evil' guy who is inherently bad, but just a different frame of mind that has real, good reasons for why they are doing what they do.
• so satisfied with one episode in particular that in my mind changed how I viewed anime altogether. It was so immensely satisfying and the build up to get there was so incredibly meticulous, yet entirely unpredictable. 
Honestly, I've been watching anime since I was a little boy.... I'm 25 now and I feel more attached to this anime then I have been to any other anime. Period. That's something that I thought I wouldn't get out of an anime anymore now that I'm older... But HxH really did change that for me...
Perhaps it's not a show for everyone... but it's perfect for me... I loved everything about it... The art, sound, characters, story, everything! This is a masterpiece by Togashi and it's a shame that it doesn't get the recognition it deserves.
Edit: I'm 29 now and I've rewatched the show several times and everything I said previously still holds true.",10

                I am saying hi to everyone that sees my review! Now we are talking about Hunter X Hunter, this series that is very loved right now. This is my favorite anime, and the plot and characters are just amazing! First I am not gonna lie, I didn't thought it will be very interesting, a story of Gon Freecs that is trying to become a hunter, but while watching it I liked Gon a lot more than I expected. Gon met Killua, Kurapika and Leorio during the hunter exams, 3 people that are very different in comparation, but all of them are very enjoyable. They later
                  become friends and the journey starts!
The story starts good, it looks like a childish anime at the very first episodes but then it gets more and more darker, the plot evolves. The story development gets better and better and every arc is great.  
Art is 10/10 for me, for a 2011 anime it looks really good, clean and there are no bad animation moments. The characters look good, pretty realistic in my opinion (ex: Leorio, Kurapika). The details are very good, you can easily see them in characters eyes for example, like Gon, Killua, Kurapika and many more.
The character development for the Hunter x Hunter characters is something that you don't see so much in other animes. The way of think, their actions are well made. The antagonists, like Chrollo Lucifer represent the devil, along with Kurapika. Chimera Ant Arc is the arc where the characters got the best character development (compared to the rest of arcs) and it's full of religious symbolism, dynamics and many more.
The Main 4 is maybe the best anime squad, and I wish we will be able to see them more in the future! My favorite in the main 4 is Killua. Killua is an ex-assasin, he is cool and has a lot of different personality moments. He is sometimes very funny, his cat faces are so random and funny I swear! When Killua gets into a fight, he is serious, and very badass and I like how he almost always win. I like the fact that he changes his outfit in almost every episode compared to other anime characters. Gon Freecs is a basic main character, but he is a good one. He is very funny but he is also a really good friend that supports anytime his friends and people that need help. Even if Leorio didn't have a lot of screen time, he still was one of the best characters in the show. He is funny and just like Gon he cares about his friends and always tries his best to help them. Now the last one is Kurapika, a guy that had one of the most sad backstory. His clan got killed by the Phantom Troupe, and he does his best trying to kill every Phantom Troupe members and to get the eyes of his clan members back.
Sound is 9/10. The soundtracks are very well made but sometimes they are used to much or not in the best moments. Also the anime doesn't change the opening, this is also another point why I rated the sound 9/10.
Thank you, Togashi for this masterpiece, I hope that you will finish it, it has potential to be the greatest story ever, so I am looking forward to see what is going to happen.
I don't know how helpful my review is but just give a try to Hunter X Hunter and I hope you'll enjoy!",10
"
                I'm not a fan of long reviews so I'm going to keep this short and to the point.
Actual waste of time. 
Never have I ended up watching a show so boring for more than 2 episodes. After 12 episodes of hxh, it was still extremely boring and unentertaining. Everyone keeps saying ""oh it gets better after the first arc"" so I ask how many episodes it is, and they usually say around 30, which is more than a season of any seasonal anime, which are more fun to watch than this. 
The art ? I cant call anything in hxh art, there was none, it
                  was all just lines with some colour, it was extremely basic and boring. Non of the characters were appealing in anyway. 
The story was just a generic shounen kid looking for his lost dad and gets attacked by a pedo clown which is horny over Gon. 
The characters were so boring they made me fall asleep, even the fights were boring, nothing was fun to watch. Every character was poorly made and had terrible personalities. 
I will never be able to understand how this is an enjoyable show to watch.",1
"
                Time to review one of the best anime ever. First off, I have to say, I liked the old HxH so much. It was a great show in many aspects. However, I think it is safe to say the 2011 version has surpassed the previous one by all means. This anime is one hell of a rollercoaster that you just can't stop watching. You will start, click next episode over and over and over again without a break. This show is just pure amazingness that anyone and everyone can enjoy. This reboot of the show is phenomenal In every sense and is a must watch
                  masterpiece for all anime fans. 
Character - 10/10
I want to start with the characters in this review because I truly think that the characters are some off the best in any anime. The protagonist of Hunter x Hunter 2011 is a 12 year old boy named Gon Freecs. His goal in the show is to find his dad, Ging Freecs. Now on the outside, Gon might seem like the generic shounen protagonist who always fights to save his friends, but soon into the story, we find out there is much more than that to Gon. His true nature is still arcane to us and his role in the story is superb. Next up is Killua Zoldyck, also 12 years old. Killua is part of a large family of assassins and has never really had any freedom up until he meets Gon. Killua's first friend is Gon and he wants, no matter what, to travel the world with Gon in search of Gon's dad and protect him. While Killua wants to help Gon, it is really Gon who is helping Killua and endure his family problems and he is a great character to watch grow. Leorio is the third main character at the age of 19. He is such an interesting character and its a shame he is so sidelined. Leorio had lost a friend to a treatable disease and took the hunter exam to get enough money to go to medical school. He is probably the funniest character in the show and its truly sad we don't get more of him. Last of the main characters is Kurapika. Kurapika is part of a clan called the kurta, who are famous for scarlet eyes. His clan was annihilated in order to get the kurta eyes by a group called the phantom troupe. Kurapika's goal is to seek revenge on the group that killed his clan. Watching Kurapika grow as a character and seek revenge was excellent and he remains one of my favorite characters in the series. Last, but definitely not least, are the supporting characters of Hunter x Hunter. There is so much I could say about these characters. The list goes on and on with great characters like Hisoka, Neferpitou, Meruem, etc. The list is ongoing and each supporting character/villian has such amazing growth and development in the show that you end up being amazed with all that they do. The characters in Hunter x Hunter are truly outstanding.
Story - 10/10
The story, as I said before is about Gon trying to find his dad, Ging Freecs, who is a hunter as well and Gon has never met him before. He goes through many hardships and trials to seek out his dad who is shrouded in mystery. The story starts out with the four main characters taking the hunter exam to become hunters for their own goals and dreams. Killua trying to break his families spell, Kurapika trying to avenge his clan by killing off the phantom troupe, and lastly Leorio becoming a superb doctor. After the hunter exam, the story really takes a turn for the better. Each arc that comes to pass is about our characters goals and dreams and each arc up until now improve and improve. The current arc of the Chimera Ant Arc is definitely the best one yet. Each character has to go through their own hardships and improve themselves enough to become good enough to achieve the goals they are striving for.
Art - 9/10
The art in the show is by far superior to that of the original's. The art makes the battles and scenes all around intense and is pretty great on yours eyes to look at. I honestly have no real complaints for this.
Sound - 10/10
As I write this review, I am currently listening to osts from this anime. The ost list is wonderful. Each arc has a variety of osts they really stand out and fit each scene so perfectly, specifically OST 3, which contains osts mainly for the chimera ant arc. Hunter x Hunter does something a little different with the openings. Rather than change it completely every so often like most shounen anime, HxH using the same opening (departure) and changes the version of it every so often. Its quite a decent opening so this difference works here. The endings are also very enjoyable to listen to. The voice actors are really decent and do their characters voice so well; Gon's especially.
Enjoyment - 10/10
I had so much enjoyment watching this. From start to finish I just couldn't stop watching the show. I ended up marathoning the whole show (110 episodes at the time) in just a week. This is a very outstanding show to enjoy.
Overall - 10/10
This show is a masterpiece. From story to characters to art to sound, everything in this show is perfect. I cannot fathom a person disliking this show at all. It's just that good. All in all this series just keeps you on the edge of your seats and I hope that this brings in more people to enjoy the masterpiece I have enjoyed so much.",10
"
                I've been putting off watching Hunter x Hunter for the longest time ever. Since I picked it up, the only thing I've regret is, not picking it up sooner. 
If you're looking for an anime that gives you both heart-warming AND heart-wrenching feelings, you have come to the right place because no other anime has sent me on an emotional trainwreck like Hunter x Hunter. 
Story: 10/10 
As a long-time shounen fan, what bothers me the most about a majority of shounen series is the story; the lack of flow between arcs and the inconsistency. Hunter x Hunter is none of that, it is thoroughly
                  consistent in the pacing (except for Chimera Ant Arc) throughout majority of the series. 
Furthermore, Hunter x Hunter gives reason behind the reasons WHY our protagonists go to certain places for the next arc - the fact that this is striving towards their goals (for Gon - to find his dad). Every single battle, every single interaction - this all strives for a bigger meaning in the arc and the bigger picture. 
Art: 10/10 
Madhouse did an amazing job at animating this 2011 Hunter x Hunter anime as when I looked back into the arcs on manga, Togashi's drop in quality is incredibly noticeable yet we don't see it at all in the anime. Everything is consistently beautiful in Hunter x Hunter. 
Sound: 9/10 
The voice actors did an amazing job in portraying the characters' emotions. I'm thoroughly impressed by the cast and how they performed their roles in Hunter x Hunter. The background music is usually tasteful and suiting to the scenario, I have no complaints there. 
The only thing that I didn't like was the opening (as a lot of people mention likewise) - it's repetitive for 148 episodes, and personally, it's not my cup of tea. They could've picked a better opening but I've settled to skipping to 1:30 in most episodes. 
Character: 10/10 
Story and Character in Hunter x Hunter go hand-in-hand. As with the driving of the plot, we see a LOT of character development in A LOT of characters. 
Part of the reason why I think it is amazing though is the fact that characters actually die after they receive character development - incredibly realistic considering the circumstances of the story. 
The only complaint I have towards the characters would be in Leorio - I haven't read the manga so I'm not sure how Togashi continues Hunter x Hunter, but Leorio hasn't received as much attention as the others as the anime is (considering he is one of our protagonists). However, the antagonists especially - is one of the best in ANY anime series. 
Hisoka, Illumi, Meruem, and Kuroro are one-of-a-kind, you will find yourselves in love with these characters EVEN if you don't agree with half of the things they do. I found myself contemplating what I would do if I were in their shoes for a major part of the series, and found it incredibly heart-breaking. 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
I've never had an anime where I cried, laughed, felt grossed out, wanted to chuck a fit and feel sorry for the characters SO MUCH, as I did with Hunter x Hunter. 
At the end of Chimera Ant Arc, I bawled my eyes out - during the 13th Chairman Election Arc, I laughed so hard. 
And best of all, Killua and Gon's relationship is probably one of the most heart-warming and heart-wrenching friendships you will ever come across in ANY anime. 
Overall: 10/10
You won't regret watching Hunter x Hunter, it is worth it and honestly, it is now my favourite anime in my books after watching it - even after watching anime consistently for 9 years.",10

                (6.0/10) 
Hunter X Hunter is a flawed show that's trying incredibly hard to break through the endless loop of sameness that plagues its genre. 
Shounen-action anime has always been something that's light. Its also something that's made to last. From shows like Bleach to One Piece to FMA to Hunter X Hunter, these shows almost never stop before the sixty episode mark. 
This is mainly due to their incessant need to stay on air. Its very blatant that a lot of these shows have a very prolonged production schedule that seems to string the entire show along. This means that these shows are almost flawed
                  by nature. When you have an endless stream of consciousness, you tend to babble. 
I know this first-hand, too. I tend to talk way too much about a topic I know i can be concise about. I just kind of repeat the same shit in a slightly different way and only after i'm done repeating it do I realize that i've repeated myself. Its an awkward flaw to have, especially since I love talking about things i'm passionate about, positively or negatively. So i tend to talk way too mucha bout a topic i know I can be concise about. I just kind of repeat the same shit in a somewhat different way... Well, you see what I mean. 
...
I'm a fan of things that try to be out there. I love shows that make that creative leap into the realm of the unknown... so it should come as no surprise that i'm simply not a fan of Shounen-action shows. They're always so drawn out. They always beat a dead horse until its nothing but mashed meat. They always pretend not to have filler by injecting plot into otherwise filler episodes, and that in itself is annoying. Lastly, they almost always have shit animation. 
Even shows like FMA:Brotherhood ended up feeling dragged out to me. I ended up being very disenchanted with a story that just goes too far. The stakes became too high, the entire scenario ended up being really dumb and over-the-top in the worst way possible. That defines Shounen for me. 
...
I don't think you'll be surprised to hear that I think HunterXHunter is massively overrated. I think that just about every aspect of it isn't as good as I see people claim it is. However, I do think that it does its best to separate itself from the onslaught of shit-Shounen out there. If anything, its the most entertaining one I've seen. 
Much like the show, i'll be splitting my review into six parts, with a short conclusion to wrap things up. So, without further wait, lets get into it. 
________________________________________
[PART 1] : The Shounen Exams 
When comparing this show to other shounen-action anime I try to think back to every single episode. This is naturally hard since there are a whopping 148 episodes. But nevertheless, I try. 
Much like a lot of Shounen, HunterXHunter plays like a stream of conscious. The breathing breaks are the light hearted episodes and the story-driven episodes are the rambling. Which, for the most part, is fairly cohesive. 
Occasionally the story gets a bit too muddled with its own rules, as the creator of the manga seems to have a hard-on for them. The amount of information overload through undramatic exposition is pretty incredible in this show. 
I felt like every other scene is just a certain character explaining a new rule or a new way to implement a previously established rule. If you think you'll get away with learning the rules from the beginning of the show, I have bad news. Literally every arc has a brand new set of rules.
From an MMO-esq card game to learning how to use your inner force, everything has names and abilities and ways to establish them. I feel like all of them are impressively crafted but in the end it feels as though it's something to study rather than to watch. 
They are almost never delivered in an engaging way and these exposition scenes quickly lose you as a viewer.
...
That's the sad thing about most Shounen. A lot of them make their way to the action, but the actual way they end up going is animation-saving dialogue scenes that do little to establish characters. And when they DO establish characters its almost always through wrestler-esq jobbing or blatant exposition. 
And that's just part one of these Shounen exams. Since Hunter X Hunter seems to eager to check every single marker off the ""Shounen Cliches list"". But that doesn't mean it doesn't do them well, for the most part. 
These exposition scenes are almost always backed by engaging, if not overused, scores. As well as at least some character banter that makes it seem like you aren't being lectured in a college classroom. 
This goes for fights as well. Each one is about strategy, and while that may be engaging for some, I found myself horribly disinterested in a lot of them. Thankfully most fights don't last for more than an episode, but when the fight is dragged out, I found myself zoning out. 
The issue the writer has to juggle with is the idea of maintaining tension while still dragging the show through the exposition puddle every half a second. Even in the shows more memorable fight scenes, its Shounen roots show and I find myself relaxed instead of gripping the edges of my seat. 
I think its more of a personal taste...But if there was a Shounen-cliche exam, this show would pass with flying colors. Here's your Shounen-card, HxH, use it well. 
_______________________________________
[PART 2] : The Shounen Family 
Now that the show is settled comfortably in its Shounen roots, lets talk about how it tries to break free. In the middle of this shows teen-boy demographic I constantly see a show that's just one or two steps away from becoming fully engaging. 
Through the shows six arcs, it developed solidly. Starting as a mostly innocent fun romp, its slow decent into darker storytelling was something that intrigued me. However, I never felt like they went ""whole hog"" with it. Apart from very specific scenes every so often, I hardly ever felt surprised with this show.
This is mainly due to it inheriting a lot of negative traits from its Shounen parents. Those traits being Deus Ex Machina, and as I've said before, a mass amount of exposited information... constantly. 
The show itself has two goals, develop the relationship between Gon and Killua, the shows protagonists, and make its merry way to the next battle. While the relationship between Gon and Killua never feels forced, I always felt like it was one step away from becoming something special. 
For every entertaining piece of character building we got an extremely cheese-filled edgy sequence. Or one of those horrendous panning shots of the characters face as he says something edgy. Its cheese, and its not funny cheese. its the kind of cheese that's kind of moldy that smells bad, not the kind you want to sprinkle over your beef stroganoff. 
That being said, their relationship does end up playing as the crux of the show, even if the show does do the smart decision of not making them major players in a lot of these arcs. Apart from one arc in the show, Gon and Killua always felt like helpers, rather than leaders. This was a conscious decision by the creator to make the universe feel constantly more dangerous as their eyes open to new possibilities with their power.
Apart from one scene in particular, the show stays true to that and I appreciated this greatly. It had a certain honesty to it. 
__________________________________
[Part 3] : Shounen Arena 
So lets talk about how this show stacks up when compared to its partners like FMA. Well, personally, i enjoyed it a decent amount more than FMA. For one, the tone of HxH felt more engaging. 
While FMA usually kept its tone serious apart from the very obvious ""joke"" scenes, where the failed attempt of humor became overbearing. HxH does the smart thing and makes the humor feel slightly (and I mean very slightly) more natural. A lot of the jokes aren't really drawn at the characters expense. 
With that, the shows entire tonal shift towards the latter half, with it becoming more violent and heartbreaking, works fairly well. Its always interesting to see something so happy go so wrong. 
I had a very ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" vibe with the shows first two arcs. This is great news, since Avatar is one of my favorite shows of all time. The light hearted nature combined with the less-lighthearted thematic elements made for a nice little juxtaposition. 
While I won't compare it to the likes of Attack on Titan, since that show is hardly finished, I'll say that HxH does Shounen in what is most likely the most engaging possible way. It stays true to the cliches whilst enhancing the parts it can make better. 
For example, its willingness to have these characters get separated, or stay off-screen, is a change that I enjoyed. The cast in this show is gargantuan but they never feel forced. This leads me to the best part of the show. 
________________________________
[PART 4] : An Auction for Design 
This shows best quality is its character design. While the animation itself is fairly lacking due to the constant use of re-used footage as well as still-images to fill time and save budget, the character designs shine. 
I can't think of a single character in this show that wasn't memorable to some extent. Even the smaller characters that ended up being killed soon after their introduction had so much creativity put behind them, you couldn't guess that they wouldn't be major players. 
In fact, the most entertaining aspect of the show was the unexpected change that certain characters were introduced only to die... and you realizing that, that amazing character design had you completely fooled!
Every character also has a place in the shows extensive rule-book of power. Each character does feel like a player. That's great. 
Whether its the creepy, yet bad-ass joker-esq clown, Hisoka, or Killua's entire family, these players are constantly something to look out for. This show does a marvelous job with making these unique characters stand out and I never found myself forgetting who someone was. That's a great feat for show that has seemingly hundreds of characters! 
___________________________________
[PART 5] : Greedy Episodes
Every arc feels like it has progression. This keeps building and building until the shows final arc. I'm not counting the very final twelve episodes as a whole arc since I felt as though they were there to create a conclusion rather than a continuation, even if the manga isn't done. 
Before I get into the final arc, I want to discuss a shounen anime's ability to drag. Whether its something like Dragonball Z or even a much shorter show like Attack on Titan. Shounen has this genre cliche of dragging out stories to fit time slots.
Hunter X Hunter felt as though it was breaking that mold by making every arc feel as though its breezy and fast. Even the Greed Island arc, which had an entirely new video game rule-set in place felt quicker than I expected. It played with its sillier roots well and the conclusion of the arc, while a bit obvious, served as a nice segway into the next one. 
This was the case for most of the shows arcs, too. Each one was backed by catchy toons, especially the Yorknew Auction arc which has my favorite ending theme to any anime i've seen thus far. They're also backed by a lot of characters and a constant feeling of escalating power. 
This is where the show struggles. I feel like just like the dragging cliche, a Shounen's incapability to escape rising action is plaguing the entire genre.
By rising action I mean the base idea of any storytelling. To ramp up the story by raising consequences and stakes to create a tenser environment. This show, along with its shounen family, don't understand when too far is too far. 
This shows with its character introductions. By introductions I mean two possible ways a character can be introduced. 
1.) They walk in and one of our characters talk about how ""their aura is the strongest they've ever seen, they are so scary!"" And that gets repeated a few hundred times. 
2.) They job. By job, I mean when a previously established powerful characters gets his/her ass swiftly beaten by this new character. This happens to establish the fact that this new character is a level above anything they expected!
While number two is a viable way to approach an introduction once or twice... I felt as though this is how the show introduced almost every character. When it wasn't number two, it was number one, which is even worse. 
Every character felt like the show was trying hard to ratchet up the stakes and at one point it just became too much. The show hit its diminishing returns and it looped back and all this energy the show has spent making this character seem cool and bad-ass was thrown back in its face. It became a cheesy mess. 
FMA:Brotherhood did this with its absolutely hilarious shark-jumping finale that was so ""out there"" and overblown that I was laughing at it. It was dumb. HxH does this too at one point. It really puts a damper on the whole thing and it makes you realize that you are in fact watching a power fantasy for a kid, rather than a show just focused on being a good show. 
Mind you I'm not against kids shows. I believe every piece of entertainment can be amazing. Its just how it breaks free of a lot of cliches that plague it. As well as the amount of effort and time the creators invest into making it engaging and unique for everyone. 
_______________________________
[PART 6]: An Ant in a Parade 
I promised that i'll talk about this shows final arc. I'll keep it relatively spoiler free, only mentioning character names and one aspect of the story. The Chimera Ant arc is the shows longest arc. It spans upwards of sixty episodes and presents a completely new world for the characters in this show to play with.
New and more powerful players are introduced again, and new rules are established. Thankfully the rules are more simple this time. The characters need to stop an invasion. 
With that in mind, I was digging the arcs slower pace as well as its focus on developing the main characters. It felt like a slow burn that I was actually enjoying. The show became darker and the themes became more mature. The political commentary was a little on-the-nose, but the creator of the show really does demonstrate how he has a lot of knowledge on a lot of things. 
This enjoyable arc which I, at the time, was called ""The show coming into its own"", also introduced my favorite character. The King. A sympathetic villain that became the shows diamond in the rough. A seemingly horrible being that goes through a personality crisis.
However, this is where the show stops. On literally the 100th episode of the show. Our protagonists launch an attack on the invaders and here we get thirty five.... THIRTY FIVE episodes of nonstop fighting. 
And while that may sound cool to someone, let me reiterate. ELEVEN HOURS of Shounen action. This means we get re-used footage, still images, and incredibly cheesy moments for eleven fucking hours. Apart from a highlight or two, these thirty-five episodes were damn near unbearable. 
Everything was dragged out to a point of unbelievably, every character given enough cheese to fill up a... cheese... factory. And worst of all, it was BORING. Every piece of dialogue was perfunctory. Every emotional breakthrough was so long that halfway through you just stop caring and hope that they move on. Every second of action was prefaced with five minutes of exposition regarding a characters power. I can't be the only one who thinks that explaining your power to the villain is fucking stupid. 
While this arc has an absolutely remarkable ending. An ending that I think was so good and so heartbreaking that I felt like this show didn't deserve it. But for all the sadness I was feeling, a feeling of anger crept over my anime-fueled mind. 
The reason the ending was so good was because of The King and his relationship with another character. This character was given five episodes of screentime. Five. Five. Five fucking episodes. FIVE. 
They gave a stupid fucking invasion THIRTY FIVE episodes, yet the best part of the show, the one part of the show that I WANTED to see more of they cut short. This character was the reason The King became such a great character and this character was totally sidelined for the invasion. 
This infuriated me. I'm even angry thinking about it. Nothing is more angering than seeing a show wash away its potential due to its dumb focus. This is the pinnacle of that. 
But even with this massively squandered potential, even if that character only got five episodes to shine, and even if that characters prolonged presence could've made this ending EVEN BETTER, it was still good. 
That just goes to show you how good it could've possibly been... but I digress. The show has to stay within its Shounen family, for better... but mostly for worse. 
______________________________
[CONCLUSION] : The Shounen Election 
If you can't tell already, this show caused a pretty mixed reaction from me. On one hand we had beautifully done character designs, but on the other, we had mostly stilted and meandering animation. On one hand we had a few standout characters, on the other hand we had them bogged down by fights. On one hand we had Gon and Killua play realistic roles, on the other hand we had dramatic escalation to the extreme. 
Its mixed, but even if it is, I will say that I do not regret watching that. Even if I do honestly believe the show's story could've been told better in half its run-time, I still enjoyed it. 
For as frustrated as it made me, by the time the final episodes credits rolled I felt like I went on a journey in a world full of journeys. I felt like I saw enough character progression. I felt like there can be infinitely more stories to tell. I even felt a hint of sadness from the knowledge that I may never see these character again. 
For everything that this show put me through, I appreciate it. Its a show stuck in an infinite loop. A show that tries so very hard to break free of a lot of cliches that plague its genre. 
Much like someone drowning in the water, the show tried its best to kick its way to the surface and break through to yell and wave, ""Hey, look at me!"" In a sea of stilted Shounen-action anime, its there trying to get noticed. 
I think it just might have been.",6

                Ok guys this is my first review and it's on a show I'm sure many of you have either heard of, read or even watched it yourself. personally to me it would have to be my second favourite anime to have watched and I honestly can't stress to you guys enough to check it out. Ok now that's settled lets get onto the review!
The storyline is brilliant, it has your typical main character that's weak but eventually builds himself into a machine and you'd think that would get boring and generic right? No not in this show. The characters are developed so well you get
                  a liking to all of them even the so called villains or enemies I.e (hisoka, meruem and chrollo) it has good pacing not a fight every episode but a good mix between fillers, training so you see his progress and yeah it's great! 
Music brings a nice feel while listening to it, nothing amazing but it suits it well. The bond that gon makes with all of the people throughout the story shows what a great natured kid he is. My personal favourite characters would have to be killua and hisoka for their different styles of fighting and how they act. All together this gets a 10/10 I hope you guys weren't too bored reading this haha",10

                Hunter X Hunter, a story about a large variety of people and their exciting journeys to attain their greatest desires, some at a large cost.
I cannot gush enough about how great the soundtrack and animation was in this show, so I won’t. Simply know that I couldn’t see any problems with either one apart from minor quirks that are easily forgiven.
At its start, the series has a faster pace and is far more about being a light-hearted adventure, using the dynamic of the four main characters and action to grab your interest. Most importantly, it knows how to use action the correct way, as it
                  doesn’t rely on fights or gore alone to get an emotion out of you. Examples being leaps of faith into a cavern, sneaking up on dangerous opponents, trying to beat the clock, or escape from a nest of venomous vipers. Hunter X Hunter manages to be a great shounen that makes the best use it can of both tired tropes and original ideas. The show’s style of storytelling changes significantly as time goes by however. Towards the ending it slows down, exploring the thoughts of the character in greater detail, adding far more narration and flowery language. It makes it seem like you’re watching an animated novel rather than any ordinary series. While the narration and symbolism is used thoughtfully in the later parts of the Chimera Ant arc, the final Election arc suffers from having too much narration, telling you things rather than showing them. If you like or dislike this change is very much up to personal taste, as both ways of storytelling are used well for what they are.
Like many shounens, HxH comes with a large cast. Some characters are focused on to a great extent, some less so. Two particular cases, Leorio and Kurapika, were presented as part of the main cast yet are left out of several arcs, leaving you wishing their stories had some closure. In the end though I can’t say I wasn’t satisfied with how our other main characters reached their goals. 
What I found most interesting about the show was the way it developed characters in the Chimera Ant arc, where some very unconventional means were used to bring about its emotional end. I raged several times as it seemed the story was taking a turn for the worse, only to see that most of those moments would have a greater meaning later on. What brings HxH to such a high score is the fact that it taught me something about writing. The one thing most shocking to an audience isn’t character-death or such things, but rather extreme changes to a character. One can in fact use bad tropes to threaten a character’s development, engaging the audience, making us wish to see them find their way back to their piece of heaven.
Overall, the only things that bring the show down from being perfect are the characters that were left behind, and the less exciting politics of the last arc. I’d recommend it to all lovers of anime, adventure, and good writing. A must-see.",10

                Hunter x Hunter has an AMAZING and unpredictable plot. There are so many features which distinguish it from others:
1. All the arcs in the series are linked to each other
2. It does not portray the main character as the strongest
3. The story does not focus only on the main character 
4. Everything that happens makes perfect sense 
Still, I wonder, why is it placed at the sixth rank? I consider it even better than Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood. And I don't know how it can be ranked below Kimi no Na wa. Believe it or not, this is the best anime I've ever watched!

                What does it have to take an anime to be a perfect ten or masterpiece? A wonderful plot? A unexceptionally good art? A beautiful soundtrack? Characters that are lovable? An enjoyable anime that gives you unforgettable and happy moments which makes your ass laugh off? Want to find out? Then if you have time, try continue reading this review but if not, then it's okay of you skipped my review.
Hunter x Hunter (2011) is the completed and alternative version of the series HxH back in 1998 with better quality. The story is all about the adventures of four friends, I think you all know all
                  about the story since you have read the synopsis. You should NOT underestimate this anime. Don't be fooled by their looks. Even if the main protagonist, Gon, looks like a kid doesn't mean that this is a childish show. As you can see it's rated ""R-17+"" since it contains violence. Hunter x Hunter is a hidden gem (since a lot of people don't know this anime and it's really wonderful), a RARE shounen anime that comes into your life, an once-in-a-lifetime chance.
The art or drawing of this anime is really good, and the quality is simply one of the best, the creativity between colors gives out an outstanding view which makes you say ""Wow!"". Therefore, I gave it a 10.
Character development is simply amazing! You shouldn't underestimate the 2 young protagonists, they have a good relationship with each other which makes you think that this is what best friends are truly are. The development between the supporting and main grows which makes their bonds grow strong. But there's a teensy weensy problem and it's that I find the other characters annoying.
The sound... It was really catchy and you can really call the OP and ED an earworm. The ending songs are really exceptionally good, they picked the right sound at the right time. The OST was good.
My enjoyment of this anime is that it never lets me down and makes me beg more and more. This anime never fails me to laugh and cry, the thrills sent to my skin was really tense and the battles are like double-edged swords, never fails me to surprise and scream (which my neighbour hears).
Overall, this childish anime that you think of is not as kiddie as you think, this anime had already fooled me, I hated this anime before because I think it's childish but later on it became one of my favorites. You might not get interested because of their innocent face but as episodes pass by, you might reconsider them and think that they're really not that innocent after all. And of course I LOVE this anime.
The story wasn't rushed and the pacing is neither fast or slow, this is what you expect on a perfect anime.
I recommend you to watch this, if you want shounen, or battles with tense. But if you don't want to, then it's okay because I'm not forcing you to watch this magnificent masterpiece.

                How to be happy: watch Hunter x Hunter
How to be sad: finish Hunter x Hunter
This is one of those animes that leave you craving for more. (Yes, even after 148 episodes.) **Spoiler Free**
Story: 9
This is about a 12-year-old boy who sets out on a journey to find his father and become a Hunter like him. He's an unpolished diamond, but his character develops and refines as you continue to watch the series. There are many arcs in the story. And while my favourite is the Hunter Exam arc, the rest of the arcs still make you want to click, ""Next Episode"" repeatedly until it's 1am.
                  At first, I thought it was a kid's show, but as you continue watching, it's definitely not for kids. It's pretty violent; don't watch it if you don't like blood.
Art & Character: 10
The art is very diverse and unique for each character. No two characters are alike. The character designs suit the characters very well. (e.g. Hisoka's character design is similar to a clown, since his power involves playing cards.) The background is just right; it's not too detailed. Each character is unique in design, and in personality. You'll fall in love with at least one of the main characters. 
Sound: 10
I seriously loved everything. The OPs, the EDs and the soundtrack altogether.  It's perfection. It fitted in the scenes perfectly; nothing was out of place. The voice actors/actresses did an amazing job. Their voices fit the characters like a glove.
Enjoyment: 10
I was so sad and hung up on HxH when I finished it. I couldn't find a new anime to watch, because I was obsessed with HxH. I usually watch shoujo animes; this shounen anime was a new genre for me. I didn't regret anything.
Overall: 10",10

                Have you ever dreamt about doing something completely unorthodox and new, something that would carry with itself many delightful situations and beautiful memories, a certain decision that would make you encounter many people, learn about different cultures or even change your life, make yourself discover new things about yourself or the world around you? Many people from different times, places, carrying different beliefs or cultures are bounded with one burning and adventurous desire that ultimately defines their audacious nature – to Discover. The title Hunters are people driven by that uncontrolled passion, to the point, where they are ready to leave their previous jobs and
                  lives behind to fulfill their ambitions. Hence, the Hunter’s license opens the door for many different jobs, inaccessible places and opportunities. It’s a prestigious title, that carries with itself strenght, flair and it’s treacherous temper, to the point where many people are ready to put their life on stake and gather to choose the most matched and worthy of calling himself as a Hunter. There can be many reasons: lust, money, ambition, or simple desire – to discover. Neither one of them drives the protagonist of the story. 12 years old Gon Freecs believes there must be a reason for his father leaving him to live as a Hunter, other than just being a douchebag. Hence, his adventure to find him and discover the harsh world, by becoming a Hunter begins with a big decision that follows every discovery.
Sounds mediocre, right? Can’t blame for that. The term of “Adventure” is mainly overused in the various forms of popculture and media taking away it’s appeal and making it sound average. We’ve all seen stories with that main word on stake – primarly in shows aimed to younger viewers - following the same and frequently seen tropes, making unable to surprise the viewer anymore. How a piece with so weakly presented and unoriginal premise of the story be so acclaimed and loved by both critics and fans, to the point where experienced viewers of the anime medium are surprised with cleverness of the story and place it among their most favourite shows? The main reason behind that is how the story is being executed during it’s airing and the powerful usage of cunning writing of Yoshihiro Togashi visible as the show progreses.
Nearly all shounens in anime history are basing on cliché formulas and tropes, predictable action and unimaginative plot completely withdrawing it’s charm to eventually become tedious and uncaptivating. As a matter of fact Hunter x Hunter breaks and deconstructs every formula we got used to in the genre, being the superiorance of main protagonist or cliché character interactions, creating something extremely charming, making it something more than just a shounen anime. It’s visible where the show begin to split the moral lines between protagonists and antagonists. It’s normal for shounen “bad guys” to soften and understand their mistake, eventually teaming with the “good guys”, Hunter x Hunter however, goes further, fleshing out it’s villains not in a way we’re used to in fiction, forcing the audience to reconsider their measurement of good and evil ultimately making the viewer unsure of righteousness of the ""good side”.
Perfectly balancing between the main goal of the story and the subsidiary plots, the show slowly creates a bigger picture with them, without losing the sight from the goal, as it quickly takes place in One Piece. Fluently portraying new fleshed out characters to the story, pushing the plot forward, while constantly keeping the cunning and intelligent narrative, portraying creative and and imaginative outcomes for characters’ actions, presents unconventional worldbuilding adding lots of exoticity to the modern civilization and the nature, with more government authority visible, introducing the most creative and set out power system ever created, giving limitless options and infinite usage of it not only in the show, but also being a nice food-for-imagination for those dedicated enough to invent something on their own. It is not afraid to show the main characters fail or place them in extreme situations, when winning isn’t always solving the problem and battles becoming more of psychological contests than rumbling, when using strategy in a crafty way and outsmarting your enemy is what means victory – which leads to a question if the raw power the only measurement of strenght, or can it also be found in many different aspects in life? - hence making the encounters even more tense, as the show constantly keeps it’s best cards in hiding, creating a false ensure of safety, completely overturning the viewers expectations and eventually leaving the viewer speechless with the final outcome. 
Hunter x Hunter: 2011, while not carrying much artistic values, nor revolutionizng the medium is still a profound story delving from cheerful plot to powerful analysis of humanity, strategy contests and ponderings about morality and human decisions, and is the testimony of Yoshihiro Togashi’s creativity. It sets standards not only for the shounen genre, while being one of the most entertaining shows, always staying unpredictable and cunning, making it easy to marathon it and keeping top-notch production values despite of it’s length, which is the very evidence of Madhouse workmanship. Nonethless it’s a flawed work. The fact that the original source has not ended doesn’t help with the fact that author’s writing bases on not fully explaining or fleshing out some of the themes or leaving questions unanswered giving the author a bigger field to write the story in the future, while judging the anime adaptation alone it may appeal to be nothing more than just a plot hole. Even though the story still continues in the manga, the show beautifully ends leaving the viewer with a bittersweet taste as if it was the real ending of the story.
A certain work of fiction – while giving some sort of message - may therapeutically resonate with you or your current situation, giving you more positive outlook on certain circumstances. That has been the case with Hunter x Hunter. Telling a story of optimism and persistence - as shounen anime usually used to do – Hunter x Hunter highly encourages to aim bigger, but in the most reliable way i've ever encountered in anime, not giving a naive perspective of being the center of the world, but still not losing the child inside you despite of your age and seeking what drives you to become passionate, which at the end of it all gives such an obvious message (when in the beginning of the story seemed to set off unappealing) that turns around the main theme of the show. It tells how vast the world and it’s not logical to naturally understand it all, while giving that microscopic feeling of having infinitely larger amount of options and capabilities than what it appears to be at first, having a big amount of time to enjoy getting from one point to another. It wouldn’t necessarily matter how prestigious your title or degree is or how much money you earn, but how much experience and knowledge you received along the way and how much passion drove you to ultimately become like this. There is much to see and do despite our mistakes and hardships we endure along the way, the journey is ultimately what shape the very person you become, which is why Hunter x Hunter is so meaningful. If you haven’t watched this enormously large show, consisting of 148 episodes, don’t be hesitating to check it – not to ultimately finish it and get rid of it, but to enjoy what is between the end of it, because that is where Hunter x Hunter truly shine.",9

                TL;DR
Hunter x Hunter was in short, a lent down. 
Why did I find it a disappointment? ...The reason is because about 25% of the story I found interesting. The rest was straight up boring. 
Great battles and fights scenes though. 
No fillers
Nicely animated
STORY: 5
About a really strong (for unknown reason) 12 year old wanting to become a hunter to search for his father who's also a hunter. Throughout the series, it starts with Gon taking the hunter exams, trying to find his dad, training, making friends, and running into baddies along the way. 
I'm okay with that. It's mostly about how well the story is going to be executed that will determine if it's interesting or not. Well..... I was bored. A lot of the scenes felt like I wanted to fast forward through them. There are currently 7 Arcs, and I only enjoyed Yorknew Arc, and latter half of Chimera Ant arc. Those two arcs were worth watching. As for the rest, it just felt like I was watching fillers with boring ass bad guys & other lame stuff. *shrugs*  Maybe a few scenes here and there that were interesting, but most of the time it was dull for various reasons such as I found the characters being introduced dull, or the events/scene to be dull.
I also didn't like that Gon and Killua were so strong for their age. It just didn't feel too believe-able. For one of the arcs, a bunch of really strong bad guys show up, and instead of calling in more professionals, they let these somewhat unknown, albeit strong, but still inexperienced kids get involved? I don't know man..... Things just don't feel right at times.  
This show's got great battles! If you want shounen for the battles, then HxH is the way to go. The fights aren't just about brawn/strengths but rely on tactics and is well thought out sometimes. This is one of the pros to HxH.
ART: 8
The style is simple, not much different than the average anime look. Just depends on what you like. One thing I appreciated was that the characters aren't overly sexualized. Overall, some plain character designs. That's ok. It's about the story. The animation quality on the other hand, is excellent. High quality animated fight scenes and non fight scenes. So yeah, that was nice.
SOUND: 7
CHARACTER: 6
I only liked a small handful of characters honestly. The rest were...meh or forgettable. 
ENJOYMENT: 6
I'm not enjoying the overall story or the journey thus far. The end goal being reached left an unsatisfying feel for me, and felt anti-climatic.
*********SPOILER *********
I'm talking about the part where Gon finally meets his dad. His goal was to become a hunter and find his dad. They made it seem like it was going to be so fking difficult to track/find him. But nope, he's right there. And how they met up was ....hmmm.....boring? I wish it had been written a little better there, because that was supposedly a huge milestone for the story right? But the way it played out was pretty much uneventful, and kinda lame to be honest. 
******END OF SPOILER ******
Ah well maybe it's just me being picky. 
Other than the 2 arcs mentioned earlier, the rest of HxH just felt bland. I don't understand the praise.
OVERALL: 6.7 ≈ 7
I think Hunter x Hunter is a good shounen (especially for the battles), but personally, I think it's overrated. The story is what brought it down for me. This is subjective, but had it been 5/7 instead of 2/7 arcs that kept me interested, have that ""specific event"" better executed, and more interesting characters, I would've probably given it a 9.
That said, I'm not a huge of shounen fan, so this review might be better for people like that.  However, if you're a big fan of shounen/Naruto, give it a try. You'll probably enjoy it more than I did.",7
"
                First of all, I'm giving this a 1 because it is GROSSLY overrated.
HxH starts off well and is actually an interesting story early on. But the quality in story falls off horribly and enjoyment becomes extremely low (I'd rate it negatively if I could) once the chimera ant arc starts and from there on.
It drags and drags and drags and drags and drags (you get the point) and drags on. I can't enjoy a story like this, especially if it's boring on top of being super long. If you like unnecessarily long plots, then boy are you going to enjoy this. I prefer stories that tell
                  themselves with ease and wrap things up nicely as opposed to making you wait and throwing in a whole bunch of filler. I prefer other high quality stories in 20-40 episodes as opposed to the large quantity of BS that HxH progressively throws at its audience.
This overrated crap doesn't deserve recognition and certainly not the rating.",1
"
                An anime with a lot of potential but destroyed by greed. The animation is solid trough the entire series with the music being good but repetitive. Character design is good as well with no unnecessarily sexualized characters and fan service. First 75 episodes are well paced and with no fillers except the recap episodes. But after that point the lack of source material was obvious with the prolonging every point with repetition and heavy narration even for the most obvious things in the story and having narrator describe everything in heavy detail. This makes it painfully hard to watch so I would recommend for everyone
                  to find on the internet a list of episodes you can skip if you want to watch it. This series would probably have an 8/10 grade without that, but since it lasts for so long I can't ignore it and it really ruins the whole experience. I would recommend waiting for the next iteration of the anime.",6
"
                Hunter x Hunter has changed my life.
My entire life I have always been indulging in and in pursuit of works of art and fiction, whether it be film, music, books, or even anime. After experiencing and watching works of fiction my entire life, upon gradual reflection, I came to recognise that many of my philosophies and ideologies had already become immensely intertwined with the world and messages that can be found in that of anime and other works of fiction, inspiring my abundant contemplations regarding human existence – in all its glory, and in all its shame. Whether it be; the ability to see splendour
                  in even the most hopeless circumstances, the importance of never losing sight of one’s goals that is emphasised through masterful works of shounen, the appreciation of authentic relationships that proliferates one’s desire to discover love that resembles all that they are in their values and desires, or even the inevitable tragedy that sometimes awaits those of us who are just stumbling through life – a truthful reflection on the malice and unfairness that echoes vociferously in our very own reality. 
But, most importantly, what is it that truly grants our lives meaning, fuelling our tenacities and yearnings. What is it about us, as a race, that permits such complexity and duplicity in our morals, our beliefs, our actions and our overall subsistence? In other words, what gives us the endless predisposition to evolve and grow – our propensity for ‘evil’ or our intrinsically compassionate nature. The idea of a sense of morality that exists and is accepted is an idea that is challenged in the most unique and interesting work of fiction that I have experienced to this day – Hunter x Hunter, which not only explores morally ambiguous subject matters on a profoundly philosophical level but also effectually weaves these controversial notions into the cordially appreciated shounen genres of adventure, fantasy and action that are juxtaposed with the progressively darker themes of crime, war and corruption that Togashi (the mangaka) gradually eases us into through the various arcs. In such a way, Hunter x Hunter effectively explores ideas intrinsic to the human psyche, offering a perfect contrast between light and dark themes, communicating humanities’ innate duality as we are creatures both capable of what is deemed morally “good’ and “evil.” 
I started watching Hunter x Hunter upon hearing others describe it as one of the most intricate and sophisticated works of all time. Initially, I could not understand why the show was highly praised due to its slow and somewhat generic start. A boy who wants to find his father. Despite finding the hunter world rather interesting and multi-faceted, I did not truly comprehend how well-written the show was until about thirty episodes in, where it suddenly hit me that everything was fitting into place incredibly well as the story continued, with many fights and key moments being so unpredictable as it completely dismantled what one would expect in a shounen anime, making me constantly pressed to know more. 
The concept of ‘Nen’ is extremely detailed and well-established and effectively enhances every aspect of the Hunter world. This is done through elaborate theoretical explanations on the Nen principles as well as the variety of practical applications which are presented throughout the show, frequently enabling Togashi to express the versatility of nen powers that are ingeniously a reflection of each character’s personality, contributing another layer of complexity to his comprehensive characterisation. Hunter x Hunter often takes a deconstructuralist approach to previous shounen anime, challenging traditional shounen tropes in its unconventional approach to not only its characters, but overall story. Such an example would be how the protagonists are not given special treatment – often being unable to win against someone even despite extensive training or determination. The use of “flashbacks” and “backstory” to induce emotion based powerups prevalent in the shounen genre and “power fantasy” anime is completely overlooked. ‘Nen’ alone is shown to hold no real influence on the outcome of a battle and many a time, a significant amount of attention given to tactical, physical, psychological and circumstantial aspects of the battle which also significantly shapes the outcome of any situation – often resulting in the protagonists being completely outmatched due to their lack of experience and skill. Furthermore, the sustained balance between consequence and power enables Togashi to retain a sense of realism in his work, enhancing the concept of nen that becomes more powerful the more restrictions placed upon it – a compensation for inexperience that many characters end up relying on – adding to its versatility, but also creating a sense of foreboding in the story due to the sheer severity and weight of the impending consequences. 
Additionally, the traditional idea of a build-up in tension that eventually culminates in a fight between the main protagonist, Gon, and the antagonists of each arc which would ultimately result in the protagonists victory – necessary to uphold what the protagonist and by extension, the audience, deems morally “right” – is completely undermined as Togashi conveys a sense of moral ambiguity in his characters. This makes the outcome of each arc unpredictable as the ethical boundaries between the protagonists and antagonists are consistently distorted, consequently forcing the audience to reconsider who is truly morally “right” in each circumstance, or whether such a faultless distinction even exists at all. The extent to which Togashi recognises the significance of story structure and correlation between arcs can be seen through his excellent pacing which allows him to effectively flesh out and develop each character, composing both protagonists and antagonists as multi-layered individualities whose behaviours as well as nen abilities are seen to be a reflection of their personalities and personal philosophy. Combined with this, smooth transitions between each arc and subplot work together with everything else to effectively world build as well as to underscore the experience of the “journey” and all the “little detours” that make the journey so special.
I believe where Hunter x Hunter truly shines is its multi-dimensional approach to the construction of all its characters. Every single character is shown to have their own unique identity, dreams, ambitions, and ideologies; all of which influence their personality and subsequent behaviours. Unlike other archetypal shounen villains, most of which have limited development throughout the duration of the show in order to add weight to the protagonist’s victory and to uphold universal ethical standards, Togashi’s characterisation of the “antagonists” in the story are shown to be just as developed, fascinating and multidimensional as the protagonists, constructing them in such a way that sheds moral ‘labels’ and fleshing them out in a manner that enables extensive character growth that at times completely alters the whole course of the story. Togashi’s refusal to ‘moralise’ in his execution of majority of the villains and protagonists in Hunter x Hunter makes the story all the more interesting, showing Togashi’s understanding regarding our innate propensity for both “good” and “evil” and how many a time there is no tangible distinction. Togashi persists in his upheaval of traditional shounen plot structure as he reveals that even the protagonists can just as easily become consumed with despair and morally unclear in their behaviour. 
The sound used in Hunter x Hunter is consistent throughout the entire show. The soundtracks are used effectively as a means to enhance the story and is able to convey the necessary moods and tones of each arc – with darker and lighter musical variances, often at time using a combination of both dark and light tones to add to the layer of intricacy in each specific situation and individual. The voice acting is executed effectively, especially in the main characters of the show – they are able to truly communicate the emotions and experiences of each character. 
The animation of Hunter x Hunter is also extremely consistent, clear and picturesque. Backgrounds are animated with detail and the colour tones are utilised in parallel with the tones of the scene or overall arc, with the use of a darker, muted colour palette in thematically darker arcs in comparison to a brighter, colourful colour palette in the more light hearted scenes – there is a perfect balance.
Overall, Hunter x Hunter is a masterpiece. Despite all my years of indulging in countless works of fiction, Hunter x Hunter truly stands out as a hidden gem. However, due to the lack of power fantasy material that is prevalent amongst the more popular shounen anime in Hunter x Hunter, its childish appearance, as well as (at times) its content/theory heavy approach, it is often overlooked and underappreciated. Even so, the detailed, intricate and masterful approach that Togashi takes in his writing really shines through his execution of the story as well as the characters, many details are so well thought-out that each time I unearth one, I am once again amazed by Togashi’s genius, brought to life by Mad House’s amazing execution – all of which work together to hit home the real message of the show. 
~ Never forget that the little detours are what makes the journey truly special, because that’s where you’ll find the things more important than what you want. ~",10

                You know how everybody keeps saying that there is nothing they can say about Hunter x Hunter that hasn’t been said before? Well, they’re all right. While this is technically a review of Hunter x Hunter, this should probably be treated more like a memoir of my thoughts on the show. If you want a really detailed review that thoroughly dissects all of the odds and ends of Hunter x Hunter, you might as well read its most helpful MAL review.
Now, what is it about Hunter x Hunter that makes it so special? At face value, there really isn’t anything going on that makes it
                  stand out. The initial conflict isn’t very innovative, and for a while, it seems like it’s on the same level as other shounen. It should be said that I am very familiar with long-running shounen. I have seen all of Naruto, all of Bleach, and even though it’s not on my list, I have seen 20-30 episodes of Fairy Tail, 40-50 episodes of One Piece, and at least 200 episodes of Naruto Shippuuden. I’ll say here that I will make lots of comparisons between Hunter x Hunter and “the big three.” The reasons why Hunter x Hunter is so special among shounen, as well as anime in general, are very simple. Hunter x Hunter does things that other anime don’t do. Hunter x Hunter gets things that other anime don’t get. Hunter x Hunter goes places that other anime don’t go. Hunter x Hunter gets what a good story is. Hunter x Hunter gets what good characters are. Hunter x Hunter gets anime, and Hunter x Hunter gets people.
While I would normally start off talking about the story, I think I’ll start off talking about the characters. Now, the big three have humungous supporting casts, and so does Hunter x Hunter. The thing about Hunter x Hunter is that it uses its supporting cast in a much more effective way. For example, in Bleach, there are lots of soul reaper characters that get screen time sprinkled all throughout the series. It seemed like tons of these characters got an episode or two (or three) that consisted of either filler to provide backstory, or a fight scene with a forgettable bad guy where they would monologue and/or have flashbacks while fighting. Also, One Piece dedicated entire arcs to introducing supporting cast members. I think Naruto did a much better job at integrating backstories in a way that seemed to benefit the plot, but giving backstories to every single minor character grows very tiresome. Not only do all of the minor characters of Hunter x Hunter feel meaningful, they all just kind of slip into the plot without much effort. For example, in the fourth arc of the series, a group of body guards is assigned to protect someone. At first, it just seemed like Togashi wasted his thinking juices on creative designs for characters that wouldn’t make any difference in the story. By the time the arc was over, all of the guards felt important and all you really learned about them was their names. They were only in that one arc too! And later down the line when one of the characters would pop on screen for a few seconds, a lightbulb would blink in your head and you would remember them! By the way, while Hunter x Hunter does suffer from characters having monologues during fights to discuss their abilities, the problem is much less prevalent compared to the big three.    
Next, I’m going to talk a bit about the main cast, as well as some of the supporting cast members I felt stood out more. 
First up is Gon! Gon has a lot of characteristics you would expect from a young protagonist. He’s tough and talented, but not tough enough. To protect his friends and find his father, he’ll need powers that will take both work and experience to achieve. His friends and father are in fact the main things that push him. While becoming a hunter because his father was a hunter isn’t the most original thing in the world, the story does a good job at keeping that plot point in play. In fact, the beginning of just about every arc has something to do with Gon taking the next step to find his daddy. The arc would then find its own shape and Gon’s daddy quest would take the back seat for a bit before the next arc. I’ll hit on this again later, by the way.
Next is Killua, who in my opinion is the best character in the cast. Killua has the most fleshed out backstory out of everyone. He also has very intriguing character traits. While Gon’s problems are pretty easy to deal with, Killua has a whole family of problems (ba-dum-ch). His tale is one of coming of age and learning the meaning of friendship. Also, Gon and Killua form a tag team that stays together for pretty much the entire series.
The other two main characters are Leorio and Kurapika, of whom I will discuss at the same time. Gon, Killua, Leorio and Kurapika form kind of a fab-four during the first arc, but after that, Leorio and Kurapika kinda part ways. They both show up in the fourth arc, where Kurapika does some badass fighting. After that, Kurapika doesn’t get much more screen time while Leorio doesn’t make much of a difference to the story until the last arc. Both of them are still good characters even though they don’t get as much screen time as Gon and Killua, but I have one big problem with each of them. My deal with Kurapika is that his defining characteristic is his quest to avenge his clan, of which he is the lone survivor. We’ve seen that before. With Leorio, it’s that he probably wouldn’t have gotten to be a hunter without his buddies helping him out during the exam. Still, even though we never really see him fight someone, he gets a little clip down the line that reveals he has some fighting strength. 
My favorite supporting character would be Hisoka. He may be a “bad guy,” but he’s the kind of bad guy you root for. His motives for his “badness” are hidden for the duration of the series, but that only makes him more mysterious. Early on he takes interest in Gon because he sees his huge potential. Hisoka wants to see Gon grow up, get stronger, and then...??? Yeah, that’s for you to figure out for yourself. Anyway, he still isn’t the Madara Uchilla kind of villain whose goal is to enslave humanity for whatever reason. Hisoka shows up when he wants and does what he wants, only to slip back into the shadows…  
The last character, or characters, I want to talk about is the Phantom Troupe. The Phantom Troupe have this Akatsuki thing going on with a club full of criminals. Their motives are somewhat explained. The gist is that they are an elite bunch who want to steal stuff. Why they steal what they steal is for you to discover. The troupe is a prime example of having creative characters without dedicating twenty minutes of backstory to each one. Also, they all have really cool powers that you learn about by watching them fight, rather than having them monologue about their powers to their foes. And the last reason I like them is a good bridge over to my favorite thing about the characters of Hunter x Hunter: the depth of the villains.
I think that Hunter x Hunter has the overall best villains of any anime I’ve seen. Now, I have already talked about some general things I like about Hisoka and the Phantom Troupe, but all of the villains have certain characteristics that other anime villains don’t have. These characteristics are value for life and duty to one’s friends. Minor spoilers coming up btw. So, there is a point in the story where a Troupe member gets killed by a main character. After that, the rest of the Troupe mourn over their lost friend. Yes, friend! One of the members actually brings up the length of their friendship with the deceased. These criminals that have killed countless people have a level of depth that I have never seen in anime villains. Another example would be in the sixth arc of the series. The main villain of that arc is as bad as they could possibly come, and even he learns to love a person that is as very weak and feeble. It should also be noted that all of the bad guys in the sixth arc have a diverse pallet of emotions that is not seen elsewhere. 
After talking about the characters, it’s story time! I’m going to give some thoughts on each arc without spoiling anything. 
Arc 1: Easily the worst in the series. Well, I guess it’s not bad. It's actually kinda good. Still, everybody will tell you it’s a poor representation of the show, and they are all right. I actually had to force myself through some episodes. Still, it did set up some very important characters, as well as plant a seed for the rest of the series to grow from.
Arc 2: While it is technically an arc, it’s more like a short story to develop Killua’s character. It still isn’t wasted time, as it gives Hunter x Hunter the push it needs to get going.
Arc 3: This is my third favorite arc of the series. It’s where we really see the world of Hunter x Hunter develop. My main reason for liking it is that it is short, sweet and it gets a lot done. Coupled with some good battle sequences, it sets the foundation for the combat abilities of the characters.
Arc 4: It is what I think to be the best arc of the series, and many will agree. It introduces the Phantom Troupe and reveals the dark tone of Hunter x Hunter. Also, much more is at stake in this arc compared to the first three. 
Arc 5: It kind of lost me a bit. While it was certainly good, the shift in tone compared to the previous arc was a miss. It also seems to lack importance when compared to the other arcs. 
Arc 6: It is actually my fourth favorite, but many fans see it as their first favorite. All things considered, it is fantastic. However, the 61 episodes that it was left me exhausted, and there were a lot of episodes heavy on the narration side that kind of disrupted the arc’s flow. Still, it’s a fantastic arc with a fantastic story.
Arc 7: This arc was my second favorite, which is good, seeing how it is the last one in the series. The tone shift from the previous arc was very refreshing, and it gave me all of the things that I needed before Hunter x Hunter ended.
Now, about the actual story, Hunter x Hunter has a very cool way of doing things. The main conflict is Gon trying to find his dad, not that that is much of a conflict. What Hunter x Hunter does is use that as a guide for taking the characters to different places, proceeded by inventing a completely new conflict for the current setting. It’s almost like watching what would be considered filler arcs in other shounen, except they’re not filler arcs. The story of Hunter x Hunter had a billion directions it could have gone in, and the possibilities are still open.
The really great thing about Hunter x Hunter’s story is that it is not afraid of taking things too far. After the first arc, it seemed like a nice and happy children’s show. A couple of arcs later, the stuff on the screen had me think things like, “Oh…crap…that really just…happened.” I’m not saying that death and darkness is what makes a story good, but a story without fear of where it’s going is nothing but exciting. Also, few to none of the conflicts are solved through the power of friendship. It became clear early in the series that characters weren't able to do magic tricks and make a happy ending come out of nowhere. Knowing that pumps out lots of suspense into the air. 
Time to talk about the ending. Lots of people say the worst part of Hunter x Hunter is that it’s over. I kind of agree, but I also disagree. When I look at what we got, I think what we got was good. Has the story ended in the sense that an official ending has been announced? Well, no. It’s not called Hiatus x Hiatus for nothing. Still, I think if we got more, it could disrupt what is actually a pretty sound ending for a very good anime.
Time for the boring stuff. Does it look good? Visually it isn’t any different from the big three. Now, the soundtrack is very good. There are tons of tracks, and I love each one.
So, final verdict time. Hunter x Hunter is a huge journey. I certainly think it is worth the watch, but I would be lying if I said I’m sad that it’s over. I’m actually very happy to get to watching something else. Despite the score and praise I give it, it won’t get a very high place on my favorites because I don’t see myself re-watching it for a long time. I may re-watch the fourth arc at some point, but once again, it will be a while. Still, be sure to put this on your plan-to-watch list. Hunter x Hunter is something really special, and you won’t be able to understand that until you see it for yourself.",10

                I'm gonna keep this as short as possible, I avoided this series because it didn't seem like something id enjoy but popularity and the overall rating from the myanimelist community made me attempt to watch it and i loved the series. This series is Loved by many and hated by some who think its overrated but it isn't not at all but here is the review.
The story you can read the synopsis on it but basically it is the main character a young boy named Gon trying to look for his father and find out why he abandoned him and became a hunter instead of
                  taking care of him this is creates a long journey and has many obstacles spanning through the 148 episodes you see so much stuff in terms of everything adding to the story the journey, the path the development of everything just blows your mind by the end of the series because you see just how amazing everything was. It also shows friendship can truly conquer all.
Art- Great although it kinda has the ""big eyes"" kinda thing that i hate in anime its very good i mean madhouse was one of the producers so that's enough to tell ya its great in terms of art, animation and overall everything. 8/10
Sound- Great although i don't really pay attention when it comes to sound,music etc. 148 episodes really make the music get into your head, Hunter X Hunter has a great OST a lively opening and a great ending along with very good voice acting spanning for all characters even the minor ones in each individual story arc overall 8/10.
Character- Every character spanning through main and minor have a story within individual story arcs and it is a great sight to watch also it has many many characters so its expected to find some great development through many of them which you do get. You'll even get feels from villain moments because of how great each character is developed throughout the anime length and throughout the story arcs.
Enjoyment- 10/10 Nothing more to say.
Overall- 10/10 Best anime i have ever watched although not my favorite i will say its the best from the 59 anime that i have watched. Awesome action scenes, psychological scenes for those type of viewers, Loving sibling scenes (towards the end), Friendship, Comedy, Drama, Adventure, Feels i mean everything you could want from an anime you can get in this.",10

                Hunter x Hunter is a long running action adventure shonen anime originally created by Yoshihiro Togashi & re-adapted in 2011 by powerhouse studio Madhouse. Hunter x Hunter is rather famous here on MAL, it’s currently the 4th highest rated anime on this sight with an average score of 9.12. Well damn, that’s some really high praise, lets see if it lives up to that praise. Probably gonna be some spoilers, be prepared. 
Story:10/10
The story of Hunter x Hunter is a sprawling epic laid out over a series of 7 arcs. We begin with our main protagonist Gon, Gon decides he wants to become a Hunter
                  so that he can find his dad, who left him in the hands of Mito, a friend of Gon’s dad. Gon then meets up with Leorio, Kurapika, & later on his soon to be life long partner Killua. These 4 all go and take on the Hunter exams together. Once the hunter exams are all over everyone goes out to embark on their own adventures. What makes HxH’s story work so well is the sheer scale of the world that the main 4 (particularly Gon & Killua) traverse throughout their journey. The locations are all full of variety, & introduce us to some great characters with their own stories to tell. My favorite arcs in the series are Greed Island & Yorknew City, I like Greed Island because of Bisky’s training of both Gon & Killua. Greed Island the game is also an interesting setting with some excellent world design, good/interesting game mechanics, a strong villain, & a cathartic payoff at the end of the arc. Phantom Troupe being my other favorite because of 2 things primarily, Kurapika’s development & resolve, along with the Phantom Troupe themselves. From beginning to end every arc, while not as equally good as one another, offer engaging storylines, sublime character moments/development, good episode structure, & payoff. The final thing I have to bring up in my point about why Hunter x Hunter’s story is so good is the pacing. Hunter x Hunter has some of the best pacing I’ve seen out of a long running shonen adventure series like this. Scenes rarely ever drag, the fights usually stay in one episode & only go on for multiple episodes after a long build-up to a point where the multiple episode battles (particularly the final 25 or so episodes of Chimera Amt when the team storms the castle) feels earned. 
Characters: 10/10
Hunter x Hunter has excellent characters. Main, supporting, major, minor, the characters of Hunter x Hunter all offer something to the series. The main 4 offer great dynamics between one another. Gon is the innocent somewhat idiotic character, this is a great contrast to the dark & violent world of Hunter x Hunter. Killua serves as the straight man to Gon’s idiot, Killua is the more serious character who keeps Gon in check whenever Gon steps out of line. Killa goes through some great development about learning what friendship means, how to open up himself, & becoming a more sympathetic character as the series goes on. Kurapika was part of a tribe who was later wiped out due to the value of their eyes. It’s later revealed that the phantom troupe (more on them later) were responsible for the massacre of Kurapika’s tribe so he decides to become a Hunter so that he can become stronger, gain more experience both in combat & general world knowledge, to later take on the phantom troupe & seek vengeance for his tribe. I already mentioned it in my story segment, but Kurapika’s character growth & resolve in the Yorknew City arc elevated him to my second favorite character of the series. Our final of the main 4 is Leorio, the fool with a heart of gold. Leorio becomes a Hunter so that he can gain money in order to go to med school & become a doctor & help people because his friend died from a curable disease, yet Leorio couldn’t do anything about it because he didn’t have the medical knowledge to know how to cure his friend. The motivations driving each character, along with the development that everybody gets to go through (even if Leorio’s is unfortunately pretty minimal due to his lack of screentime in the grand scheme of the series). I must also mention side heroes such as the aforementioned Bisky, Knuckle, Wing, Zushi, & many more. Much like our main heroes, these guys contribute majorly to not just the development of Gon & Killua, but the development of the plot as well. They’re fleshed out beings with their own stories to tell. 
All of the villains in the series are also great, from the Phantom Troupe in Yorknew City, the Chimera Ants, the Bombers in Greed Island, every villain in this series is full of character & all have their own stories to tell & their own challenges to offer to the heroes. The Phantom Troupe are a group of people who do bad things, but they all look out for one another & become genuinely upset & unsettled at the thought of one of their members getting taken out by “The Chain User”. The Chimera ants, even the minor ones offer something. Take Rammot for example, he’s not around for very long in the arc, but his encounter with Gon & Killua made him angry about the fact that he couldn’t beat them, so he gains a desire to become even stronger & defeat his new found foes. It’s simple, but it’s effective because it not only shows the desire for growth, but the fact that the Chimera Ants are a greater threat than we thought, Gon & Killua did struggle to defeat him after all. There’s too many villains in this series for me to name off one by one, but a commonality between all of them is that they're fleshed out & written as characters, not evil villains.
Art: 10/10
Hunter x Hunter is without a doubt in my mind, the most consistently high quality long running shonen adventure series in both its sheer visual prowess & animation. The environments in Hunter x Hunter look really good because of the landscapes & the color of the world. The colors make the world pop & the lighting only further adds to this. Hunter X Hunter is never too bright or too dark in each scene respectively. Animation is impressive, while Hunter x Hunter is one of those series in which a lot of the scenes are comprised of static shots where the characters are just sitting around talking with the mouth flaps rarely matched up because that’s just the way animation works unless you’re the Monogatari Series. This really isn’t a flaw, as these more static scenes still bring with them some great shot compositions that don’t make the scenes completely uninteresting to look at. Also helping these scenes are the surrounding environments having things going on in the background, so it’s not like these shots are completely uninteresting, I will admit, there are sometimes shots in Hunter x Hunter that are completely uninteresting, but these are negligible as they never last for very long, & their pretty forgettable in the grand scheme, so it’s not like they hold these shots for a long time or anything.
The action directing in Hunter X Hunter is some of the best that TV animation can offer. There are so many great moments in the directing that lead to memorable fights. Take Gon vs Hisoka as Heaven’s Arena for example, at one point Hisoka punches Gon in the face with a hook, & the camera then moves to Gon’s face whilst the background is spinning. It’s a nice shot that demonstrates Gon’s frustrations while keeping the show moving. Another good example of directing would be in the Chiemra Ant arc when the good guys are storming the castle to try & take on the Chimera Ant king. We open with a shot that opens on the Good Guys entering through a portal that Know left by the staircase in an earlier episode. The next shot showcases the villain that our heroes are going to have to fight as they didn’t intend on him being by the staircase, in this case Pouf. The scene then plays out in slow motion for a bit switching between close ups of a good guy, then pouf, & then a good guy again. This sequence of events is excellent because it establishes the beginning of the invasion, the threat that our heroes are going up against, & the determination of the good guys to complete their mission. I can go on all day naming off these moments but that would only serve to pad this review even further, so for now I’ll contain myself & just say “Yeah, Hunter x Hunters action directing is some of the best that TV anime can offer & has so many groundbreaking moments throughout the series”.
Sound: 10/10
The voice acting is an all around sublime effort from everybody. Megumi Han as Gon, Miyuki Sawashiro as Kurapika, Ayumi Fujiwara as Pitou, Daisuke Namikawa as Hisoka. Really, everybody brings a great effort & continuously improves their performance as the show goes along. Don’t get me wrong, their performances aren’t bad at the beginning, I’m just saying, it starts strong, and it only gets stronger from there.The sound design is also really good. Punches, comedic sfx, rubble, nen, the sound design does a great job at keeping everything tied together & making sure everything leaves an impact, so I have no further comments to make on Hunter x Hunter having excellent sound design.
The music is so damn good. A common criticism I hear about Hunter x Hunter is that the series becomes too expository at points. While I can understand the frustration (I myself hate expository dialogue when it’s used incorrectly). Music from the freaking kick ass OST that is this anime will usually play in the background to distract from the exposition, so it rarely, if ever gets boring to hear these characters talk because the music is well placed & is just used so well. I also have to give a shout-out to ending theme 5 (the 2nd Chimera Ant ending theme). Such a great piece that fits the arc perfectly. It starts off nice & slow replicating the build-up to the invasion, then it builds up to represent the invasion taking place, couldn’t have been placed any better.
Overall: 10/10
So that’s Hunter X Hunter. It is absolutely deserving of the spot & reputation its received over the course of 9 years. Its story is a sprawling, globe trotting epic. It takes simple premises & makes complex storylines & characters out of them. The characters are extremely well written & offer their own stories & challenges. The development of both the plot & characters is phenomenal. The structure is on point. The action directing is some of the best that TV anime has ever seen. Every arc is at its minimum an 8/10 or above. The pacing is some of the best I’ve seen out of a long running shonen adventure series like this. It’s a brilliant series Yoshihiro ToGODshi hit it out of the park with this one. With as much praise as I’ve given this one, it’s of course going to receive a 10/10.",10

                Story: 10/10
The transitioning from arc to arc is smooth and the build up is also very good. The pacing is also good. The only part that felt slow was the invasion part of the CA arc, but it is understandable, so I will give it a pass.
Art: 10/10
Although the art in the manga isn't the best (personally, I find it to be good), the anime makes it much better and the colors are also very nice. The animation is also one of the best in battle shonen.
Sound: 10/10
The OST is great and fits well with the series. The OP is recycled for all the episodes,
                  but it is one of the best. Usually, I skip the OP, but not for Hunter x Hunter. 
Characters: 10/10
Great character development for all the main characters. Even side characters are great. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
I enjoyed Hunter x Hunter a lot. Tuesdays won't be the same anymore. 
Overall: 10/10
Overall, Hunter x Hunter gets a 10/10",10

                “Qualification isn't something we have to talk about. The ones who are not okay with their success can go through training until they are.” - Gon Freecss
To me, Hunter x Hunter (2011) is one of the most enjoying animes I've watched in quite a while. For an anime that essentially has it all, the lack of popularity surrounding it leaves me quite wistful. Though this may be the case, those who've had the opportunity to watch it, like me, have most certainly been able to enjoy it to its utmost extent. Hunter x Hunter (2011) is most definitely one of the greatest Shounens to ever
                  surface the Earth.
First off is the story. Since you've already read the synopsis, I'll tell you this. Hunter x Hunter is definitely not what you'd expect from its summary. This anime had far exceeded my expectations the first time I'd watched it. HxH is compromised of 7 total arcs, all in which are extremely well-written and is one of the greatest aspects of this anime. The start of the anime may seem mundane at first, but picks up very fast. Each of the arcs are highly impressive, and shift from one to the next like a chain reaction. This in turn gives HxH its great depth and flow, that which you don't see as much in most Shounens.
The story progression in HxH is practically non-stop. Aside from two recap episodes, there are no fillers in the anime. The series gives its viewers a wide opportunity to many different environments and appeals. From survival, fighting tournaments, mafia and crime, virtual reality, humanoids, to war and politics, HxH offers countless stories that surprisingly shift easily from one to another. As each arc is practically unpredictable, you'll never get bored from the show. I myself, who had just recently finished it, watched the whole series within less than a week. 
The more you watch of Hunter x Hunter, the faster you start to realize that its concepts and writing are more than just child's play. In actuality, HxH is at times exceedingly dark, with heavy atmosphere and dreary developments. The emotions and deaths of characters at times like these will leave you quite literally bawling. But with the dark moods always comes the happy-go-lucky rays of sunshine. These times in the series honestly left me happy that I finished the anime because Hunter x Hunter just wouldn't be the same without them. There isn't a single moment in the anime you'd want to miss.
Moving aside, we have the anime's art. Its art and animation is completely outstanding. No once while I was watching it could I point out a single mishap. For a long running Shounen anime with 148 episodes, it holds highly for keeping its great animation throughout the whole series. The quality of Hunter x Hunter from episode to episode gives it its own unique charm, especially the quality animation of its fight scenes. Background, character animation, show of emotion, lighting, and everything else is quite simply flawless.
Next we have the sound. As for this, the HxH soundtrack is quite fitted for the series. Each scene is perfectly fitted with its corresponding ost. Besides a few minor characters, the voice acting of the anime is well befitting. You'd never think that the characters' voices weren't their original.
Finally, we have our characters. If there is one thing I would need to emphasize, its this. The number of characters in HxH is huge, but they all have their own personalities, quirks, opinions, and ambitions. And in all of it, the characters don't follow the universal character stereotypes. When it comes to character development, Hunter x Hunter is second to none. All characters are virtually unique, and its almost impossible to hate any of them.
The four main characters, Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio, are at first pulled together in the beginning of the anime for one reason: to become Hunters. But they all do this for their own means, and are never all together for any long period of time. Although people argue that the two main characters are essentially Gon and Killua, there are almost whole arcs at times where they are not the center focus. And the dismemberment of the group can be agitating at times, not knowing when you'll get to see another again.
But the distinctiveness of characters in Hunter x Hunter not only come from the main characters, but also from the villains. Each villain in HxH is well-developed with interesting attributes unique only to them. Never will you see villains quite as good or even remotely like Hisoka, Chrollo, and Meruem. Their characterizations are impressive and original, and are compelling in their own unique ways. They are in no means non-threatening though, as the anime clearly shows how treacherous and merciless they can be.
Altogether, Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a masterpiece. There are potentially no downsides. Although there is a point later in the chimera ant arc that shifts heavily into narration. But this is meant to increase psychological suspense, and allows viewers to read more into certain characters' thoughts and actions. And this adds on to HxH's uniqueness, as it widely differs from typical Shounens who are mainly focused on ""epic fight scenes"" that will last for episodes at a time. HxH does a great job in its fighting aspect, and characters at most times must use strategy rather than brute force to defeat their opponents. While most fights will only last for minutes at a time, the story in HxH makes up for all of it. Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a fantastic anime that sets itself apart from all other anime in its genre. This series definitely deserves the rating it holds, as it will send you on an unpredictable, savoring adventure.

                ""Hunter x Hunter"" is the anime adaption of Yoshihiro Togashi's manga of the same name, and is also a reboot of the original anime adaption from 1999. 
This review will contain very few spoilers, and will not break down the story arcs, rather it will analyse the show as a whole and give my overall opinion of the entire show. 
Story:
Premise:
""Hunter x Hunter"" has a very interesting and well set up premise, that is simple to follow from the the very beginning. The story follows Gon Freecss, a 12 year old kid from Whale Island, who has spent his life becoming one with nature and
                  honing his reflexes and skills, shining in activities such as fishing and things like that. He's an outdoor kid. He has but one goal in mind, to become a ""Hunter"". Despite the name, Hunters are not guys who go around hunting animals, but are elite members of society with great power and influence over the general population, and are a part of the Hunter Association, which are an organised group who regulate Hunters and are a powerful organisation who help maintain the world and its standards.
To become a Hunter, one must prove themselves in the ""Hunter Exam"", a difficult round of tests where only the most elite people can pass. But Gon does not seek glory, or treasure or fame, he seeks one thing. His Father, Ging, who left him on Whale Island as a baby. Ging happens to be a Hunter, and Gon wants to become a Hunter himself so he can seek out his Dad, follow in his footsteps and find out why he chose being a Hunter over raising his own son.
Yes, it sounds like your typical shounen stuff that we've all seen before, but there's many things it has going for it that no other series of the same demographic has.
Pacing:
Despite being a long running anime series that is 148 episodes in length. ""Hunter x Hunter"" is very well paced, especially when one compares it to ""Naruto"", ""Bleach"", ""One Piece"", and ""Fairy Tail"". 
Several people complain that the Chimera Ant Arc is too long, and that the exposition in this arc messes up the pacing to unforgivable levels. I disagree with this statement, and think these people don't fully understand the arc or the genius of its exposition. 
The battles:
An important aspect to mention about ""Hunter x Hunter"" is it's take on the fighting side of things.
""Hunter x Hunter"" is different in the way it executes fights, in the sense that the fights themselves are almost never purely about raw strength, brute force, or who can take out the enemy with the biggest and most powerful nuclear. Instead, the battles are all about strategy, tactics and ingenuity.
For example, the main character Gon isn't all that strong to start with, yet his speed, agility and keen senses give him some edge in battles. He can quickly avoid attacks due to his size and speed, and his senses and adaptability allow him to analyse his opponents and plan some kind of counterattack.
Strategy and smarts are the key here, and everything is so well set up that it works every single time.
The main character, Gon, is unlike many other shounen characters, in that he is not the strongest character. He has huge potential but he is nowhere near being the most powerful. And unlike many shounen anime, ""Hunter x Hunter"" doesn't have the any sudden or illogical power ups at all. All of the hard work and training that characters put in to become stronger or learn new techniques are shown to viewers so there are no spontaneous new moves that seem like they come from nowhere. On top of this, characters are seen winning battles mostly through tactics as opposed to brute force. The Nen system is also very intricate and thought out, and allows for a huge range of powers. And unlike shounens like Naruto (not hating, I actually like Naruto), it's not the person who has the most chakra (Nen) who wins, but rather who utilizes it the best. 
The battles are almost never one sided, if at all, to the point where you can't even be sure who'll win. 
Conclusion:
The series ends perfectly, with more or less everything resolved. The Manga is actually still on-going, and the Anime had to stop due to Togashi being ill and on hiatus, something he does far too often. Despite this, the series ends at a point, where everything wraps up nicely. 
Characters:
What makes ""Hunter x Hunter"" stand out, even more than its amazing plot, is its characters. 
Here are some details:
""I can't stand being on the losing end forever!!""
— Gon Freecss
Gon Freecss: Gon is the main character of ""Hunter x Hunter"", and is typical happy go lucky protagonist who will do anything and everything to achieve his goal of becoming a Hunter and finding his Father. Gon is interesting as far as main character goes, because of how he is. His actions are unpredictable, simply because his personality is unpredictable. Gon does what he wants where he wants.
It may sound simple, and maybe even a little cliche, but Gon is just interesting to watch, and his development is especially something to note. While he begins with a slow start, Gon develops dramatically, from a simple minded kid, with no experience, to a fast learning, powerful and incredibly strong individual. He is determined, stubborn and downright awesome. Gon has the one trait that most Shounen heroes are lacking these days and that is personality. He is unpredictable. He's just such a likeable and believable main character. And don't even get me started on his incredible character development and well handled morality during the Chimera Ant Arc.
""Assassination—It's the family trade. We all take it up. My folks see me as an exceptional prospect. But I don't see that I should have to live up to their expectations.""
— Killua Zoldyck, to Gon Freecss
Killua Zoldyck: Killua is a young 12 year old boy that Gon meets during the Hunter Exam, and despite the mysterious air about him, and an obvious hostile nature, he and Gon become best friends in a flash.
Killua is a member of the famous Zoldyck family, a family of Assassins, and from an early age was exposed to a life of murder, torture and slaughter. Due to this, despite his appearance, and child-like nature, Killua is actually a cold blooded killer, who revels in blood and enjoys slaughter, making him a sharp contrast to Gon. He is very intelligent for his age and is well versed in various assassination techniques and has agility and stamina on the same levels as Gon does.
However, without saying much, Killua is easily the most interesting and well developed character of the series, solely because of his transition from a dark, psychopathic monster, into Gon's best friend and almost blood brother. The development of Killua is simply incredible, as it is not sudden, but is instead a gradual process that happens over time.
Killua is what holds the series together for the most part. He is the most interesting character.
""Sometimes... Silence is the best answer.""
— Kurapika
Kurapika Kurta: Kurapika is another protagonist, and befriends Gon and Leorio as they travel together to the Hunter Exam Site. Kurapika also desires to become a Hunter, in order to gain the power and knowledge to avenge his clan: The Kurta, who were slaughtered by an infamous band of thieves known as The Phantom Troupe, who murdered them for their Scarlet Eyes, which are said to be priceless and beautiful.
Kurapika is all about revenge and vengeance, and although he mostly appears calm and collected, he is quick to anger, and can be fierce when provoked, especially when it involves his clan or the Troupe. when angered, his Scarlet eyes show themselves, and enhance his abilities to their maximum potential.
In terms of development, Kurapika is also well developed. While he starts off as an emotionless, angst guy who simply cares for nothing but vengeance, as the series progresses, he comes to terms with reality, and realizes the people he still has matter more than his revenge. He's my favorite character of all time.
""If I become Chairman... I'm going to make the Hunters Association my private property!""
— Leorio Paradinight, during his speech
Leorio Paradinight: Leorio is the final member of the main protagonists and is more minor than the rest.
He claims he wants to become a Hunter solely for the immense amount of money they can acquire and due to the social status and perks that come from being a Hunter, but in reality he has a noble reason behind what he is doing, and merely puts on this front to avoid talking about it.
Despite having the appearance of a middle aged man, Leorio is actually a teenager of 16, yet he acts on a level of maturity equal to that of his appearance. He is easily the least skilled fighter of the group, and isn't too bright either, but he possesses great stamina, determination and an almost unbreakable will that makes him so likeable. He's a very righteous character, who always looks out for others. He also serves as the comic relief character, and tends to do really stupid shit.
His backstory at this point isn't well explained, and his goal has a ways to go, and therefore Leorio has yet to develop much, but his overall development is still there and is very gradual considering how little screen time he's gotten to himself.
Leorio is easily likeable, and remains an interesting character due to having the role of the ""big brother"" of the group. He keeps everyone together, and it's nice to see.
And don't even get me started on Gon and Killua's friendship, which is by far the most believable and emotion educing friendship ever conceived in the anime medium. 
In regards to the stories villains, they are just as well developed and grounded as the protagonists, from the perverted, sexual deviant, yet cunning and incredibly powerful Hisoka, to the mysterious and ever ominous. Phantom Troupe, the villains are always shadowed in mystery, and are just downright interesting.
The villains are also interesting due to them being more complex than your average Anime villain. While some shows, such as ""Bleach"" and ""Akame Ga Kill"" have villains who are irredeemable and swimming in an endless sea of black morality, the villains of this show are another matter. They are evil yes, but they also show compassion for one another. They treat each other like family, and often act the way they do for reasons other than ""because I can"". The Chimera Ants break this trend later on because they aren't human but the main antagonist of the arc, actually becomes the best written morally grey character of all time.
All in all, after a lengthy explanation. The characters of ""Hunter x Hunter"" are simply perfection. They are all interesting, unique, and well developed.
Art and Animation:
Hunter x Hunter was animated by Madhouse. The production values for this show, especially considering it's a long running anime, are simply incredible.
The art is unique, with each character being uniquely designed, brightly coloured, and detailed as possible. The locations in which the show takes place are also well done, with detailed backgrounds and colourful and vibrant environments. 
The art contains such amazing attention to detail, that everything from the characters to the locations are just beautiful to gaze upon.
The animation itself, is excellently done, with every frame captured beautifully, be it movement, combat, or just plain sitting and talking. Nothing is jumpy or jittery. Nothing is stat-icy or lazy. It's just all perfect.
Madhouse did an amazing job at animating this 2011 ""Hunter x Hunter"" anime as when I looked back into the arcs on manga, Togashi's drop in quality is incredibly noticeable yet we don't see it at all in the anime. Everything is consistently beautiful in ""Hunter x Hunter"". 
Sound:
The music of this show is amazing. I have no issues with it, and find the themes to be fitting, epic and well produced.
The music is very good at setting the mood and the nostalgia hit hard when I heard these songs after the anime had ended. 
Hunter x Hunter's OST offered a sentimental feeling that permeated through most of the series. 
The opening theme is, surprisingly for a long running series, the same one the whole way through and is called ""Departure"". It's catchy, upbeat, and really captures the atmosphere of the series. The lyrics themselves are even symbolic of the series and its complex themes, almost hinting at the series dark undertones. The accompanying opening sequences are always really great too.
The Ending themes are also really great. The first one, ""Just Awake"" is a strange, yet catchy one. I loved it. The second ending, ""Hunting for your dream"" is excellent and is epic as hell. There's just this really amazing feeling when it plays at the end of each episode. Then, there's ""Reason"" which is again, excellent, and has a very calm and soothing feeling to it. 
The voice acting is solid. All the characters are voiced appropriately. Gon sounds like the little kid he should, Hisoka sounds like a sexual deviant with a lust for blood. Everyone sounds perfect.
The sound effects are great. There's lots of banging, clanging, and everything else. They feel real, and they give the impact they should. 
Overall: 10/10 A total masterpiece!",10

                Hunter x Hunter 2011 is amongst the greatest anime I have ever seen. I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone and everyone who reads this review!
 STORY- the story of Hunter x Hunter 2011 is very good because it has amazing fast pacing for the majority of the show without feeling rushed whatsoever. You will feel like you are on a roller coaster ride with the quick progression of the main characters and the twists and turns of the plot! That is why I give the story a 10.
 CHARACTETRS- By the time you finish it, you will think back on the grand journey of Gon,
                  Killua, Kurapica, and Leorio and just be in complete awe at how much they have changed, developed, matured and improved in skill. They change and go through so much together throughout the series that I have no choice but to give the character development a 10.
 SOUND- This category is more up to personal preference, but I can say that in my opinion, Hunter x Hunter 2011 has an overall great soundtrack. I absolutely love the opening and most of the endings. Endings five and six are probably in my top 10 ending songs of all time. The iconic opening is very good and upbeat which gets you excited for the episode. The only downside to the opening is that although the opening is great, they never change it as the series goes on. As well as all these other things, The soundtrack is exceptional. The only reason why I give the sound a 9 is because the opening is the same and the soundtrack is good not perfect. It is very close to the perfection of a 10.
 ART- The art and animation in Hunter x Hunter 2011 is executed very well. The movements are smooth and fluent and the artstyle looks very nice and colorful but can be very dark at other times (ex: Chimera Ant Arc)
 THE RESULT- Overall I give Hunter x Hunter 2011 a 10/10 this anime has truly been amazing, I fully enjoyed every second of it.",10

                I just don't understand. Every time I see people talking about hunterxhunter, or ""hxh"", I only hear positives things. they talk about their two favorites arcs(which btw is york new and chimera ant arc), and the fleshed-out characters, and the well thought of the power system, and so on. While I see a clusterbomb of a series, that spares us no time to throw up. Whenever I say this to my friends, they try to protect their oh so beloved show with stupid excuses. There are  3 main things that the hxh fanbase loves to talk about, and that is, character development, the stupid
                  nen power system, and their 2 favorites arc that they just won't shut up about!! firstly, the character development is too slow and sudden, trash and fake. It's like really bad actors in an average stereotypical movie. Secondly, the nen system is trash and doesn't take its principles seriously. people say that this system is perfect because of how fair and strategy-based it is.  If this were to be true, I would at least be able to understand the hype about this show just a little, but it's not. In the chimera ant arc, We experience the difference of power, between the humans and the royal ants. if the battle system is supposed to be fair and strategy-based, why are the ants so strong? Netero literally said, that one pitou was almost too much for him. If this is true, then how is anyone supposed to beat the Ant king with strategy, if the ant King SERVANT was too much for the STRONGEST human to handle? If the author was going to make such a half-assed power system, he might as well have added some more stuff into the show. Thirdly, the two arcs that everyone is talking about are trash. let me start with the york new arc. you can tell how half-hearted and uncreative this arc is, by just looking at the title of the arc.  It's literally new york but the words are switched. It's actually funny how accurate this describes this arc. The author just wanted to introduce a lot of characters at the same time, so the series didn't look as bland as did before. and oh boy, was that a bad decision. Not only that, but he made Kurapika the main focus in the arc. kurapika is the most uninteresting and bland character, a person has ever created. He is just a bad copy of the already bad character, Sasuke. Now, to the chimera ant arc. this arc is just too long and is filled with the boring narrator talking about some unimportant shit. not only that, I was forced to look at the horrible character development, of this too op character called meruim. And whenever an emotional moment was supposed to happen, everything just became gibberish. So the overall rating is trash, and this show is overrated.",3
"
                After hearing how great and perfect of an anime this was, I was very excited to watch it and join the ELITE club of those who had the PRIVELAGE of watching HxH.
DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE.
This was false advertising. I never wanted to stop watching an anime so much. It was literally so boring and felt like filler episodes the whole time. I forced myself to keep watching this horrible story because I wanted to get to the ""good part"" that put this anime at such a prestigious title among all other shonen... It never appeared.
This was absolutely the most overhyped anime ever, and it
                  was horrible. You couldn't pay me enough to watch this show.
The characters were superficial; there was no depth in any of them. The arcs were supposed to be amazing but each one didn't even connect with each other. At one point, the anime turned into a card game to ""catch them all"". These arcs, the building blocks; THE FOUNDATION of an anime story; just felt so random and very filler-like.
Here are some problems I had with it:
They didn't push the main story.
There was no real in-depth character development throughout the series.
- This was especially annoying when we were supposed to understand the weight of specific moments in the show about characters in which we knew NOTHING about, except the fact that they had less than 20 minutes of combined screen time???
After each arc, the characters basically disappeared from the story (Kurapika??? Phantom Troupe???)
The fights were not great at all in this show.
And the most annoying thing, the arcs were HORRIBLE.
- Hunter Exam arc: 99 cent store Chunin exams but ON SALE without anything exciting. First, they walked for a few episodes, and then they ran for a few episodes. After, they cooked. Then they play mini games. Lastly, they play a game of hide and seek with no interesting encounters.
- Zoldyck Family arc: They went to Killua's house to pick him up.
- Heaven's Arena arc: Just trained and barely even covered the actual heaven's arena tournament.
- Yorknew City arc: Cool ""bad guy group"" was on the loose. They had some cool interactions. Kurapika, someone we were supposed to feel bad for, had some cool screen time. However, in an arc where background, character development, and an in-depth understanding of Kurapika is crucial, it was lack luster because we never learned anything about him. The Phantom Troupe was a cool idea, but they just disappear after this. They don't have any depth to them. They're supposed to be super powerful but never really do anything. Overall, this was the best arc in the anime, but it was below average (AT BEST) in general. If you didn't find this arc interesting, you definitely won't like anything else here-on-out about this anime.
Greed Island arc: Worst arc in the anime. The characters move to a new area where they really just collect cards. How is this interesting at all? No connection to a story. They jump in a PC, collect cards, and then jump out.
Chimera Ant arc: Overhyped and super random. It starts out with no context and just a sudden problem for some reason. The main bad guys (chimera ants) were super random and just became a problem in the story for no reason at all. There was a super important connection the audience was supposed to feel but the main character, Gon, literally just met these characters; how are we supposed to fall in love with characters we barely know? The pacing was horrible. There was like 4 episodes for 4 steps at one point. The main bad guy (the king guy) looked promising but played checkers the whole time. Very boring fights. (Spoiler maybe?? Doesn't matter, don't watch this anime) Gon has his big moment with a generic power-up that literally looked HORRIBLE. He was supposed to be feeling super angry with intense feelings of darkness, revenge, and PURE RAGE of violence and betrayal.... and all he did was grow a few of feet and grew his hair out. If pure rage, hatred, DESTRUCTION, is supposed to look like Gon on this power up, then we have to move away from random evil power ups in the industry. In the end, there was no point of this arc. Just super random and very superficial.
Hunter Chairman Election arc: The arc really just covered some rigged voting system.
In a story where it's about Gon trying to find his dad, he barely gets any clues at all; just at the end of the show (last arc) for the most part. There was no flow at all to the story. It seemed like 6 filler arcs put together to make the ""best shonen anime ever"". I really have nothing good to say about this anime. It never got really good; I sort of just pushed through because of the hype that just led to disappointment. It was the most boring thing I've ever watched. Watching paint dry would be more interesting than watching HxH because at least the paint would dry quicker, and you would be done within a few hours.
Basically, this 9+/10 rating is not doing the actual show justice. If anything, it's lucky to get a 4/10. I do not recommend watching this show.",3
"
                Okay, I've watched this a while back and I see very positive reviews over this show and I'm not gonna lie, it is suprising. I see this show as a wasted potential. This show makes me really sad for the wrong reasons.
Story: It's fine, not the best. Everything starts off with our main character Gon wanting to be a hunter to find and be like his father (which he never met). He meets with our other main characters at the contest. Gon, never had any trainings for this before but he accomplishes to win like other people that has a backstory of assassination, or like
                  very dangerious and strong characters. This is an issue on it's own. Gon and Killua are together the most of the show and we see them getting strong without doing anything. They get training and magically, they get strong like they don't even try. This part pissed me off. (SPOILER) And one of the worst things for me; the villain characters just too powerful, they dont get powerful or they don'T do anything to get powerful. They're just born that way. Villains do crazy tricks and they have many unique abilities but how they know how to do all those tricks if they never tried them. And an the very ends, Gon gets pissed off of Kites death and killes Pitou but... Why he got so mad, he only met him a month ago and he died a week later when you met him. How he became your breaking point. I just don't understand.
Art: There is not much to say about the art, I liked the art, it's ok. It's better than the old version at least. I like Hisoka's and Killua's character design. I hate Kurapika's costume even tho I really liked the chain part. I think they could make his eyes outshine a bit more. And I just hate Gon's costume as well. I'm not forgetting the fact that it's a bit old show but it's not that old too.
Sound: I like the voice actors acting. The voices are mostly unique and I really like Killua's actors performance. Really, there is not much to say for this one too other than ""it's good"".
Character; Oh boy, did they made me mad? Yes, I was pissed when I finished the show. Characters start of really good with the way show describing them. But they did a really bad job at character growth and they wasted the characters. I'm having a hard time explaining how they wasted the characters but when I compare this to other animes I just feel like how they couldn't or how they didn't even tried to make our characters look hardworking for their appriciated power, they just , can do the things they do. We never get to see how? And they don't look smart too, the show just tells us that they are smart or genious exc. Like Hisoka, very very good villain, interesting and unique but, why and how exactly? My favorite characters are Killua and Hisoka just bc they were good thru all these issues.
Enjoyment: At the end of it, being so pissed off about how they couldn't make the show good while they easily could with small differences, I came to a point to think that it's kind of a show that you should watch but shouldn't get too overcritical over it. Just watch it, don't think too much. It's fun, it's ok. Some episodes and some characters really makes you feel something too. 
Overall: I am sad and mad about the show, I said it when I finished it and I'll say it again. Overall, I'd say watch it, but don't expect much like I did before watching it. Don't listen to hardcore fans, they would say it's flawless. Obviously it's not flawless. I think it worths watching.",6
"
                Hunter x Hunter is so horrifically bad that I actually thought that the 9 star rating was some type of sick anime community joke. This is coming from someone who has a 9 above average rating of all animes I've watched. I've left my first review to save even one person from watching this downright terrible show. 
Reasoning:
1. MC sucks. Just a stubborn, one-dimensional kid.
2. Pacing sucks. Half of every episode is repeated dialogue. You can skim through every episode and still pick up the general idea. Most long animes are because of filler, which you have the option to skip. This anime is long
                  because the episode time distribution is terrible.
3. You have to wait for the 3rd arc, around 37 episodes for things to become interesting.
4. It doesn't matter if it's interesting, because everything in this show is anti-climactic. They build up villains for no absolute reason. You have to wait dozens of episodes of buildup for a fight that lasts less than 5 minutes.
5. You think that its going to be an adventure with friends? Nope, main characters dissapear for arcs. 
6. The supposed ""best arc in the anime history"" is over 100 episodes in. 
7. Overhyped main villain.
This anime is like an expensive dish you bought that tastes terrible. Even though it's terrible, you committed too much into it that you feel like you have to finish it. You then tell yourself that the dish you ordered was good, in denial that you wasted so much on it. That is basically how Hunter x Hunter ended up with a 9 star rating.",1
"
                This review includes spoilers, so read at your own risk.
If one were to ask what a perfect shonen anime looks like, Hunter x Hunter might be the closest they would ever find. It is the pinnacle of story elements fused with artistic elements to tell a narrative.
Story: The story starts off fairly simple, a boy wants to become a Hunter by completing a rigorous exam to find his father. However, on the way, he encounters a variety of detours and blocks that he must overcome should he ever want to complete his goal. Togashi perfectly weaves these together so that   the story is
                  relevant but doesn't seem too focused to the point where variety is lost. Examples would be the Zoldyck and Yorknew City arcs where the ex-assassin Killua and revenge-driven Kurapika respectively are the concentrations in the arc, and Gon must play his part in their stories, as they play in his own. Another part of Hunter x Hunter that is clever is the way each arc is connected to the previous and next. At times, an story takes a ""random adventures"" approach where the characters go on random adventures which may become irrelevant to the overall story unless they foreshadow something, and hinder plot progression. However, Hunter x Hunter doesn't waste time doing this; instead, each arc is relevant to the story and without it, the story is crippled. Something else that Hunter x Hunter does quite unconventionally is the change in power levels. Generally, as the plot progresses, the strength of characters increase in ascending order. In Hunter x Hunter, the power levels fluctuate as the plot goes on, meaning that even though all the antagonists are generally stronger than Gon is, the levels go something like ""overwhelmingly strong to strong to god strong"" rather than just ""strong, overwhelmingly strong, god strong."" The battles are unique in Hunter x Hunter; they use a lot of strategy, tactics, and mental power rather than brute force and raw skills. Even a character in the series notes that technique overshadows raw power. When it comes to themes, Hunter x Hunter perfectly emphasizes them without being to explicit until the very end. An example would be the Chimera Ant arc, where the central theme was that humanity was the greatest monster of all. It was subtly pointed to throughout the arc, as the Chimera Ants were corrupted by their human genes, and at the end, it was more explicit, when Netero used the Rose and it is even stated itself. The anime ended on a note that was appropriate and settled the story.
Art: The art is flawless in the Hunter x Hunter 2011 anime. Characters are drawn in proportion and detailed; unlike its manga counterpart at times. The backgrounds are amazing and the objects are placed accurately within the space. What is most intriguing is that the colours are generally bright which gives the series a happy-go-lucky feel to it at first, but then as the story goes on, the atmosphere becomes darker, but the colours generally remain the same, but it doesn't distract the viewer from the emotions evoked by the story, which is difficult to accomplish, but Madhouse pulled it off.
Sound: The soundtrack in Hunter x Hunter is amazing. To begin, there is such a variety of soundtracks that evoke each mood in the anime from happiness to sadness to fear to suspense. The soundtrack does not have a constant mood throughout the pieces, but rather the moods change as the settings change, and eventually, as the characters change. The OP is the same throughout the series, which can get repetitive, but the lyrics are altered for the sequence of arcs. This is made up for, however, by the EDs, which are catchy and generally represent the themes of the arcs in which they are played. The voice actors are appropriate for each character, and they really stand out at times when they need to, like Knov's mental breakdown and Gon's outrage. 
Character: The characters in Hunter x Hunter are phenomenal and are what give the story its essence. To begin, there is a variety of characters from the happy-go-lucky Gon to the vengeful Kurapika. It helps the show avoid being repetitive and predictable. What is interesting in Hunter x Hunter is the dimension that is being added to these characters, and this helps them avoid looking cliche and purely archetypal. Kurapika, despite being revenge-driven cares deeply for his friends and doesn't want to involve them in his dangerous, personal mission. He acts as a voice of reason and rationality in the group, preventing conflicts from escalating. At the same time, whenever he is around the Phantom Troupe, it is up to the other characters to be a voice of reason and rationality, to prevent HIM from escalating conflicts. Another person would be Hisoka. Hisoka, the whimsical magician, has an odd pleasure for Gon and fantasizes about killing him, but strangely enough, he comes to help Gon out whenever he most needs it. In terms of character development, Hunter x Hunter takes the cake. This was most prominent in the Chimera Ant arc. The central antagonist, Meruem, starts off as a violent character, believing that the world belongs to him and himself only, and that he is the epitome of strength. However, after meeting a blind girl named Komugi who can outsmart him, he ponders on the true meaning of strength and his own identity. It goes to the point that at the climactic battle of the arc with him and Netero, he tries to reason things out whereas Netero demands a fight. Komugi on the other hand, goes from overly humble and self-deprecating, to confident and self-valuing. Gon himself takes a change from cheerful and naive about pain to being unable to contain it himself.
Overall, I have enjoyed this series for the reasons stated above, and it's a shame it cannot be continued due to the tendencies of the manga. It is near-perfect.",10
"
                IDK how this series didn't receive more attention!!! Despite the anime's seemingly childish appearance and its young cast of characters, DO NOT BE DECEIVED, for Hunter x Hunter is one of the greatest shounen anime series I've ever seen. As with most animes in the shounen genre, Hunter x Hunter is centered on the  theme of the main protagonist overcoming challenges and obtaining god-like abilities and strength to fulfill his/her ultimate dream. But that's as cliche as Hunter x Hunter gets.  It has an unpredictable and interesting cast of characters, some of which are my all-time favorites, because most of them are not
                  what they seem to be. For instance, Hisoka is one of the most unorthodox and fascinating--but not really evil--antagonist you'll ever see. Although at times the main character, Gon, does come off as overly optimistic, unlike other notorious shonen characters (including Naruto & Ichigo Kurosaki) Gon actually achieves maturity and develops a real depth in character. Also, to top it off the anime only has 2 (YES ONLY TWO) filler/re-cap episodes!!! In conclusion, Hunter x Hunter is definitely a breath of fresh air and not for one moment of the 148 episodes was I not entertained. I highly recommend Hunter x Hunter to all anime and manga lovers!!!",8
"
                Hunter X Hunter is a overhyped piece of dogshit. At first it seems really promising and fun but after that it becomes so damn tedious and boring. ALSO spoilers, so be warned. It starts off with a cool and neat exam that I enjoyed watching and then it went onto this building arc where they fought a bunch of people including Hisoka for money or something. Then a whole new cast of characters are just brought onto the series and things goes nuts. A cast of a bunch of loser misfits and 2 likeable characters become evil and try to sabotage some shit. But basically
                  2 groups meet up incidentally a huge battle happens. The good guys win, yahoo. After that Gon get's sucked into a video game his father had left a memory card for. This arc was seriously really cool to me and I actually really enjoyed it! But it's villain fucking sucked so much and was annoying to listen to. He wasn't 'so evil you hated him' but instead was irritating to have as a villain, you didn't know anything about him and he's apparently just blowing everybody up now. Next up is the biggest waste of fucking time in any anime that I've ever seen and I know a lot of other people would agree with me on this. 61 episodes of boring nonsense, about 40 of them being filled with literally nothing and characters being developed for no god damn reason. Stupid animal characters are given episodes and episodes of character development and it adds literally NOTHING to help the story out. I do not care about these characters whatsoever. I honestly wouldn't have been surprised if the author developed a whole character out of a spec of dust. Finally the part people actually care about comes along, the Pitou fight. This fight was seriously cool as hell. It was so so insane and I loved it, and the Gon nen skip thing was badass af. Also the Killua and Netero fights were sweet as well. But it was not worth watching like 120 episodes or something just to get to these fights. I could just go watch them on Youtube if I wanted. ""B-But character development, you wouldn't be able to understand the fights!"" Yeah, I don't think it's really needed all too much here. You could just watch these fights without having gone through these 100+ episodes and still get what's going on, everybody knows who Gon is and what he's like. Also this story will most likely never be completed because the author just couldn't be bothered to finish it off after Gon found his father and wanted to add even more. Along with that, multiple people have told me that you have to/should watch video essays or read things explaining the events to really understand stuff, that's stupid. You shouldn't have to watch a 30 minute video explaining some event in a 148 episode anime, all of this stuff should be explained to you in the show. I even watched some of the original anime and even read a few volumes of the manga and still did not really like this series at all. I seriously seriously wanted to enjoy this show but I just couldn't...",4

                Starting off as a manga released by Yoshihiro Togashi in 1998, Hunter x Hunter got an anime adaptation in 1999, but it was cut short in the middle of an arc due to Togashi's many hiatuses (UGH). It was followed up with three OVAs to cover the rest of the arc that wasn't animated, as well as the arc afterwards. 
But in 2011, Madhouse decided to remake the series, following the example set by FMA: Brotherhood. And Madhouse definitely delivered.
Story: There are 7 arcs in total, with the longest arc being about 60 episodes, and the shortest being about 10. The arcs link up almost
                  seamlessly, with a clear beginning and ending of each arc.
The filler is almost nonexistent, with only 2 recap episodes early on. It's easy to see why; the source material was over a decade old by the time Madhouse got to it. But it's good to know that you're missing almost nothing by not reading the manga.
Yes, the show does have a bit of a slow start, and the later episodes can be almost DBZ levels of slow. But power through these flaws, and you won't regret it.
Art: Long running shounen anime have a bad rep of not having the best quality animation, and you can understand why. You're bound to let a few errors through when you have to animate more than 100 episodes on a weekly schedule.
But HxH does not fall into this trap. The art and animation quality never slip, and at several points I was amazed at the quality of animation, especially during the fight scenes.
Sound: Yes, the same opening song is used for all 148 episodes of the series (as two versions of the same song being alternated by arc), but it's such a good song that I never skipped past it during my watching of the series.
The endings do change, though, and they are worth sitting through. I'm the type of guy that goes to the next episode as soon as the ending credits hit, no matter the show. But HxH was an exception. I still listen to the ending songs regularly, even after I've finished watching the series.
As for the music in the actual episode, it's not as memorable as the opening and ending, but it does a good job of getting you hyped for what's gonna happen next.
And the voice acting is FANTASTIC. If I had to imagine what each character would sound like if I had not heard their voice, I would imagine it would sound like these voices.
Characters: All the characters are memorable. Whether it be the main characters or some person that showed up for a few episodes and was never mentioned again (such as Zepile), everyone gets plenty of development, which makes what happens in the later arcs matter that much more to you.
Gon starts out as the traditional physically gifted, but mentally not as gifted, shounen protagonist. As the series progresses, he makes some strides in his abilities, to the point where he can do some genuinely genius stuff during his fights with the villains.
Killua starts out as a cold assassin, but Gon and the gang warms him up, and later on he supplies some of the best comedic moments of the series, even when the series is at its darkest point. But even though he gains a comedic side, he doesn't sacrifice any of his fighting capabilities.
Kurapika has one goal and one goal only; to kill the thieves that murdered his clan. Kurapika gets his own arc to accomplish his goal, and its one of the best arcs in the entire series. Sadly, Kurapika mostly disappears after the arc is over.
Leorio is clearly the weak link of the group, being easily fooled into traps and being the weakest in terms of both physical strength and Nen capabilities. But he eventually becomes something of a father figure to Gon and Killua before disappearing, never to be seen again.
Enjoyment: After finishing the series, I began consuming everything HxH, but in the back of my mind, I realize nothing will equal this series unless they do a second remake that's somehow better than this.
You will laugh, you will cry (oh you WILL cry), and once you're done, you will want to watch it again as soon as the last episode ends.
Final thoughts:
Yes, it falls victim to some typical shounen tropes. Yes, it can get on the slow side, especially near the end. Yes, it ends on a psuedo-cliffhanger that will probably not be resolved in the manga until the year 3000. But the positives of the series are so good that you almost totally forget about the negatives.",10

                Hunter x Hunter was an absolutely amazing anime, I personally loved everything about it! Besides the opening was always either departure or departure ver.2 Which I didn't mind, but personally would've preferred more sound variety? (not included the endings)
The reason as to why I loved this anime so much would have to be the gripping story line and the characters, Hunter x Hunter just had you wanting to watch more! That's what I love about this anime it had me so engrossed from the very first arc! On the other hand, I could hardly find any faults in Hunter x Hunter, leading to such a
                  perfect rating (excluding the music) 
Thankyou for reading my review!",10

                This could be the best thing I have ever seen. I was having doubts at the beginnig of the series thinking it was childish but I was blown away. HunterxHunter is an amazing work of imagination. There are all kinds of character so you never get bored. They dynamics changes with every arc so its never repetetive. Is ıt a typical shonen ?Yes .Is ıt awesome ?Yes. My favourite arc being the chimera ant arc, I have never experienced this many feelings within one arc. With the epic soundtrack combined ,it is just one enjoyable anime. I hope it continues one day. If you didn't
                  watch it ,JUST DO IT. JUST DO IT !!",10
"
                The only part I didn't like about the story was how they babied fans by explaining every detail piece by piece in the Chimera Ant arc, they took too long showing a battle that lasted half an hour over several episodes. That just killed my thirst for action. But that was my only main complaint. Overall it was great to watch and rewatch again.
The art style of the anime stays true to what the manga appears to be, the animators didn't get lazy by reusing certain frames because of the dialogue, I didn't see any frame repeats except for maybe Gon's iconic move.
The sound/music was
                  okay, they got really lazy with openings and kept it to one song with all it's seasons which was a disappointment, I love the endings a lot more. The music in the series seems iconic now because it's well timed in certain events of the story and the sound effects are well done and timed.
The push for the story at the beginning seems natural to me, it didn't seem pushed and forced uncomfortably, but as the series progressed the push kinda seems to wear off and I would seem more interested on the expansion into the current plot at hand. Though it still does drag my interest.
The character design is diverse, but! Gon seems like Naruto, being not the sharpest tool in the shed, exceptional stamina and never giving up on friends. Kurapika seeks to be an avenger, kinda sounds like Sasuke. Anyways what I'm trying to point out is, these Shonen Jump series seem too similar in character design and character design isn't what we look forward to in these series. The character powers, side characters and diversity of them makes up for the somewhat cookie cutter main characters.
All I wished is the author of the series to continue the anime like he did with the manga, but it seems to have ended with 148.",8
"
                Hunter x Hunter is the best shounen to date''.
People commonly praise Hunter x Hunter as the best shounen ever created. I can't really say much about this because i've not watched many of the big shounen's. However, I can say that Hunter x Hunter is a solid shounen with a lot of good stuff to offer. It does remarkably well on it's characters and managed to create an interesting and engaging story, but not without flaws.
When I think of Hunter x Hunter the first thing that comes to mind is how masterfully it develops it's side characters. While the main characters get significant amounts of
                  character development the show truly shines at creating side characters and making you feel sympathetic with them, villainous or not. While not every single character is being used throughout the entire show, when they are relevant the show makes sure to tell us everything there is about them and makes sure not to leave them in the dust or use them for plot convenience... except for a few.
One of the things Hunter x Hunter suffers from is using characters for plot convenience. Multiple times throughout the show are we introduced to characters who are solely there to make our protagonists, named Gon and Killua, stronger. There is extensive amounts of training done by our protagonists during the show, which is a good thing. It shows us that power is reached by continuous training and not through the ''power of friendship''. The problem however, stems from the fact that we are introduced to characters who only exist to tell Gon and Killua how to get stronger. We barely get to know anything about their motives except for ''I can't bear seeing people with so much untapped potential so I will train you''. I would be fine with this if these characters were actually relevant to the plot outside of making our protagonists stronger but it feels more like an excuse to have these characters train Gon and Killua. After they're done training them we barely ever see these characters again.
Another instance of using characters for plot convenience has to do with foreshadowing. There is no power of friendship. There are however multiple instances of so called ''asspulls'' within the show. Characters who are gravely injured and bordering death who survive because the show randomly introduces plot points without any foreshadowing towards it's supposed existance. We are told at the last second about a special power a character has that makes said person survive. We have no clue's or indication towards these powers which means they were only brought up because the show needed a ''logical'' reason for our characters to survive. In another instance are we introduced to a character from a certain family that even had an arc about themselves who has the power to grant other people's wishes, but under certain conditions! Naturally this is right after one of our major characters is severely wounded. We've had no evidence of this character's existance untill she was necessary. Sure, she wasn't relevant to the plot before but when we were told who the members of the family were they should've mentioned her or anything regarding her existance. Instead she was pulled out of thin air when the show needed her the most. Talk about convenient.
Speaking about being severely wounded. The show is really good at making sure to remind us our protagonists are, in fact, not invincible. Multiple times will we see them lose fights against the same opponent over and over and be severely outclassed. As I mentioned earlier there is no such thing as power of friendship within Hunter x Hunter and every victory by our protagonists is gained either by strategy or just being better. Yes, that's all there is to it. The people who have the most strength, within all it's forms win and that is certainly true for Hunter x Hunter. I should mention that actual fights are scarce except for a couple of arcs/episodes. Hunter x Hunter spends a lot of time on it's characters and the fights we get are varying in quality. I wouldn't say any of them are bad ( except for a certain arc when our characters just learned about new powers and steamroll through every opponent unaware about these powers ) but with the exception of a few they aren't anything to write home about either. 
Throughout the show we are introduced to several villainous groups and the way the show develops them to make you accept them morally is incredibly well done. Multiple times have I felt true regret and sympathy towards the villains. This is especially evident in one of the later arcs where the protagonists basically fight for human survival. The show makes us spend a lot of time with the villains and show us what they're like, what they're thinking, what they struggle with and why they do what they do. It shows us that villains can change aswell and as a result we get incredibly good development for most of them. Never before have I truly sympathized with the supposed villains in any show, but the way Hunter x Hunter makes us learn about the villains is truly worthy of praise.
From a technical standpoint the show certainly doesn't fail to deliver.
The art style used works fine for Hunter x Hunter. Backgrounds aren't always exactly the most detailed  but at times when the show focusses on world building the show tries hard and succeeds in showing us what we need to know. The show is certainly capable of good backgrounds and we are shown that plenty of times. Character designs fit the art really well. The backgrounds and character designs show enough similarities that the show looks very natural. Animation is above average throughout the entire show. I haven't witnessed any severe drops in quality and everything was overall very pleasing to look at.
Soundtracks were really good and well done. I added a couple of them to my playlist because they're just that good. The show has fitting soundtracks for most of the situations, however I must say sometimes tracks were used at the wrong times. It didn't take away from the immersion but there were moments I thought to myself ''they should've used this track instead''. 
Think about a lighthearted track during a serious moment or the other way round ( this is slightly exaggerated to get the point across ). 
I don't pay much attention to sound effects but I will notice when a sound effect is really out of place. Gladly I didn't find anything out of the ordinary.
Hunter x Hunter is certainly an incredibly good show worth watching for anyone. It's commonly said to power through the first arc and I agree on this. While I consider the first arc to be fine and actually a load of fun it is a little generic. Consider it the introduction of the characters and plot. The true Hunter x Hunter starts after this. I promise you will not be disappointed.",9
"
                Honestly, I have never enjoyed an anime as much as I have enjoyed Hunter x Hunter. Nor have I binged on an anime to the point that I could finish it in a mere weekend. Hunter x Hunter had played a huge role in my childhood, and I rewatched it again. Even knowing what would happen, the strong impact it had on me from I was a child is still the same.
The story behind Hunter x Hunter is amazing. There are many arcs which shows the blossoming of the different friendships that acquires. The main goal of the main protagonist Gon was to find his
                  dad Ging, but he ended up having to go through several obstacles in order to reach that goal. That itself was the message behind the story. It was what Ging was trying to inform his son. ""You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest because you'll find the things more important than you want"" -Ging Freecss. Gon's main goal was to find his dad, but he ended up making a lot of new friends before he could do that. Those were the detours in his life, and they were absolutely worth it. I've never seen Gon so happy.
The art is flawless. Every detail is drawn so nicely, and the characters have good style. The voice actors did a good job in portraying their emotions. I remember the times in which some characters were so upset to the point that they were crying, and it wasn't the art that convinced me that they were upset. It was the ability of the voice actors to act that out. They really fit their roles very well, and the characters are absolutely adorable. Each and every one of them have their own unique personality, spicing up the stories. 
Hunter x Hunter is definitely something I would recommend. It's worth it. I have no complains, to be honest.",10
"
                It's really hard to call something perfect. Everything has it's flaws, and in the end it depends on your decision to overlook them or to glare at them and refuse to acknowledge that it's pretty close to a masterpiece. But screw all that, because you can count the flaws in this anime on the fingers on one hand. And that's damn impressive considering that this show is a shonen and has 148 episodes. 
Story: 10
If you read the synopsis, you should quickly forget about it. The story is way more than just a fun little adventure series. It goes deeper and deeper with every key
                  event, every arc, and in the end you don't even know what to think anymore. It has so many life lessons, that are so amazingly portrayed that you might be left wondering about your entire existence. You just have to give it a few episodes before it gets there, and while it's not there everything else should keep you well entertained, including some great comedy here and there. Not to mention that every single arc could be it's own anime, but they are all very wisely connected. And the ending, which is incredibly important for a good shonen, is great as well.
Animation: 9
It holds strong. Considering the length of the show, the animation is so amazingly consistent, never failing to deliver. I personally have some issues with a few character designs, but overall everything looks great. From the sea and the grass to the treetops and the sky everything is handled with so much care that it's simply astonishing.
Music: 10
One of the best anime soundtracks out there. It always knows how it wants you to feel and portrays it through the amazing music. It ranges from happy and uplifting, to straight up disturbing and creepy. Also worth mentioning is the opening, showcasing the feeling of adventure, which is really strong in this anime, and unforgettable endings, which showcase individual arcs. Overall incredibly memorable and towards the end you will find youself smiling when you hear certain themes.
Characters: 10
Easily the best part of the show. It doesn't matter if the character is good or evil. You either love to love them or love to hate them. With one exception of course (*cough* Illumi *cough*). However they are so brilliantly written, that they will be stuck in your memory for a good while. The character development is also incredible. Every lesson given to the main heroes stays with them and makes them stronger. No one just becomes an undefeatable god, everyone has to train their ass out to become good, or have some special talent, and even then they all have hidden weaknesses that can be exploited. You will find yourself uncertain about the outcome of each duel, because here it's not who is stronger, it's all about who is faster to find opponents weak spots without giving theirs away. 
Enjoyement: 10
Considering how good this anime is, this could be nothing else but a 10. I didn't regret a single moment spent with Gon and his friends. It always kept me going, wanting more and more, but at the finish line i was satisfied. I felt happy when i saw the finale, because this anime was a hell of a journey, that won't be forgotten any time soon.
Overall: 10
I know that the lenght of the show might scare you, but I really can't reccomend it enough. It will eat your time away like almost nothing else. 
The struggles, the battles, the emotions and the unforgettable characters will most likely leave you thinking about them 24/7 during your watch breaks. Of course this is purely my opinion, and you should always develop your own, but I genuinely believe that this may be as close to a masterpiece as a show can get, considering the length/quality. Truly a 10/10. Would watch again.",10
"
                And the trip goes on .. was the feeling that i had when I finished this series. An impressive journey actually, through the unknown world of Hunter x Hunter with a big revelation in the end that just makes us want another season of it. 
148 episodes of ? Fun, epicness, some drama and also some gay moments (like really weird moments) 
Hunter x Hunter is a story that follows a young 12 years old kid named Gon who is looking for his father and for finding him he has to become a ""Hunter"" and start a journey around the world looking for him. Boring?
                  Crappy plot? Well is everything except that. 
When i heard that Hunter x Hunter looks like One Piece (the general setup is really similar, both start a journey to reach their dreams) i got scared, i was thinking that it was another over rated anime with nothing new to show .. how wrong i was .. 
Story: 8/10. In one hand, the story is really engaging.. in the other hand, the execution of the inicial setup of each arc really makes us wonder how good it actually is.. I mean that each arc ends in a strange way. ""That's it?"" Was the question that I always had in the end of each arc. There are 6 arcs.  
Another tiny problem, is how this anime looks like other animes that i've seen. The setup looks like One Piece, and the special powers and everything related looks like Naruto. The thing is, both are better than Hunter x Hunter on doing it. But while both Naruto and One Piece are just too big and get boring, here such thing doesn´t happen. 
The pace of Hunter x Hunter is what really suprised me. For a shonen, it kinda moves really fast. The fights don´t take more than a couple of minutes (excluding the last arc, where the entire fight takes several episodes). There are no flashbacks, no fillers, there is no development on the evil guys what so ever, so the anime moves much faster than most of the shonens out there. 
The last thing i have to say, this anime has a lot of tiny plot fails that i just can´t forget. In some way, it seemed that the author forgot some parts of it's own story.. but well those are rare and meaningless. 
Art: 8/10. Well .. i wish it was better. The detail on the background for the most part is weak or non-existant. Only few landscapes are awesome. The rest is pretty baddy. The character desigh is not outstanding as well. So why the 8/10? 
IT HAS ONE OF THE BEST FACIAL EXRPESSIONS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. 
We can actually imagine the situation by looking at their faces. Really impressive. The best point is when they are presenting feelings like rage or fear, it just looks awesome. 
And then ... there is one face that i will never forget. Towards the end .. just .. WOW. I can even say the entire episode sucked compared with that last moment (and the episode is actually one of the best episodes here). 
Sound: 8/10. There is one problem. The soundtrack is always the same. For 148 episodes .. it gets boring hearing that. The only part when they change a bit the tracks used, is ont he 5th arc (the best one) but still way too repetitive. 
What really makes up for it, is the opening(which is always the same as well) but it is just way too good for it's purpose. 
Character: 9/10. Well, this is odd. In terms of developemt, there is not much of it. But .. they characters are really likeable. we have a huge cast so we have a huge variety of characters. Feel free to pick one because i'm sure you will find one that you will like. 
About our main characters, Gon, Killua, Kurapika, Leorio. While Gon and Killua have their place in every single arc, Kurapika and Leorio seemed like they were there for nothing. 
There are some arcs where they don´t even appear. I can say, Gon is the main character, Killua the second main chracter(less important than Gon) and Kurapika and Leorio act like secondary characters. I didn´t liked that. I wanted more of them, especially from Kurapika. He has a entire arc for himelf, but still is not enough. 
Enjoyment: 9/10. Well.. for a long time i didn´t saw 10 episode each day for a weak .. the anime starts slowly, but once it gets good, is good until the end. The arc that i disliked more and probably is the worst one, is the 4th arc.. 
There are some memorable moments, I laugh, I almost cried.. this anime as it. A combination of pure action, some drama (only in the 5th arc but it was good as hell), epicness.. there is everything here. 
Another great point, is the relation between Killua and Gon. Being a shonen often means themes like friendship. Here we can actually see a slow evolution of their relation as friends and really pays off in the end. I felt that i learned something about friendship with this anime .. which is rare because most of the anime out there, when they talk about friendship, is always clichê stuff.. 
For last, the feeling of adventure is present in every arc and it really felt good. I personally loved it. ""Fight for your dreams, and you will see that in the process you will find what really matters"" was the sentence that i liked more.. 
Overall: 9/10. I reccomend it. It has my seal of approval. Don´t get scared with the 148 episodes,.. because they are 148 episodes of pure fun.",9

                *MINOR Spoiler in ""Enjoyment""*
Where do I even begin? Hunter X Hunter is by far one of the best animes I've seen to date. Everything from the plot to the characters was great. I don't think I was ever bored, except for those random fillers that recapped everything, which I gladly skipped. 
Story: 10/10
The reason this anime has received such praise is because the story is not only good, but it's told in the best way possible. From beginning to end, I was genuinely excited and craved more. The logic used in this anime is simply superb, and the bits of comedy is a nice break
                  from the drama that occurs. There aren't many fillers, which I appreciated. Instead of wasting an entire episode, they add comic relief sometimes, and it's never overdone. 
Art: 10/10
The animation is excellent, as is the art style. Nothing much more to say here.
Sound: 9/10
The sound is also great. Expect a great opening and endings, as well as good battle music.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Obviously, I enjoyed this anime a lot. The characters are all noteworthy, and their development is amazing. Many animes make the mistake of not providing enough room for development. Hunter X Hunter does not do that at all. It even has you feeling for the secondary characters (still crying about meruem & komugi tbh). 
Overall: 10/10",10

                Are you tired of shounen anime that insult your intelligence by reiterating and dumbing down even the simplest to grasp concepts? Are you tired of anime that want to shove the MC's worldview down your throat as the only and most righteous one? Do you want to watch something that lets you choose what to think instead of making that choice for you? Something that shows both sides of the argument, as well as their respective strengths and weaknesses? Do you dislike the way shounen anime use the 'good/evil' dichotomy to separate the main characters from the villains? Do you want to see well-thought-out fights
                  instead of characters shooting laser beams and defeating their opponents solely due to raw power advantage? 
If you answered 'yes' to those questions then Hunter x Hunter 2011 is for you.  
Anyway, it was about time I did a review for HxH 2011, as I watched this anime for the first time 6 years ago and then I rewatched it numerous times ever since. 
Let's start with the story (10/10):
It starts off very simple yet compelling, with 'Gon', the main character, setting off on a journey to find his father whom, in order to become a Hunter, abandoned him. What is a hunter? Why did his father choose that path instead of raising him? Who even is his father? Those are all questions that kickstart Gon's journey. Simple enough, right? Well, as the story progresses and characters are introduced, the story becomes more and more complex, intertwined with other story arcs that relate to the grander story which is Gon looking for his father. 
This brings me to the next point: The arcs in HxH. In this anime, there are no recycled ideas for characters or concepts. Every arc has its own concept, tone and execution, making each arc vastly different yet very well-connected to the previous ones. Another aspect of HxH that you will appreciate if you are tired of the way in which typical shounen are structured is the way in which HxH doesn't shy away from dedicating entire arcs to other characters that are not the protagonist. Indeed, in HxH the world does not revolve around the MC's motivations and each character has their own agenda. Characters that are not Gon are the MCs of their own stories, and we get to see that. More on this in the 'Character' section.
That is not to say that there are no shounen tropes in HxH. For sure, there are, but most of them have their own twists to them. I do not like to use the term 'subversion of expectations' as it has mostly become a meme with negative connotations due to some terrible executions of it (I'm looking at you Game of Thrones S8), but many elements of HxH's story would fit that term rather nicely. 
Another important aspect which I couldn't help to include in this 'story' section is the power system of HxH as it is an integral part of the story. I do not want to go into much detail about it since much of it might be considered spoilers, but in this anime the power system is not your typical 'rock-paper-scissors' type of system. For example, there is not going to be an element that defeats another ones, such as 'water>fire'. Instead, this system fleshes out the fights to an extent that makes it so strategy, adaptability and planning are all more important than raw power or 'type advantage'. 
Art (10/10):
In this section I will also include animation. Both the art and animation are outstanding in this show given the length of 148 episodes. There is not a single episode, at least that I can remember off the top of my head, that you can say 'that was badly animated/looked terrible'. In fact, the animation and art style seemed to actually improve as the story progressed. This, in my opinion, is quite impressive, given how many seasonal anime can't even achieve a consistent level of animation and direction being 12 to 26 episodes long. 
Sound (9/10):
The sound effects are also incredibly well done in HxH. For example, when a character punches another one you can feel it viscerally. As for the music, the OST is memorable and fitting. It has tracks that fit every facet of the anime very nicely. When the scene requires fast-paced, action music, it is provided. When it requires more somber and serious music, it is provided. When adventurous music would fit the scene better, it is provided. When it is deemed that silence will give a more tense atmosphere, silence is provided. All in all, HxH is an anime that knows when and how to use its tracks. The OST is also very varied. Depending on the track, you have choir, guitar, piano, violin and other instruments being used. There are also a number of tracks that are used only once or twice throughout the whole anime in very specific/impactful moments in order to give those scenes more impact and a sense of uniqueness. 
Then we have the OPs and EDs. Unfortunately, HxH has only one OP, 'Departure', which changes visuals several times throughout the anime but the song remains the same (except for when they use another part/version of the song). I say unfortunately because, although I love Departure and I think it fits the first arc, I do believe that other arcs could have benefitted from different OPs given their vastly different tones. However, contrary to the OPs, there are 6 EDs and they are all different (except for 5 and 6 which are both different parts of the same song, but with very different visuals) and are also among my favorite EDs of all time, which kind of makes up for the fact that the OPs are all the same song. 
Character (10/10): 
This, in my opinion, is where Hunter x Hunter truly shines. This anime will take its time developing and showing you many sides of a character, delving into their minds and thought processes, fleshing them out incredibily well. This applies to secondary characters too, not only our main cast. 
HxH is also not an anime that relies on shock value very often. If a character is going to get killed off then it is after you have gotten to sympathize with the character. It rarely is the case that a character will be introduded in an episode merely to be killed off at the end of it. If such a scenario happens, then it is for a reason other than pure shock value.
In HxH there is also no wasted dialogue. Pretty much every single line in the anime serves a purpose, be it to build the world, to characterize and develop a character in a meaningful way, to foreshadow or to progress the story in some way. Characters that may seem inconsequential, that you may ask 'What role do they have in this story? Why are we focusing so much on them?' will end up having a great impact in the the story, at times even more so than our main characters. 
Another very important aspect of all the characters in HxH is how they all have their own motivations, ideals and goals, as well as obstacles. You will not see the protagonist convincing other characters to follow him, effectively converting them into drones that only serve the purpose of pushing the protagonist's story forward. Instead, when their interests differ from Gon's, they will often go their own way, because they have a life of their own that goes beyond what the protagonist wants.  
It is also important to mention that in HxH the characters do not exist to promote fights. Characters will often resort to other more logical ways in order to resolve conflicts of interest. They are not brutes that can only resolve a conflict through fighting when other means would be more suitable. Thus, fighting in HxH is not the be-all-and-end-all. The focus is first and foremost on the characters and their interactions. However, when fights do happen it is always for a reason, be it because the environment demands it or because all the other more logical options were exhausted. 
As for the villains in HxH, they are nothing short of great, from the more simplistic ones that are just fun to watch to the more complex ones. Essentially, all that I said about the secondary characters applies to the villains but, of course, to a much deeper degree. You get to see their motivations, growth, emotions and conflicts on a very personal level. They grow through introspection and interactions with other characters and their surroundings. Their goals are often much more personally-driven than just 'world domination' or 'power', making some of them more relatable. Be it to understand their purpose in life or just to have fun, they all are very intriguing. 
Enjoyment (10/10):
As I enjoy anime that take their time to build up characters and story elements while at the same time keeping matters interesting and well paced, the enjoyment I derived from HxH 2011 is definitely a lot. The sheer amount of variety that HxH provides in terms of characters and story, as well as the exciting, clever and well-choreographed fight scenes involving characters we care about will give you a lot to enjoy. 
Even if HxH does not have the quantity of fights that other shounen anime have, it definitely more than makes up for it with the quality of the fights whenever they do happen. 
Overall (10/10):
For all the reasons I mentioned and much more, HxH 2011 is truly an anime that I consider to be one of a kind, and I do not hand out 10/10s lightly. If you are a shounen fan then you absolutely must watch this anime. If you are not a shounen fan I would still say give it a try, as it might surprise you! I myself am not particularly the biggest shounen fan yet to me HxH 2011 is up there with some of the best stories ever, and not only within the realm of anime.",10

                The hype that is created around this anime is all bark and no bite. I don't think this anime is bad, but it sure is disappointing and I won't be writing the good staff about this anime since you can find it on other reviews, So proceed at your own will, The premises of the anime is a boy on his quest to find his dad, is just not appealing at all. The plot gets even worse in the story arcs because each arc starts with a bang but as it progresses the focus keeps shifting from the main motives to stupid things. The whole
                  fighting becomes plotless time and time again. There are some good designs like Hisoka but most of the characters designs are average or below average. The main focus of this anime is character development but it messed this thing up too. 
The decisions of various characters are out of order for their developments. Someone who wants to fight strong guys is running after kids to give him a satisfactory fight. Someone who is trying to save his brother is trying to kill his brother. Someone who wants to overtake whole world spends most of his time playing board games with a blind girl. Someone who says that he is a gangster/mafia boss has no strong people in his ranks in a world where they can be easily available. Someone who wants to take revenge for his clan from a terrorist group leaves most of the group members go on their way and terrorize other people without any thoughts. Also, the concept of being a hunter is vaguely described. The last thing is that every arc is unfinished. There is no world building, challenges is introduce with no/vague description So that some just die doing that incorrectly just for the shock factor, there are nen victims every where in the show yet no one is able to know about that, People are constantly been murdered yet no one acknowledge that people are being killed, it's like saiki k is switching the memory for people in the world every time phantom troupe kills bunch of people. There are a bunch of different places but these places has no interconnected histories or present. For example a nation can be destroyed completely but it has no impact on the adjoining countries There are only few epic music and fights, most of them are mostly boring and have no consequences on the future. There's also a period of few episodes where instead of characters, the narrator kept talking which is the most boring piece of media I've ever watched. The final arc is one the the trashist arc in shonen anime history and ends on an really stupid cliffhanger that makes zero sense. Overall, it was a waste of time. Because the best thing about hunter x hunter is its character development and that aspect has so many flaws in it. I don't recommend it to anyone.

                I don't even know where to begin with this review. I don't think I have enough words to describe or express how much I enjoyed this series, or as to why it is so underlooked by the anime community as a whole. Bearing in mind that I have not seen the original 1999 series, nor do I even want to after this rework as it is utterly amazing. I am also going to start this review with my conclusion...Togashi, please finish Dragon Quest and get back to drawing up weekly Hunter x Hunter again. Please for the love of all that's holy!
Story (10/10):
Considering it's starting
                  point as an underdog story whereby everything goes the main character's way somehow, Hunter x Hunter does its best in showing you why you are completely wrong with that view point. 
The anime takes a sudden turn once all the character and ability backgrounds have been covered. It becomes a very dark and psychological story, surprising viewers with a fair bit of gore and violence. Put it this way, Hunter x Hunter is a shounen alongside that of One Piece, Naruto etc. which are very tame when it comes violence. The former however, adds a fair amount of gore so be prepared to see some limb loss, highly detailed broken bones as well as other things you would not see from a general shounen series. 
For anyone who reads the HxH manga, the anime does it complete justice in bringing it into animated form. There is barely any filler (much like FMA Brotherhood). As well as this, the entire ability/power basis in HxH is probably the best explained out of any combat anime, whereby tactics are explained fully, leaving no room for viewers to question how anything actually happened, especially regarding character's ability levels. I was even more impressed at how this was put across in animated form. 
Art (10/10):
The art style used in HxH suits the anime perfectly. Although you will question why some character aura's are the colour they are, but this is mainly due to colour connotation effects, not any actual problem revolving around the art used. I absolutely love the art style and have nothing more to say on this matter. 
Sound (10/10):
The soundtrack for HxH compliments every scene perfectly, particularly during fight scenes where the music will have you on the edge of your seat, or covered in goosebumps at how awesome it is. I love the opening theme as well. Although coming back to my earlier point of HxH surprising you with how dark it suddenly turns within the story, the opening is a prime example of this. The opening theme is happy and feel-good. It does not give you a full outlook on how dark the story turns suddenly. Ending themes are also fun to listen to, particularly during the first arc. The band who wrote that ending song for the first arc have quickly become one of my favourite Japanese artists. 
Characters (10/10):
Some of the most interesting characters I've ever come across in anime. I won't say much because many spoilerinos. But you will love almost all of the characters in some. Personally I enjoy villains, so to see a large number of them in this anime was piqued my interest of this series even more. If you can do a villain to such a good standard that you like them more than the main characters, you're doing a banging job like. Togashi does just this in the manga and the anime portrays them perfectly. 
Enjoyment (10/10):
I don't even think I have to say how much I enjoyed this series. One of the, if not the best anime series out there. It rivals FMA Brotherhood for best anime ever for me. This series will never get old. I consider it that good that I wished I never watched it in the first place because I want to watch it afresh again, without knowing any details. Such an unreal piece of work by both mangaka and anime studio. The only thing I can say that was probably the least enjoyable part of the series is that it had to end again, due to the mangaka not publishing any further chapters. For HxH anime fans, I'd highly recommend reading the manga from the point the anime left it on. And for manga and anime fans of this series alike, pray to any God you believe in that a new chapter is out soon. 
Overall (10/10):
Absolutely amazing series. For those who have started watching anime, or those who have been watching for years, I urge you to watch this series as soon as possible. It is highly underlooked by the anime community, for no good reason. Anyone who has not seen this series is missing out on one of the best anime around. Forget Naruto (which totally steals the chakra basis from HxH, js) and all the other mainstream series at the minute. Put this at the top of your watching lists and just enjoy anime at its best. For anyone who reads this, pray to the manga Gods that Togashi writes another chapter soon.",10
"
                Well I started to see this series after i've seen the first series and read the manga, i really enjoyed the first series and ova's so i gave this one a shoot and because i wanted to see that great manga animated as well.
I've really had a great time watching this series, in my opinion HxH was one of the best mangas to get an anime, the amazing art that Togashi had in the manga was pretty well passed to the anime, and this had become one of the series that i liked as much as the manga.
The characters are very well done, and had
                  a lot to be worked on, one of my favorites is Hisoka, but Alluka was a very good surprise with all that power and everything that she had all around her for her protection.
In overall i gave the series an 8/10, compared to other series i've seen HxH had all together, the story started a bit childish but it got more complex as it was growing and it gets to be a really good one, in the start of the chimera ant arc the animation and the story seemed to slow down a bit, but close to the end the animation and the story got better, and the final fight between Netero and the King was awesome, just like in the manga, and the final episode of the arc with the king and kumogi dying was one of the best from the series.
This last arc was the one i was most afraid of seeing in the anime because it could be very boring, but it was also amazing, madhouse made a awesome job animating the series.
Now we just have to wait for the manga to advance more so a new series can start.",8

                This is going to be a short review. *very small spoilers*
First of all, people who put 1 and say this is terrible yet talk about redeeming values and some characters they like are TOTAL HYPOCRITS. If you like something about an anime, its not a 1, you're just brigading.
This is the most creative shounen out there bar none. Many people who dont like HxH also say they dont like shounen, might as well say they dont like anime while we're at it because its the biggest genre. I swear someone who rated this 1 also rated the pingpong movie 10, yes the one with terrible
                  art. Im not saying that ping pong movie aint good, but hell you see what I'm talking about? People who know will know that's all I'll say.
*** On with the actual review and less ranting about stupid people ***
ALL the characters in this show are very unique, and one look at them and you realize there are multiple defining characteristics only from the way they look. Like the 3 side-characters who look most the same are 3 brothers so its entirely justified. Lets take a few minor characters who show up for an arc or so:
Zepile: Zepile is an antiquity appraiser who has some nen ability(nen being the ""chakra"" of HxH), he has unique eyebrows and a likeable personality. You see him in like 3-4 episodes but he still leaves an impression and you see him again as a cameo later. Zepile throws some appraising wisdom at you LEFT AND RIGHT for the short moments he is on screen, indicating the author is familiar with auctions and antiquities.
Bizeff: Bizeff is the ""shadow"" leader of a totalitarian nation. He recreated a small town in an underground bunker only to have ""relationships"" from women he handpicks from a catalogue. This shows a deep understanding of human politics from the author. Not only that, but towards the end, the author succeeds in making a man like Bizeff relatable to the audience somehow... 
Pokkle and Ponzu: Those two are initially shown separated in the hunter exam arc, and during that arc you see that they are pretty different. One uses bees as a weapon, the other a bow, and they dont talk with each other. However, in a later arc 80 episodes later you see them again and this time they are together, indicating they met and kept in contact offscreen. Not only that but they are used a MAJOR way during this new arc. I won't spoil it tho...
All the little details like this of the characters and plot, means that in order to understand most of those details you will NEED to watch this show multiple times, as I have.
The music is also masterpiece level. I get goosebumps from many of them.
The bad:
Initial design of Gon, honestly he looks dumb lol but once you know him and the story it makes sense.
The arc right after the hunter exam arc(the first one) is pretty slow and weird, but it serves well as a set up for the future so it all adds up in the end.
Conclusion: HxH is amazing and anyone saying otherwise probably doesnt have the ability for critical thinking.",10
"
                ""There's something more important than the world right now"", and that something is friendship which is probably the major theme in this series. 
Story: The story is about a boy who's 12 years old in the beginning named Gon, in the broadest view the show is about Gon's goal which is to find his dad, and in this journey to find his dad he comes across other situations which he must overcome in order to full fill his main goal, it's basically little goals setup to the main goal which explains why this show has multiple arcs on the different situations which he must over
                  come. 
The story however doesn't just resolve around gon only, Gon throughout the show meets up with 3 other major characters, one of them being Killua who becomes Gon's best friend. Within each arc we see these major characters trying to reach their goal. One thing i love about the show is how it doesn't always make the good guys look good, in many anime's we see the show try to make the villain or antagonist seem extremely bad so we don't feel bad for them if they die. In this show it's different and the reason we should all love this anime, instead of making the antagonist look bad they show their opinions and their view in the world. This way we better understand them and feel different towards them. 
The story mainly consist of a tournament which is always fun to watch, adventure, background stories, competition involving many fight scenes, and protection of the wealthy such as prestige characters which we see Kurapika doing who one of the 3 major character gon meets.
CHARACTERS: With Gon and Killua it's pretty basic and probably something we've seen before, Gon and Killua are both prodigies which means that although they're young, they have extreme potential. Some example where we see prodigies are Full metal alchemist,  Shokugeki no Souma, and even naruto having Sasuke being full of potential and promise. 
Although Gon and Killua follow this trait they are still extremely unique and special such as their background story and the way they deal with situations. An example could be with Killua's train of thought in combat situations.  
All the characters in the show are unique and has a great variety, i personally can't find any character good or bad that i hate, i may dislike one character cause they're in the way but you can't hate any of them. Even the villains have so much characterisation you come to like the character such as Hisoka. Most if not all the characters we've seen comes back into the story and plays apart in it, we don't see a character in one arc and disappear for the rest of the series. instead they reappear which emphasises HxH efforts in characterisation.
IMPORTANT NOTES:
-throughout the show you might disagree or dissatisfied with how an event took it's turn, an important note to take is to trust the producers and the story writer because in the end, you will be satisfied with it. Basically you need to trust the producer and story teller because they will find a way to make you comfortable with the ending of a scenario.
-if you don't like the anime keep watching it until you reach about episode 10, the first couple episodes are sorta misleading because it's mostly the setup of the main show such as introducing 2 of the 3 major characters in the anime.
-If you are discouraged by the cover and don't wanna watch it because it's about younger protagonists then you need to keep in mind that HxH age recommendation is 17+, this show was not made for younger viewers.
CONCLUSION: This anime is probably the best i've seen, the main story of finding Gon's dad isn't really exciting but it's the journey that makes the show 10/10 with all the teaching Gon and Killua learned. One reason i binged watched this show is the characters because i wanted to see more of them because of how unique each and everyone of them are. Almost every episode leaves with a tiny cliffhanger just enough to convince you to watch one more episode. If you love anime with tournament and competition along with concentrated fight scenes this is for you. If you enjoy any of the following: Naruto, Full metal alchemist, or even fairy tale this show is for you.
Things you can take from this anime:
-Everybody deserves a friend.
-Only takes one friend to change your entire life.
-Be nice to others because they'll return the favour.
-Give and don't expect to get.
-Respect your opponent such as sports.
-Defend your beliefs.
-Never abandon a friend.
-Trust your friend.
-You don't have to have similarities to be friends.
-Never judge a person's personalty by it's cover, its about experience with that person.
-And appreciate the people who are with you now and what they have done to get you where you're at.",10

                * * *Spoiler free* * *
I can't deny that I knew I was going to love this show from the get-go. I grew up watching Yuu Yuu Hakusho when Adult Swim was first airing it in the early 2000's, and I used to wish I could be as slick as fourteen year old Yusuke Urameshi. My brother and I would pretend we were the protagonists and he'd beat the absolute shit out of me (as strange as it sounds those were defining childhood memories for me). In addition, it was my first exposure to anime (aside from Pokémon, but let's just slide that under the
                  rug for now), so naturally I have a soft spot for Togashi's works.
Hunter x Hunter is the spiritual successor to YYH, and having watched both, I would certainly say that HxH is a vast improvement in Togashi's authorship. It's not a masterpiece, but it's damn good. If you are choosing between watching the '99 and '11 adaptations... without a doubt, choose this version. The '99 version dropped the ball, but fortunately Madhouse nailed it the second time around. I was brought to tears, I laughed, I felt the immense tension, and I admired the characters. I loved it all.
Story- 8/10
Adventure, action, mystery, suspense, a dash of romance here and there- the whole shebang. As I mentioned before it's not perfect, but it certainly exceeds expectations. The lore and plot are fairly solid. There are few plot holes, (nothing goes unexplained, and the explanations never made me feel like the writers thought I was a retard *cough cough DATTEBOYO*) and everything culminates coherently/satisfyingly in the ending.
I'm aware that the manga is ongoing, but I felt that the final episode was a perfect ending to the adventures of Gon and his unlikely best friend Killua, so I'm fine with the show being put on hiatus. Admittedly, I don't wish for the series to continue because it could lose momentum and lessen the story we've already been given.
Art- 10/10
Gorgeous. Just gorgeous. The world of HxH is fleshed out very well and has various haunting, beautiful, and dangerous settings. The animation is unique and flows smoothly. The fights grow increasingly intense as the story progresses, and they are some of the fastest paced/ well choreographed fights I've ever seen in anime. Extremely visually pleasing.
Sound- 9/10
The soundtrack is great. Some of the tracks that are thrown into the mix are absolutely perfect (in particular, a few of the tracks that are used in the tail-end of the series). SFX of the fights and powers all sound superb as well.
Character- 10/10
This category is where Hunter x Hunter shines. The characters and their developments are extremely well thought out and often impressed me. There are so many characters to love and to hate. It's rare that a series can present defining characters AND develop them with careful planning and meaningful conflict. I could go on and on for hours about why I hated or loved the characters that stood out. I'm not one to lose sleep over what happens to characters I don't like/care about, but I found myself immediately invested in many HxH characters; right from the beginning there were quite a few characters that I hoped would/wouldn't die. *Clap clap*
Enjoyment- 9/10
I enjoyed all aspects. I thoroughly enjoyed the story that unfolded between our protagonists Gon and Killua. Some would say that Gon is the ""main character"", but I disagree with that. I believe that the core of this series is about the relationship between the two. Gon, a simple minded yet strong willed child, becomes a hunter to track down his runaway father, meeting Killua at the start of this quest. The prodigal Killua wants to escape the life his father has laid out for him as successor of the 'family business'. So, the two team up and set out on their respective mission, forming an unbreakable bond along the way.
Overall- 10/10
It's a really well rounded show and I'd absolutely recommend it. If anything, at least add it to your plan to watch list; it's certainly worth a try. The power scaling is decent and the events that unfold seem believable within the bounds of the inexplicable world of Hunter x Hunter. I know that I sound like a raging fan boy but I didn't expect to like this show as much as I did.",10

                Hunter × Hunter (Which will hereafter be referred to as H×H) is an action/adventure series produced by Studio Madhouse and adapted from the manga of the same name by Yoshihiro Togashi. This is the second anime adaptation of H×H, the first being done by Nippon Animation, which was divided into multiple contiguous parts by OVA (Original Video Animation) that continued the story from where the original series ended. This was done because the manga is still ongoing and the studio needed to wait for the author to publish more chapters to continue adapting the material. This new series, coming much later than the original, starts
                  from the very beginning of the manga and discards everything about the original anime, and as such it doesn't have any issues the original had. They both cover the same material, but this adaption manages to go much further in the story. I haven’t seen the original series and thus cannot comment on the quality of it, but I can tell you this newer adaptation is easily one of the best manga to anime adaptations I have ever seen, and any fan of ongoing series aimed at the younger male demographic will find a lot to enjoy here.
H×H stars Gon, a gifted young boy living on Whale Island. Gon was left on Whale Island by his father, Ging, to live with his Aunt Mito. This is because Ging is what is known as a Hunter, a special rank that allows him to travel the world and use the resources of the Hunter Organization to aid his “hunt.” There are many different kinds of Hunters which you’ll see throughout the show, and the first part of the series focuses on Gon’s quest to become a Hunter himself. To do this, he must obtain a Hunter’s License, but doing so won’t be easy. Early on, he’s joined by a few friends. Leorio, a tall young man who is always seen in a business suit and wishes to become a Hunter for monetary gain. Kurapika, a young man from the Kurta tribe who wishes to avenge his people. And finally Killua, a boy the same age as Gon who also seems to be incredibly gifted. All four of them are trying to become Hunters for their own reasons, and the focus on each of them shifts throughout the entire 148 episodes. Side characters also occasionally get a piece of the limelight, but this is always a temporary situation that changes from arc to arc. The series also has somewhat of a main antagonist that is present in almost every arc, but this character isn't purely evil and his role isn't even entirely antagonizing Gon and his friends. All of the characters are enjoyable for the most part, although some of the side characters can be a bit bland, notably the main villain in an arc during the middle of the series. This is an uncommon problem though, and for the most part you’ll enjoy the characters populating the screen whether they be good or bad.
The music and animation in H×H is excellent as well. The soundtrack is composed mostly of orchestral music, and it has a very exciting and fun feeling to it. During the more serious scenes, it also manages to set the mood right, although many pieces end up being used quite a bit due to the long length of the show. This extends to the opening which only features changes in animation and occasionally the lyrics of the song being different. It’s still the same song throughout, however, so you may end up getting sick of it by the end and wish to skip it. The animation amazingly manages to stay consistent over all 148 episodes. For a series of this length, it looks surprisingly good, and Madhouse should be lauded for managing to keep the animation and art quality so high over such a long run. The actions scenes in the show are blazing fast and look fantastic, and the slower parts look equally as good with little motion going on. Although I found there are very few points where the animation manages to overly impress, the standard set through the entire run is impressive and should be very pleasing for the viewers watching.
However, there are a few areas where H×H falters. My biggest gripe with the series was the inconsistent tone between the first and second half. The first 70 or so episodes are all fairly light-hearted, barring the occasional violent moment, but the second half pulls out all the stops and becomes brutal both with its themes and the violence depicted. The change in tone is very sudden and will either be a breath of fresh air from the previous arcs, or a huge disappointment if you really enjoyed everything from before and didn't want it to change. I personally enjoyed the mature shift in tone, but I also wasn't the biggest fan of the first 70 episodes. They were enjoyable for me, but not to the point that I really loved the series. The last half really did it for me, but your mileage may vary. Unfortunately, the final arc also has some pacing issues. There is an all-out battle where several characters are fighting separately towards a common goal, and during this portion, the pacing is very grating. Certain minor characters end up overstaying their welcome, which really dampened my enjoyment of these episodes. The events that happen are still interesting, I just wish they could have condensed this part so it didn't go on for as long, but I was otherwise pleased with how everything else went. Another thing that may hamper your enjoyment is that the manga H×H is still ongoing, and as such this anime adaption does not cover the entire story. Luckily though, Madhouse still managed to end things on a satisfying note, so even if you never see more H×H after this, you will still get a sense of finality, albeit with a few loose ends not tied up. Another point that may turn you off to H×H is the various plot holes and bizarre story elements. The story for H×H is unfortunately a bit of a weak point, and at times the author employs narrative devices that feel cheap and don’t really make sense in the context of what’s going on. I found this to be a relatively minor problem until the final arc where a certain character is introduced that is completely broken in terms of what they are capable of. Again, it’s a pretty minor problem, but not one I can ignore.
In the end, H×H is an enjoyable experience marred by a few problems. It’s definitely worth watching if it interests you, but the experience is not perfect. A show of this quality definitely deserves attention, so give it a shot if it seem up your alley.",8

                Trying not to spoil!!!
Story 8/10
Characters 9/10
Hunter x hunter is anime that on  first look (especially the first episodes) looks as a typical shounen and even rather childish. We have our main hero, Gon who wants to find his father, is exceptional and gather friends along the way. However as the story progresses and I mean with the end of the first arc we start to notice that all the common shounen tropes get reversed. There is no nakama power, the reason the characters succeed is because of loses, hard work and friendship is not the only the reason for success. The main character, Gon
                  is not anymore a typical shounen MC with great ideals and nature that tells him to save everybody. As the story progresses, it is revealed his hypocrisy and selfishness which makes him more human and relatable. The other two main characters, Leorio and Kurapika, have their own lives and goals, and do not follow Gon wherever he goes. The last main character aka Gon's new bff Killua is as complex as Gon himself. His development as human and the change of his ideals is one of the most exceptionable in the series. Even the villains are not typical. Most of the time they have nothing in common with the supposed MC's Gon  and Killua. The goals of the villains, especially in Kurapika's character development arc, are disturbed by the MC solely because they want to help Kurapika not because these villains may kill hundreds of people. The other antagonist, that can be considered MC since they appear in almost every arc, is driven by their personal desires for fighting and often is extremely contrasting with themselves. In this way the border between good and bad gets smudged and even the main characters can't be considered good people especially Gon. 
Art 9.5/10
The art is not so outstanding but still amazing. Since the anime was started 2011 we could not expect the animation to be something out of this planet. However till its finish in 2014, the animation gets better and better. The last fights were so greatly animated that I had to watch them at least twice just because it was so flawless. The characters' feelings and thoughts can be tell just by looking at their eyes and body language. In overall in the beginning for me the art is 9/10 just because Madhouse thought that after so many years it wouldn't be so popular and they started with lower budged  and 10/10 for the progress in the animation.
Sound 10/10
The OST of hunter x hunter is one of the greatest I have listened to. It is diverse and epic but also sad and evoking memories.  Also it was used to provoke emotions according to the scene. It cannot be described by words, it just have to be listened too.
Enjoyment 10/10 or more
Till I watched it I have already abandoned the shounen genre because of the cliches and the overuse of everything. However hunter x hunter made me love every character even if they are ""bad"" or ""good"", all the characters had their own stories aside from the main story line and these stories were not abandoned. The shounen tropes got reversed and the story just became more, and more interesting. Also the feelings I felt and the feelings of the characters during the happy and sad moments were build up throughout the course of the story and were never without a reason or out of place. It was one of the few anime that made me cry like a baby and make me sweat with tension. 
Overall, without spoiling, hunter x hunter is one fresh anime in the shounen genre. With its complex relatable characters, with bad/good being smudged together, interesting storyline, great ost and mostly outstanding animation, hunter x hunter is one enjoyable emotional rollercoaster which will keep you entertained till the end.",10

                Hunter x Hunter is the longest anime I've watched at 148 episodes. That's about 2.5x the length of my second longest show, Avatar the Last Airbender.
I went for it because it was highly recommended by friends and highly rated. The show has a lot of strengths, but its length and pacing are huge problems that ruined it for me.
Characters: 9
Throughout the show, the majority of the characters are very well rounded.
The main characters are very good, but where the show really shines is with the villains. Their motives, their plotting, their interactions with the MCs. Every move they make draws you in. Each of the
                  villains is fresh and interesting, a big plus for this show.
Story: 8
This show usually implements a character-driven plot, and it turns out very well.
Character driven writing is widely considered the most realistic and entertaining, albeit difficult, method. This means that the situations the characters find themselves in are not put there because they sound cool, but are the natural falling out of the characters' interactions and motives.
Since the show has strong characters, this makes for a series of very good story arcs.
Length: 2
Well, at least the arcs' synopses would sound great, but in reality it's a hyperextended pile of disappointment.
This is where the Hunter x Hunter's biggest flaw comes into play. The creators seem to have had an episode quota to meet. Rather than tight, action-packed episodes that take you for an immersive ride, you end up slogging through solid episodes of exposition, or realizing that the 20 minute episode you just watched could have been handled in 5 or 10 minutes and been more entertaining. This results in the big impact scenes being too isolated to have the intended impact. You feel excited, or sad, or whatever, but you're left with the impression that it should have been so much more.
Unfortunately, you can't just skip episodes, because each one has some important content and a lot of wasted time. Thinking back over the amount of plot and character that happens in Hunter x Hunter, it's very comparable to Avatar: The Last Airbender. Thus, I think I would have had a much better time with this show if it had been a more appropriate 60 to 70 episodes.
Art and Animation: 9
The animation is great, nothing much to say here.
Sound: 7
The sound was a bit of a weak point in two ways: lack of music variety, and everyone's ""intense"" voice.
I won't hate on the music too much. The songs themselves were great, especially the themes for the different villains. The songs just get old if you binge the show, which I did for part of it.
The intense voices are a bit worse though. Whenever anyone gets upset they have a super-typical yelling voice that they all do. It gets really old, and they do it in a lot of situations where a normal voice would have been better. 
Enjoyment: 5
There were a lot of good moments, but not enough for 148 episodes.
Looking back, there were a lot of really good moments in this show, which makes me question my low score here. However, the incredible number of ""normal"" episodes where nothing remarkable happens were not very enjoyable. It seems like they thought that the most important ingredient in a  good finale is a 12-episode long fight.
(I set Enjoyment at 3 on the rating scale to take my Length critique into account.)
Overall: 6
six is an average score, but this isn't an average show. It is a show that should have been exceptional but decided to drag on forever and kill the excitement. I really loved the good moments in this show. I actually almost cried a couple times. The thing is that I should have been weeping at those scenes but they got the pacing so wrong.
I would not take the time to watch this show again, and I cannot, sadly recommend it for a first time.",6

                NO SPOILER!!!
The first word that comes to mind when I think about Hunter x Hunter is undoubtedly: VARIETY. With everything from insane, heart-raising action to comedy so ridiculous that I laugh alone in my room on numerous occasions; Hunter x Hunter is an anime that quickly shot to my number 1 favorite and only secures it's place more determinedly with every episode.
At this point, although still ongoing, I'm roughly halfway through HxH and I've loved every single minute of it. That's because in this show, every minute matters. You can't look away without missing something crucial, hilarious or just generally entertaining. I was a late
                  comer to the HxH bandwagon and after around 10 episodes, I was sorely angered with myself for leaving it this late. All I can say now is thank heavens I finally gave this anime a shot. NEWCOMERS. DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE LENGTH. WHEN YOU START WATCHING; IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER ANYMORE. Where I first found myself concerned as to whether I'd have the time or motivation to catch up with this anime, I now find myself worried about catching up and having to wait a week for each episode! And man, do those episodes fly by. The best anime are the ones that make it impossible to say 'okay, that's enough for now'. 
The array of interesting and unique characters is what really makes this series. HxH is not afraid to go with the cliche, make fun of the cliche, experiment with the dark and creepy, the light and fluffy, and everything in between. With 2 adorable yet terrifyingly powerful protagonists and their ever-changing company, you're guaranteed to come across multiple characters that you love, hate or just plain can't get your head around. But even without the constantly growing cast, Gon and Killua really do make this a special anime. Watching the two grow (albeit quite quickly with the pace of the anime) and experiencing all the WONDERS OF FRIENDSHIP AND SELF DISCOVERY is easily the main reason for my love of this anime. Not forgetting, of course, creepy-ass perv Hisoka on the side is just the cherry on the cake.
Overall this anime is just plain fun. It's addictive, interesting, varied and entertaining in every sense of the word. It really is an anime that has something for everyone. WATCH IT.",10

                ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***
Perfect anime for pseudo-intellectuals.
Meruem - the author simply copied the character arches of Majin Buu or Sesshoumaru. 
The funny thing is that Sesshoumaru as a character and his acceptance of people arc is much better written but most anime people don’t care how and what is written, the main thing is hype and that “smart” youtubers would praise more and HxH win in this thinks.
So Kaito didn’t even die, that’s the problem)) Hunter is such a toothless title that he can’t even kill a super secondary character like Kaito, even here Togashi unscrewed the bullshit twist saying he was reborn into another
                  body)) needless to say that this completely kills the whole drama what was being said about his death? I think no) And this can be said about the whole plot of the hunter - a drama at the level of the first class, a simple, straightforward, insipid, uninteresting plot, the characters are the same. In the hunter, on the fingers of one hand, you can count the characters that you develop (even if you don’t have all the fingers on your hand).
This anime pissed me off when they introduced the bugs. No, it’s not that it didn’t infuriate me before, but it’s so easy to turn the story somewhere in the wrong direction, cutting out secondary characters unnecessarily, just for emotional effect. It's just a cheap trick. I don't fall for that kind of shit.
But nothing infuriated me in this anime more than the main character. It just doesn't work. This is a doll without emotions that sometimes imitates them, but somehow it is not believable. He smiles - I don't believe him, he gets angry - I don't believe him, he's sad - but I don't. This is the worst anime protagonist I have ever seen. I don't feel his emotional connection to the other characters. I don't see any morality in his actions. It is completely empty inside. He needs a purpose in order to continue living, and this is not some kind of purpose as for some living person. No, he doesn't need a goal, he needs a task. Find a father, get a license, buy the game, beat the game, go to the island to fight the bugs (why the fuck!), but who is Gon when not going through the story? Absolutely no one. He has no purpose in life, no desires of his own. He is like a playable character in a computer game. Only you don’t need to play this game, he passes it on autopilot. And I can only watch him.
It looks like a slightly darker fairy tail. Far from a masterpiece. And in some places it looks frankly boring (and to such an extent that you start tearing your hair on your head, shouting into the sky: “Why are they shooting like that ?!”). The drama is neutered, the characters are neutered, even those that are good are good only in the background. I notice that in Naruto, indeed, many ideas migrated, but Kishimoto greatly improved them.
How does this anime even have a fan base, much less a fan base that considers this a masterpiece? It's a shame to have such bad taste, comrades. Well, I really don’t understand why they like it, how they look at it ...",1
"
                I truly cannot understand and will never understand why this show is rated so highly and critically acclaimed. First of all Gon is not even very likeable, he's okay, not bad but not what I want from a main character. Especially not from a battle shounen main character that is supposed to carry the plot. Kurapika is so overdone it's almost painful. Not to mention he takes his powers and backstory from at least 5 different characters. Leorio is just awful, everytime he's on screen I can't wait for him to be off screen. And lest we forget about killua the biggest do nothing of
                  the entire show. Killua could have given this show redemption but he was just another example of poor character writing. I wanted to like this show and I tried. I trudged through episodes that went nowhere. Characters and plots that made no sense. Story arc that were cheap plot devices rather than being an actual hero's journey. This show is so boring and plain and overused. Seriously do yourself a favor and watch a good battle shounen.",3
"
                I will try not to spoil anything, though it's hard to get my points across without explaining a few things...
Story-There is not one person who has grazed the story of Hunter x Hunter that has watched it and said ""I hate this anime"". This may surprise some of you who have only seen the opening and maybe watched the first episode.
From first watch, and after watching the first four episodes, this anime may seem to feel like any other shonen: You've got the main male character who is goofy and underestimated but is really powerful. You've got the adventure and the search to become something
                  more powerful (the ""Gotta Catch em All"" syndrome). And, at first, it seems the main character can do no wrong.
There are some things we just expect from shonen. And there are some things about Hunter x Hunter that can remind you of other shonens.
But there are far greater differences between this anime and other shonens. I would even compare it to Seinen if the episodes didn't carry an element of youth (not the kind of youth people would expect though).
If you are someone that is open to main characters who are kids and you're looking for a happy, light adventure story, stop this anime after episode 4. If you are looking for something deeper, something horrific, and something that jerks your heart strings, KEEP WATCHING.
You may think I'm saying that Hunter x Hunter offers something for everyone. Really and truly, it doesn't. But it does happen to draw in a few suckers who are looking for something light and who have never watched a horror in their life only to destroy their dreams.
It is no wonder why this version of the anime doesn't have the strongest fanbase. It doesn't have any fan service (no real love story) and it is very close to the manga in its adaptation. Shouldn't these things make it popular? Well, at first glance, Hunter x Hunter seems like all the others. Closed-minded people will write it off before it even gets past episode 1 because it seems like such a cliche anime, with the upbeat opening and the young kids hopping and skipping everywhere.
But trust me. It is not what it seems.
For lovers of shonen, this may not feel as fun for them. It doesn't deliver the same way most shonens do. In most shonens, the main character's goal is to be the master of some sort or to get revenge or avenge someone else. Therefore, fighting is usually a consistent theme in most shonen (Though I'd question Princess Tutu). But in this shonen, the main character's goal was not to become a master in any way. He was only trying to find his father. Thus, fighting was only an asset to achieving what he wanted, but not mandatory. The story was focused on teaching Gon the realities of being a hunter and the truth about the way his father lived, who was also a hunter.
(From the synopsis, you might not know just how deep and scary this story is. This story put me right back into the horror genre I was trying to avoid. It feels like the genre follows me like a plague.)
The first arc focuses on this Hunter Exam, where Gon meets many of his friends throughout the series.
The rest of the arcs are deeper and more involved. I can't really get into detail about them because I don't want to give too much away. It would be hard to describe them without giving too much away and I want you readers to really enjoy this anime. It's worth it. Trust me, you'll stay up late trying to stuff 90 episodes into one day.
The arcs include: The Hunter exam arc, the Zoldyc Family arc, the Heavens Arena Arc, Yorknew City Arc, Greed Island Arc, Chimera Ant Arc, and the 13th Hunter Chairman Election Arc. There is supposed to be one more arc but the creator has gone on a hiatus. He goes on hiatus several times throughout the manga and anime runs. The newest arc is supposedly called the Dark Continent Arc. 
Every arc is different which makes it anything but repetitive, unlike most shonen.
The lightest arc is obviously the Heavens Arena arc. The deepest and darkest is the Chimera Ant arc, though I found Yorknew City to be a close second.
This anime is a mixture of Dragonball Z and Attack on Titan as far as story goes. I really didn't come in expecting much of anything in particular, but I was told to expect the anime to get darker. But I did not expect it to get as dark as it got.
But you know, I've seen worse. Shonen anime isn't on the level of other horror  genres. The themes of friendship and the feeling that the main character will save the day somehow makes this anime one step away from being a like horror genres I've watched, especially in Seinen. (Sometimes they can be so horrific for just no reason. La Chavelier D'Eon did it for me. That completely took me out of the horror genre.)
For an anime that is 148 episodes long, not one episode feels out of place, unnecessary, or dragging. In fact, the pacing of this anime is smooth and even throughout, surprisingly. I found myself wanting more, feeling like the anime was too short! 148 episodes really isn't enough! This anime has a way of making the viewer want to know what happens next because most of us know we will get the answers we want in the next episode. It doesn't waste time getting to the juicy stuff. The story is engaging throughout, covering many different emotions from the viewer: anger, sadness, happiness, fear, platonic love, and overall contentment.
What makes this anime different from other shonen is that it doesn't have any fan service or any episodes that are non-cannon. In other words, no ""filler"" episodes. Surprising for an 148 episode anime, right?
The story takes place in many places according to the arc. This is an adventure story, so obviously the main character never stays in one place. The main character is from Whale Island, a small island with a humble village. But it is not the only place we see more than once, so it makes the adventure refreshing and puts the animation to good use.
Characters-The main character is Gon, a rustic but flexible boy who is determined to be a hunter and find his father who abandoned him shortly after he was born. Though this character is the main character, he is not always the main focus throughout every arc. That makes him different from other shonen anime characters.
There are four other main supporting characters: Killua, his best friend from a family of assassins, Kurapika, his friend from the Kurta Clan, a clan of people with violet eyes, and Leorio, a young man who looks way too old and has a desire to be a doctor.
The characters are nothing particularly special. They are the typical characters you'd find in anime. Gon is the over-optimistic, honest boy who is super strong. Killua and Kurapika carry on Tsundere traits and make up for where the other is absent. Leorio is the character that provides comic relief (he reminds me of Kogoro Mouri from Detective Conan).
However, all characters show evolution, even if the evolution is small. Though they may be typical, things happen to them that test their personalities. Despite the fact that Gon is typical of most shonen, for example, his simple personality often has serious consequences throughout the anime. He is not as perfect as other shonen anime characters. Gon has moments where he loses and there is nothing he can do about it. He has moments where he is not strong enough to fight, where someone else wins where he fails. There are those in this anime that ARE stronger than him. And that is what makes his character so unbelievably tolerable for viewers who would normally despise such characters. It is that little slice of life that brings a wide range of fans to the anime.
(This anime has a way of making up for the weaknesses in most shonen anime.)
Many characters are introduced throughout every arc. Many of them become very important throughout the adventure. But just because they are friends of the main character, super strong, or important to the story doesn't mean they won't die. That's right. It doesn't mean they won't die...for good, too. Often times, things happen to characters in this anime that Gon, the main character, can never save.
It's best for the viewers not to become too attached to characters in this anime. You never know which cool character will be killed next, and sometimes in the most gruesome way. At the end of this anime, you will never smile again.
Still, it's so hard NOT to become attached, and that brings me to this anime's greatest let-downs: character background development and the usage of characters.
Some of the characters are treated as if they are expendable. Some characters are designed to show off awesome abilities and yet they fail to deliver, or some are put out there to be more important than they end up being. Two examples would be Baise and Pokkle. The female characters, as usual, showed the least evolution.
Still, at least the female characters were actually powerful and cool...That's more than I can say about other shonen anime.
Leorio, who is supposed to be considered one of the main characters, showed the least evolution, and ended up being a one-dimensional character. His evolution was worse than the characters who showed no relation to the main character.
And I understand this story is about Gon's father, but they copped out when it came to revealing information about Gon's mother, which could've been useful to his overall development.
Lastly, let me get down to the villains. Oooh, the juicy villains. Generally, there was a new antagonist every arc. The main antagonist, who seems to show up in most arcs, is Hisoka. Yea, he's a creep. Some of you might even think of him as a fruitcake, but I think that only adds to the fact that his overall presence is taboo. There is a lot more given to him than the Hunter Exam arc, however, his overall backstory wasn't developed enough. He is another character that I wished was elaborated on.
The most well-developed villain was the Chimera Ant King. He was from the most intense arc in the whole series and really his presence is unseen in shonen anime. Still, I wanted to know a little about his life ""before"" he was born, which could've been useful in the arc. You'd need to watch the series to know what I really mean.
Then there is the Phantom Troupe which inspired a Hunter x Hunter movie outside of the series. The troupe consists of a collection of merciless thieves. Really cool characters with awesome powers, but again, no real emphasis on their backgrounds.
Despite all of the things I wished were elaborated on, the characters were developed enough. It's hard not to understand or connect with the characters. Each character served their purpose in each arc, which was all that was needed to keep the story flowing. The story had a power all its own. The viewers are left valuing characters even stronger because so many could be lost within one episode, even characters that were amazing. Any character that was unimportant didn't last too long. Even some of the lead characters often had moments where they were excluded from the entirety of an arc if they were not considered important. But there wasn't one character that was just garbage. Still, some characters would've been a lot more interesting had their pasts been elaborated on.
The fact some characters weren't elaborated on within this series doesn't take away from the anime at all. In fact, it just adds to the anime's appeal. The anime has plenty of room to elaborate on characters that it didn't so far. The rumor is that the manga artist is just on a temporary hiatus. Who knows what the next couple of arcs or episodes will reveal. There is so much that can be worked into Hunter x Hunter without it ever really feeling like it's dragging on. It just has that feeling. It feels like the adventure can never truly end. The way the story is set up makes it feel like the main character will always have an adventure and will always meet people. And I'm okay with that, unlike with animes like Pokemon, Detective Conan, DragonBall Z, and even Naruto. This anime truly can never get old, really. I guess because no arc is the same as the last. There is nothing repetitive about this anime. There is just so much to explore with the hunters, there is no possible way it can truly run out of ammunition.So, I'm not too disappointed.
Still, there are some characters I really hope to learn more about in the future.
The 1999 version was better at developing the characters, but it's not as close to the manga. And that is a must for me.
Music-The musical scores are epic. Much of the instrumentals really capture the sense of adventure you might feel in the anime. However, the opening song, which is consistent throughout the series, is so upbeat it seems to hide the darkness of the story. But actually, that is exactly why this opening is the best.
The ending songs vary according to the arc and better fits with the arc it ends to.
Creator and Inspiration-The writer and illustrator of Hunter x Hunter, Yoshihiro Togashi, also wrote and illustrated YuYu Hakusho (for those of you who remember that anime; it's good, too) and Level E (also really good, but underrated). He's married to the woman who created Sailor Moon.
Hunter x Hunter, the original manga and anime, were released in 1998.
The artist had a hobby of collecting all sorts of objects and so wanted to make an anime that involved collecting. The name ""Hunter x Hunter"" was inspired from the Japanese show Downtown where the hosts of the popular variety show often repeated words for comedy.
The birth of the artist's first son influenced much of his work regarding Gon.
The writer/author of the series is very hard on his work, often apologizing for his ""poor artwork."". Because he doesn't hardly have any assistance with his work, he doesn't have anyone to finish for him when things come up in his life. He goes on several hiatuses for long extended periods of time. He went on hiatus in 2012, came back in 2014, and then went on hiatus two months after returning.
Dragonball Z was actually one of the inspirations behind much of the elements in Hunter x Hunter. It was the popular anime at the time.
One obvious character that is inspired from a creature in DBZ is the Chimera Ant King. The Chimera Ant King was inspired from Cell from Dragonball Z. He has the stinger on his tail, the green-ish body, and the black finger-nail polish. He also has an affinity for games, just like Cell did (remember the Cell games?). The King is also some higher cellular form that was meant to be invincible, just like Cell.
Animation-The animation is well-drawn. The details, like the forests, bodies of water, and creatures, all show lushness. The coloring captures the tone of the anime well, from the lighter moments to the darkest moments. Everything is felt, unlike in the 1999 version where everything felt colorless and lifeless.
Adaptations-There are two anime adaptations of the Hunter x hunter manga. There is a 1999 version and a 2011 version of this anime. Of the two, most fans say the 1999 version was darker, but it was not as true to the manga as the 2011 anime was. I feel that the 2011 version is darker in content, even though the coloring is brighter. I advise you watch the 2011 version first and if you feel like you just can't get enough, head on over to the 1999 version. Of the two, I prefer the 2011 version. I like adaptations that are closer to the original story. Then we can see the true artist's intentions.
Honestly, I haven't seen all of the 1999 version, but this review is mostly for the 2011 version. But so far based on what I've seen, there are significant differences:
1) The 1999 version drags on more than the 2011 version. The 2011 version has a quicker pace and jumps right into the action each arc.
2) The 2011 version follows the manga closer than the 1999 version.
3) The animation in the 2011 version is obviously more up-to-date but the 1999 version gives a feeling of nostalgia.
4) The 1999 version is darker. I suppose it's because the visuals are not as lush as they are in the 2011 version. The 1999 version also has darker themes that come from the fillers and the humor is edgier. But in content, the 2011 version is actually less censored despite what fans say. It also is less humorous than the 1999 version, believe it or not, and is sadder and more sentimental, making it feel more serious. Some feel like they can take the 1999 version more seriously because the main character isn't as righteous, but he is more of a comedian than in the 2011 version
http://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/1rxhwh/censorship_in_the_1999_anime_vs_censorship_in_the/
5) The 2011 version actually covers all the arcs that have currently been created, whereas the 1999 version ended after the Yorknew City arc and then there are some OVAs about Greed Island. It is missing one of the deepest arcs in the series, the Chimera Ant arc.
6) The 1999 version has stronger character development than the 2011 version.
Overall, I think this anime was fantastic. I recommend this anime to all anime lovers, though I know many who are interested in the Shoujo or Shonen genre may not be able to handle all of the gore and atypical endings. Still, it has a really good story and the characters are interesting. I doubt this anime could disappoint any viewers...Unless, you're a Negative Nancy about everything.
I give this anime a 9.5/10. It actually may deserve a 10 out of 10, but the simplicity of the characters don't make the characters stand out the best out of other shonen anime. I was also disturbed about the abandonment of many characters. It left me feeling a bit empty, like there were holes left untouched in the story. I really hope they clean this up in future arcs. I would like many characters, especially the ones considered important, to be touched on a little more.",9

                First of all, please apologize me for my English, I’m Spanish and this isn’t my first Language.
Hunter x Hunter 2011 was one of the best shonens ever made in the history of anime. But the main question is... why? Can an anime whose main character is a kid wearing green clothes with childish aspect be a masterpiece? Oh yes.
The best point about Hunter x Hunter is the fact that this anime avoids all the typical shonen cliches. In this anime you’ll find unexpected deaths, realistic fights, an amazing character development and, the best of all: it never gets boring.
I’m not even joking, one of the
                  main arcs is about president elections... and it’s fun and entertaining! 
Talking about the fight scenes, I can’t say anything but awesome. In my opinion, Hunter x Hunter has the best fights in all the anime (the fight between Netero and Meruem is simply spectacular) and the animation helps a lot this anime to be epic and dynamic. 
Another incredible aspect, is the OST, being childish and innocent at the beginning and dark and mature at the end. 
In my opinion, HxH is now one of the main pillars in the anime industry, an absolute masterpiece that you can’t miss.

                Hunter x Hunter.
Honestly i think that this is the one of the most enjoyment i have had watching an anime from the past few years. i will start off this review with a 'no spoiler mark'.
With that out of the way i can confidently say that if you gonna watch an anime that had come out in the last few year, add Hunter X Hunter on that list.
Story: 8/10
Hunter x Hunter's story is very simple. It Start off with our main character out on a quest to become a hunter and looking for his father. As with most action - shounen, the story is split
                  in to arcs, avg at about 21 episode each, tho some are more lengthy then others, for the most part the pacing is great when compare to most action - shounen. You are not going to see a mind bending twist in this anime, but the story is great and serve its purpose, it give the characters a goals and a sense of progression.
Art : 8/10
The art looks great in HxH Madhouse did a fantastic job (as always) with this one, everything from the world to the characters themselves. the only knocks i had with the art is ( and its not entirely the studio's fault ) it then to drive out people that are not use to see this type of art style after the 90's away. a lot of my friends simply just turn away from the show after the first few episode just because they can't stand the art style.  
Sound : 9/10
The sound in HxH was great. the voice actors did a superb job at most scenes and they did a good job at getting out the emotion of their characters. the tracks are great but with the exception of the intro and ending songs, it can get repetitive for some, altho i don't mind them. Even tho the intro song ''Departure!'' by ''Ono Masatoshi'' it the only intro song throughout 148 episode it did not get repetitive because they did a great job at changing to different part of the songs and the intro animation for each arcs. All of the endings is quite good as-well.
Character : 10/10
Now this is where HxH shine more then most anime, i can not remember the last time i had watched an anime with as good character development as Hunter x Hunter. This show just did it better then any show that i can remember, sure the main cast start off as generic anime prototypes kids, but that is what makes it so good, they are kids, that still have alot to learn about the worlds around them. The characters feel natural, you understand what they are doing and why, you start off knowing almost everything about everyone and under stand their action almost immediately. And as the series progresses so do they, you get to see how they have mature and change. Every action have a consequences, you pick a fight with someone who has been doing noting but battle with the best for his entire life?  you may be lucky if you can escape after a huge humiliation and few broken bones, no cheep power-ups during combat from a legendary demon that lives inside you Bullc***. It made the anime more believable and relate able. you under stand what makes and brakes them.
Enjoyment : 10/10
With the simple over arc story light tune art and excellent sound makes this anime very enjoyable to watch. the only nip pick i have with it is later on in the show there was a 4-5 stretch where is was kinda ''meh'' but that is nip picking as its bestest of forms.
Overall : 9/10
The Characters in this anime is it's main strong point, the main characters, the side characters. have lots of dept. the main cast character development throughout the story is outstanding, and some side characters from this anime is so strong that it may even outclass most of the main characters from some anime in the past years in dept and design. beside the characters this anime add noting new to the table in terms of.. well everything else. But it did them great, it just did not push any boundary. I recommencement you give it a try if you don't mind the art and liked any anime... at all.",9

                In my opinion, Hunter x hunter is one of the most overrated animes out there. The main reason I decided to get into this was cuz a friend was nudging me into it, the memes and the endless mentions of it in the comment sections of other animes I watched. As you might have guessed, we aren't friends anymore.
Honestly , I was not a big fan of the art style itself but I do manage to admire a few character designs such as the buffed up Zoldyck family and the Phantom Troupe guys. Coming to the story, I read in a lot of reviews that
                  this show was a reflection of many themes in life such as politics, war , conflict etc. After watching the anime though , I realized that these themes merely exist within the anime without any philosophy or deep meaning behind them. If anything, the series successfully managed to reinforce the concept of friendship through the heartwarming experiences between Gon and Killua. However, this does nothing to compensate for the terrible clichéd jokes, poor fight scenes and excessive narration. I watched this thing to the end and was super pumped for the inevitable fight between Neferpitou and Gon and I swear, I was more disappointed than Naruto's crew cut. In the Chimera Ant Arc , I was so fed up with the excessive narration that I was ready to toss my earphones off and just watch the whole thing without sound. The pacing was super crazy though. Apparently 3-5 episodes took a total of 5 minutes in the hunter X Hunter world. You can't even explain that with quantum mechanics.
Coming to the protagonist , I ABSOLUTELY did not like Gon by the end of the series. Initially, it was kinda anticipating to watch him go on encounters and chase his goal of pursuing his dad but as the series went on , he rarely developed his abilities or hardly got better at anything he did. Even though the boy is supposed to be a prodigy, the dude still had only one move by the end which he developed halfway through the series. At times, I got so annoyed by this guy's misplaced optimism and lack of common sense. Even though this is characteristic of several protagonists, Gon just kicks rationality out of his thought process and has everyone else hope for the better for no absolute reason. Killua was an absolute badass, and I may be biased cuz of his lightning which was so satisfying to watch . This guy is brutal and it's even fun to watch him bicker with woman and take care of Gon. I would have preferred to see Killua as the protagonist cuz he had the most development and meaningful arcs and even thrilling action sequences throughout the series. 
Conclusively , I would recommend this series to people who are just getting started with anime and have not watched major franchises like Naruto or Black Clover which are miles ahead of this. If you're an anime veteran with me who basically breathes anime for a living, stay away from it and don't bother with this. Even if you don't let the hype get to you, you're gonna be disappointed much more  than you think. I really want that one month back which I would have rather invested on rom-coms or saving for my body pillows.",4

                Hunter x Hunter 2011 is easily one of the greatest anime of all time. On mal it's the 4th highest rated as of right now and it deserves it for sure.
The anime is pretty much flawless is every sense of the word and there is almost no negatives about it. 
It's characters (protagonists and antagonists) , worldbuilding, tone, atmosphere, fights, comedy, emotional moments, symbolism and pretty much everything along those lines are all nailed to perfection.
To put the icing on the cake, The soundtracks, opening and endings songs are absolute magnificent.
Hunter x Hunter 2011 is one of the greatest anime adaptations of all time and
                  Madhouse really showed everyone what they are capable of. This will always be one of the best in my books.
I can't recommend this enough.",10

                Hunter x Hunter is a long running shounen series written by Togashi Yoshihiro. You may know him as the author of Yu Yu Hakusho and the husband of Takeuchi Naoko, the writer of Sailor Moon. The still ongoing manga has gotten several anime adaptations. One from '99- '01, a thirty episode OVA from '02-'04 and a Madhouse series that started airing in 2011 and ran until 2014. The Madhouse series is the one we'll be looking at today. I did like Yu Yu Hakusho well enough, so let's see how this one compares.
Story:
Our narrative is set in a world where an elite group of hunters
                  has a lot of fame, prestige and performs dangerous tasks. Each year there's an exam to determine what young blood will be allowed to join the Hunter's organisation. We follow twelve year old Gon Freecss, son of a famous hunter, who's preparing to take the exam and follow in his father's footsteps. And, since this is a long shounen action series, after that arc ends we have a good half dozen more.
Let's begin, as I usually do, with the negatives about the story. The biggest flaw is the “romance” element. No, it's not actual romance but that's the quickest way to succinctly describe it before going into the details. Gon and his equally young friend, Killua, attract a lot of attention from older characters. There are multiple guys who seem to get sexually aroused from battle who develop something of a fixation on the two of them and there's a woman in her twenties who forces Gon to go on a date with her. Now, to the series' credit these blatant paedophiles are shown as, at best, having dark personalities even if they're technically allied with the heroic group. So, at least there's some acknowledgement that what they're doing is not all right. But it's still pretty bloody creepy to have that level of sexual fixation directed at twelve year olds. Especially since no one in the series seems to ever acknowledge the issue with it. The series also does, like every other long shounen action anime I've seen, have its share of filler. Although it's probably the least egregious offender I've seen in that regard. At least in terms of 100+ episode action anime.
Let's move on to the praise. There are a lot of good things about this series. First off, it does subvert a lot of the traditional shounen tropes. Gon isn't the ultimate, most powerful person of all who comes in after his friends get their anuses torn open and just cleans up. We see a lot of stronger characters and some who are easily on the same level with him. He frequently isn't even the one who will finish a battle. He'll make definite contributions, but he won't be the key to everything working. Which gives the other characters a reason to be there beyond acting as fodder. The series is also good about setting up scenarios that, in any other action series, would end in a very particular way and then ending them in a different way that works better with the narrative. There's a clear Dragonball inspiration which the series uses well by taking certain concepts and putting its own unique spin on them. Remember Goku's Janken attack? Well, Gon has his own Janken inspired attack but his is different and stays relevant. Killua also gets a technique that's visually similar to a super saiyajin and the main antagonist of the chimera ant arc absorbs people to grow stronger, rather like Cell but, aside from that, the two villains aren't very alike. Our heroes find a teacher who looks at dirty magazines, like Roshi, but never harasses anyone and is just a far stronger character. I actually like her a lot. I've seen enough series that are blatant rip-offs (The Law of Ueki) and series that just verbatim follow cliches, that it's impressive when you find one like this that wears its inspiration clearly but also is its own unique entity.
In terms of the strength of the arcs, they range from decent to excellent. The chimera ant arc is definitely the strongest, with a lot of development for the antagonists, a story that really builds on the prior events of the series, it has the most tragic, heart-wrenching scene I've seen in a while & it opens up quite a few possibilities for future events. The Greed Island arc, in contrast, is the weakest. It's the only arc that's just decent. It has its strong suits like Biscuit Kreuger, some very inventive action sequences, allowing us to see certain characters in a new light and Biscuit Kreuger. It also drags more than anything else in the series, features the least interesting antagonists and it's the arc that plays a lot of shounen tropes the safe and predictable way. Which gets a bit dull.
Characters:
In general, I really like the cast in this series. I don't know why we need paedophile characters. They seem completely unnecessary. I also find Leorio a bit insufferable. The dude basically only succeeds at anything because the people around him prop him up and he's just a total swine. Although, I can't really fault the series for his writing since he does have verisimilitude. I've known people who were very much like that and I couldn't stand them either. The antagonist writing is largely well done. All of the antagonists in this have some redeeming qualities. Even the Greed Island antagonists have this sense of camaraderie among them. Which might not be much but it's something. There isn't a single character in this series who's devoid of verisimilitude.
I can't go over every single character in great detail, so I'll just mention some of the major ones. Gon and Killua are our main boys, playing a major role in everything. In some ways, Gon seems like the dumb but good-natured shounen protagonist but it becomes clear, very quickly, that he's not stupid. He's naïve because he's twelve and has spent most of his life on a small island. He's also highly observant and can be very cunning when he has a strong grasp of a situation. Killua initially seems like the character who has a dark past and that's going to be the excuse for everything they do. However, he quickly distinguishes himself from that character type by being quite cheerful instead of dark and brooding. He also distinguishes himself through his strong friendship and loyalty towards Gon. Usually that character is established as a rival for the main hero who really wants to be stronger than them and will never admit to liking them. As the series progresses, he also starts to get a lot more of a conscience. He's still pragmatic about killing when the situation calls for it, but he focuses a lot more on protecting others. Especially Gon and his little sister who shows up towards the end.
Another character I want to talk about is Komugi. She is the character who really solidifies the chimera ant arc as the best. Before she shows up, the antagonists are under-developed and they've shown basically nothing redeemable besides hints of the same type of camaraderie that were displayed in the Greed Island arc. That changes with the introduction of Komugi, a blind little lass who gets brought in to entertain the king. By playing a game, get your minds out of the gutter. She quickly starts to form a genuine bond with him that he doesn't really understand and that his loyal guards don't know how to react to. This bond becomes central to the character development of the antagonists in the arc and involves some of the best written scenes in the entire series. And she's an interesting character too. She doesn't want to bother anyone due to her physical limitations but she's not weak. She has a lot of mental fortitude and once she's resolved she doesn't change her mind. It's fascinating to watch her even when a lot of what happens in her scenes revolves around playing a game with ill-defined rules.
Art:
For starters, I have to address the character designs. Some of them are kind of typical; bright-eyed lad with crazy hair and such. But a lot of them are quite unique. The chimera ants have fascinating designs. Even the ones largely based off of one animal have an insect-like influence that makes them more than your typical furry fodder. I also appreciate that the female characters have a lot of diversity. In a lot of these shounen series you'll get the attractive ladies in major roles and, maybe, some unattractive ones who get thrown in for a scene or two as a jape. In this one, one of the major female characters looks like she'd fit in with the muscular machismo of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. There's another, Senritsu, who looks kind of like a Friar Tuck cosplayer. There are also ones like Komugi, who looks rather plain aside from her gigantic eyebrows. The action sequences in this are really stellar. The Nen element allows for a wide variety of different techniques and styles without going overboard to the extent where anything could happen and it would make sense. The animation is very fluid and the world just looks really good.
Sound:
The acting is really damn good. Like with the characters, I can't talk about every single actor but I'll bring up a few who stand out. Our main heroes are voiced by Han Megumi & Ise Mariya, both of whom deliver superb performances. Tominaga Miina, the voice of Senritsu, also stands out. She sounds very melodic and she's just a joy to listen to. Endou Aya, Yokoyama Chisa & Uchiyama Kouki also stand out for their superb work as Komugi, Biscuit Kreuger & Meruem. Paku Romi is also in this and her character is named Paku. We have Hirano Yoshihisa to thank for the awesome soundtrack. You may also know him from his work on Death Note & Strawberry Panic.
Ho-yay:
There's a bit. I already mentioned the men who seem to be aroused off of the idea of fighting twelve year old boys. There are also times where Killua's devotion to Gon and his response come across as being more than friendship. Honestly, they're the same age so I have no problem with that.
Final Thoughts:
That's Hunter x Hunter. When all is said and done, I do like it more than Yu Yu Hakusho. It has stronger arcs, character writing and is just generally superior. It's still not perfect and there are definitely things that could have been better handled but I can still heartily recommend it for action fans. My final rating is going to be an enthusiastic 8.5/10. Next week I'll look at Girls und Panzer der film.",8
"
                When i started this anime, it felt kinda slow. But i also felt this is going to be one hell of an anime, and my instincts were correct. 
A shounen that leaves you filled with joy, and gives you some of the most impressive battles ever. 
The character development is out of this world. Not once in a shounen i had a tough time picking 5 characters that i liked/loved.
Each character has a story, and that gives them depth to their personality.
It's a shame that HxH's author fell off the face of the earth, this anime was and still is a masterpiece that needs to

                I have started rewatching anime a several months ago , since a fairly long break ; since the good ol childhood days. Meanwhile scrolling through shows to watch i have discovered a nostalgia re-run vaguely obvious in front of me which was the reboot of the highly acclaimed Hunter X Hunter series , and got involved into it for the sake of reliving those innocent days in a new purely wrapped version which made me discover it even further because of the scale of events it covered in its source material manga.
The story as far as we notice is a formidable competently written piece of
                  literature that starts with the enormous world full of wonders and unique humans called HUNTERS , our main protagonist Gon is our viewpoint of the entirety of this world until he achieves his only goal in life which is to meet his father which is a Hunter who left Gon in his earlier days. 
However Gon's goal to meet his father is filled with adventures and thrills of different sorts meshed together in a very appealing manner along with the lovable mysterious characters along the road.
The main standouts of the story is the constant pace variation and intellectual potential of arc arrangement and the build up of events and characters , the show has acclaimed a high standard of mentality while dealing with events and battles that seem basic but truly has a deep reasonable eccentric credibility compared to any other shounen anime.
Ill sum up the art and sound in one go..
The sounds in HxH are completley vague and each character has his own Vibe and backround music that fits perfectly. And the idea of a constant Opening song with different animations is a true wonder that makes you attached to it and gives you sincere motivation of some sort.
The art is just Gorgeous and bright-fully colored compared to the original series which was darker.
Hunta X Hunta !! summed up is a action based comedic gray show that has no particular goal but focuses on the journey itself , mind me on this -- the show has no goal but the characters do or try to acclaim one atleast , which gives the show an enormous ambiguity and a fantastic potential to expand the story in all different directions and deviations due to the unexplored universe and hidden character potentials and the most intellectual 100+ shounen out there. Hit it up and you wont be dissapointed :)
P.S : Get well soon Togashi , we need more of this.
Thanks for reading this rushed review :P",9

                (Simple, to-the-point, anime review for Hunter X Hunter 2011 Subbed)
I feel like the most important aspect of anime is the enjoyment factor. Did I enjoy Hunter X Hunter? YES! My overall rating for this show is 10/10, but that does not mean it doesn't have flaws, because all shows have flaws. The pros of HXH completely overshadow the cons. I highly recommend this show.
Some answers questions about the show to see if it's a show you'd like to watch. 
Does the MC (Gon) make stupid decisions? Yes, but he often makes more good decisions than bad ones. Killua is the character you are looking for
                  if you like consistently smart and fast decision making. 
Did this series make me cry or tear up? It did not make me ball my eyes out, but it did make me tear up countless times. 
Are the main characters so strong that they never see defeat? Actually, the main characters are EXTREMELY weak and always are weak especially when in comparison to other characters. They often see defeat more than victory. 
Are there fillers? In my opinion, no. 
Are the villians actually good villians? Yes. HXH has the best, most likable villians I have ever seen in any anime, show, or move. 
Are the fights dragged out along many episodes? No. Fights can be from 1 second to 2 episodes tops. The show is more about the progression, interaction, and dialogue than the fights itself. 
Is this anime for kids that the first episodes shows? No. I would never recommend this show to a kid. There is murder, death, slight mentions of sex and masturbation, gambling, suicide, cannibalism, blackmail, and so much more. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
I have watched all 148 episodes 2 times in a 2 year span, and I still want to rewatch it all over again! There are low points, but there are so many high points. It's not a rollarcoaster ride, because the ride keeps going higher and higher even if there are one or two drops along the way. 
Characters [Hisoka and Killua make this show beyond enjoyable]: Character designs for the MCs and even side characters are pretty normal. Character back stories in general are above average. Voice acting is the best I have ever seen in an anime series. The person who plays Gon deserves many rewards! Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio are perfect together. Though we do not get to see much of Kurapika and Leorio compared to Gon and Killua, there is a pe factory good explanation why. This show is NOT your average shounen. It is not about ""friendship is power."" Leorio and Kurapika have their own lives (making them a separate item from the MC). You will see in so many shows where the MC meets new friends along the way and they will stick to the MC like glue until the end of the series. Leorio and Kurapika are friends with Gon, but they are not stupid to throw their lives away by sticking with a 12 y.o kid they just met. 
Music/Soundtrack/Sound/OP/ED [The best part of the show]: OP ""never"" changes. EDs do. The music is above average. I can listen to the whole soundtrack and never get bored. The OST for the third half of the show is where it truly shines. You can feel the emotion in every track. The music for HXH is my FAV part of the show. I believe good music ties a show together. This show with below average music would be a totally different show, BUT the music takes this anime to a whole new level. 
Story [Typical Adventure Story]:The story is about a young boy who wants to become a Hunter to find his father who is also a Hunter; that is the reason why he wants to become a Hunter in the first place. 2011 version has no fillers (in comparison to the 1999 version), in my opinion; EVERYTHING is shown for a reason. If something seems not important, trust me, it will be important later. THE SHOW IS NOT ABOUT THE DESTINATION, IT IS ABOUT THE SMALL DETOURS ALONG THE WAY. 
Animation/Art: The animation never dips below a certain point that makes it hard to watch; the animation only gets better especially in the fight scenes. I just wish they didn't censored the show. The censorship is disappointing. I make it sound like there is a lot of censorship; there really isn't, but I'd like none if possible. 
Do you want to see people eaten to death by fish? Check. 
Do you want to see heads chopped off and necks snapped? Check. 
Do you want to see broken body parts and cut off limbs? Check. 
Do you want to see a severed heart? Sorry, you won't get to see that here due to censorship... 
Overall: 10/10",10

1.0 - Why I think Hunter X Hunter is a masterpiece.
1.1 > I will start with some ""common criticism"".
A lot of people says that Greed Island is a bad and boring arc and thats the reason why HxH can't be a 10/10, etc. I somewhat agree with Greed Island being boring but I just think the situations were a bit unfortunate, Greed Island was placed between the two best arcs of the show (Chimera Ants and Yorknew) which both of them are easily a 9/10 and a 10/10, because of that this arc may feel underwhelming. The arc on itself isn't bad, but isn't
                  close of being the best arc.
Another common issue is the consistency and pacing of CA's arc. Personally, I was too immersed in the story to notice the pacing, afortunately I've watched HxH two times and withso I can say the pacing is slow but that doesn't makes it bad. For Argument's sake, the pacing helps to build the tension of the Castle Invasion, and set up the tense atmosphere. It also makes the final payoff inmmensely more satisfying and overall more enjoyable. In terms of consistency is to be expected, most Shonen anime are often inconsistent, but they still leave a large impact due to their peaks.
Finally, people saod that Chimera Ant carried HxH and without it, it wouldn't be good. Well, yes if you take a major plot point that the entirety of the series before it was building upto, you'd expect the show to worsen. I don't understand people who say this tbh.
> This is not your average shonen.
Hunter x Hunter had a very stereotypical Shonen beginning with the Hunter Exam Arc, a common Shonen trope (which I still found entertaining btw). It does a good job of showing innocence and simplicity, similar to Gon's character initially.
The sense of security from the innocent starter arcs are challenged by unsettung deaths, and the lack of acknowledgement of these deaths, and later outright genocides by the Phantom Troupe, nuclear radiation, suicide, and manslaughter. This sets HxH aside from the average shonen, as it builds up to the tragedy of the CA arc from the very beginning with dark undertones and themes of human pain, such as deaths in the exam arc, that can go unnoticed.
These themes are what I believe make the show a masterpiece. Everything sees so intricately woven from the start in order to build up to the climax of the anime. The darkness and tragedy of HxH is present from the very beginning of the series, but only becomes more clear as the show progresses,which in my opinion, makes the show so much better.
1.2 > Gon Freecss - Trauma?
While shonen protagonists are often care-free and easy going, Gon is different. Gon Freecss is a realistic example of an abandoned child, not knowing the difference between right and wrong as he had no parents growing up, who is thrown into a kill or be killed world where he had to get stronger in order to have any chance of meeting his father.
The harsh conditions he was presented obviously have taken a toll on his wellbeing, and his slow struggle to hide it shows through as we progress through the series, just as how the arcs become darker as we progress. Even from the beginning, Gon withstands torture stubbornly just to prove his worth in a cruel, unforgiving world.
Gon constantly struggles with self-worth, the ""trials"" his father presents him (metaphorically) makes him feel like he is not strong enough and would cause him to question wheter he is truly worthy of meeting his father. This constant feeling of a lack of self-worth would cause mental repercussions and we see the consequence of this in the CA arc, during Gon's rage at losing Kire, the only thing he had close to his father, Gon being able to express these emotions unlike other care-free shonen MC's is what really sets him apart for me, and he feels more human if anything.
1.3 > Chimera Ant - Darkness and Tragedy.
The CA arc presents a direct challenge to humanity, questioning us about our cruelty and showing us how merciless we are by making the humans the equivalent of animals to the chimera ants. It is a representation of humanity's selfishness to survive, that we disregard and destroy everything else. By putting humans to slaughter, CA highlights how strange, apathetic and unloving humans are.
I am sure that you have heard everything about ""Meruem becomes human"" and whatever, but what does that actually mean? By first showing us how lacking of love humans are, CA shows us how it is actually love and kindness that builds a human being, ie. Meruem becoming humane after Komugi's company. It shows how in order to become truly human we have to learn to love rather than step on everything for our selfish needs. These are the implications I have taken away from it and I think it's a beautiful message on what it means to be a human being.
And finally, one of the most iconic rage scenes in Animanga, the anger of Gon. As I said beforem the mental health repercussions Gon has as a consequence of events in his life are now openly shown in the form of pure power. Gon is willing to take the consequences of his actions as that is the price to pay and his resolve to take revenge (however immoral this may be) is unbreakable.
1.4 > Meruem - The king.
Upon being bon, Meruem murdered his mother. For him, everything resolved around power; you were either strong or you were controlled. He saw himself at the top of the food chain, the most powerful being, killed mercilessly and even cannibalised on ""unworthy ants. He fit the definition of an apathetic demon perfectly, viewing the weak as just a food source. He was astounded that rulers often come to be by bloodlines, deeply rooted in the belief that the strong should rule regardless.
There were two exceptions to this however: a blind female Gungi player, weak and vulnerable, yet gaining the respect of the King, and the Chairman of the Hunter Association, Isaac Netero, who was human but still gained the respect of Meruem. These two humans caused a change of heart in Meruem, proposing co-existence of humans and ants.
Despite being alive for only a few months, at the end of his life, Meruem was a man. He started off as a baby, naive and simple, and by gaining empathy, he became a man, learning to love humans and experience love himself. Meruem's character development is phenomental, and the depth he has through the CA arc is amazing, which solidifies him as my favourite antagonist of all time. Despite myself, I was able to sympathise with Meruem, a sign that Togashi did what he did right. Causing your audience to sympathise for an antagonist just shows how well written is this arc and character.
1.5 > This Day X and X this moment (HxH episode 135)
The relationship that Meruem and Komugi have is the purest form of love and is honestly very emotional and touching. Komugi being blind, has no way of judging Meruem for his appearance, so their love is solely from each other's company. The Chimera Ant arc tells a bittersweet story of love that is more evocative than many romance-tales.
Their relationship is the best example of ""love is blind"". Meruem saw all those under him as the same, so he didn't differentiate when it came to Komugi. Komugi cannot even see Meruem but possesses a strong devotion to him as a result of their matches and how kind he is to her, something she has not previously experienced.
Komugi helped Meruem to understand the beauty of humanity and that is the ability to accept one another and recognise the divine within each other, despite their differences.
The final scene that Meruem and Komugi share speaks volumes about how they feel. Komugi grieves at the fact Meruem is poisoned, but expresses a stained happiness when she finds out it is contagious, knowing that Meruem will not die alone, but Komugi with him, together. It is a depressing, painful scene yet powerful and sweet, and the strength of their relationship is shown.
""In the end, it was the blind girl who helped the God to see"".
1.6 > An unfinished masterpiece.
Hunter X Hunteris a touching tale about human depression and problems, a need to constantly be on top in a relentless world. It shows us that in order to be truly human, power, rank and hierarchy mean nothing, and it is compassion and the ability to take care for one another that makes us humane, and I think that is the main message that Togashi tries to convey throughout the series.
Hunter X Hunter also encapsulates suffering and pain, and the gives us a realistic, flawed, imperfect main character, which in my opinion, is perfect. Hunter X Hunter doesn't feint happiness and pleasantries like many other shonen, and this is what makes it a masterpiece.
""But HxH is not finished how can it be a masterpiece?""
Despite its infamous hiatus, Hunter X Hunter is still a masterpiece. It is just an unfinished one, and I am curious to se how Dark Continent lives up to CA, no matter how distant of a dream that is HxH, with its depth and intricately woven writting, left me with a moral and had a powerful impact on me and that is what makes it so good. I could go on and on about Hunter X Hunter, I just love it so much.
2.0 - Gon is one of the most under appreciated MC ever.
2.1 > The Disrespect
As of lately, I feel people are undervaluing the importance and incredible characterisation of Gon. Gon not only is barely getting any recognition from viewers as one of the best shounen mcs, but also he sometimes is seen as a downside of HxH. You may think ""oh no one disrespects Gon!"" That's just not true. I have seen people on almost all platforms calling Gon ""mid"", ""boring"", ""unimportant"", and some people say he is just a generic shounen mc. No, Gon isn't a generic MC and no, Gon isn't boring. Gon should be considered in the upper echelons of not just shounen mcs, but mcs in general.
2.2 > What makes him good.
Gon has some of the best characterization I have ever seen in a protagonist ever. He at first looks like the surface level shounen right? Well what if I told you that Gon is one of the most well created main characters in all animanga? He may not seem like he has that much depth to his cahracter, at first glance but if you look for the fdetails it is nearly impossible not to spot them. Gon is a character who since the beginning was selfish, ruthless, inconsistent. Let me explain how.
2.3 > True Personality.
Unlike your typical shounen protagonist such as Naruto or Ichigo. Gon isn't nearly as strong as the rest of the cast. Compared to Meruem and Netero, he is a mere weakling, a bug. In the Hunter Exam he knows how weak he is and thinks that he needs to push himself to be less dependent and become an afterimage of how people would consider strong. That's why he went so far to punch Hisoka, and he went so far to see Killua. Doing all of this is to prove his self worth and prove that he can see his father again. As all of this is happening gets clearer and clerarer that Gon is not going down a spiral like people think, but showing his true character. Yes, Gon is portrayed sometimes as a nice caring main character who is a bit childish. However, throughout the series it is shown that Gon has been inconsistent, ruthless, selfish and sometimes losing morality. Also, yes, Togashi has been consistent with his portrayal in every single arc. Notice how Gon would sometimes not care at all when people were dying in the Hunter exam, but also helping random people on the boat with their sea sickness. This is proof of his inconsistent behaviour. This all alluded to the all so famous Chimera Ant arc where his true personality shines.
2.4 > Chimera Ants Arc.
Gon's character climaxes in the beautiful arc that is called the Chimera Ant. So much happens in this arc and honestly in my eyes its the peak of shounen. Notice how during the Chimera Ant, Gon's nice and caring behaviour is no where to be found. He is willing to whatever it takes to complete his goal. Gon when killing the chimera ants felt zero mercy and sympathy. When he loses Kite who is a person who he really cares about, he loses his final sense of morality. From then on, Gon did everthing almost instinctively. Remember how I said that Gon was childish? 
Gon acting instinctively with a childish rage makes him act completely irrationally and threatening to kill Komugi. He no longer looked at Komugi as a living breathing human but a tool to use to get what he wants. He no longer sees human lives who aren't close to him as human. He has become a monster. The funniest thing is, this is the exact thing that he criticised back in the Yorknew City arc with the Phantom Troupe which is more proof of his inconsistent nature.
2.5 > The fight with Pitou.
Gon at first as we know acted out of instinct and a childish rage. He just lost someone important to him and is now no longer thinking about morality or about anyone else. At this point, Gon has already become a monster. He is using a human being as a kind of bargaining chip to get wath he wants. Once, Pitou says ""Gon, I'm sorry to say this but I must kill you for the King"". This makes Gon think that Kite will not be saved after all. This is the last string for Gon and he has completely embodied something that he dreaded, he hated. He embodied a monster, Gon proceeds to without mercy beat the living shit out of Pitou. The Gon who cared for people inconsistently for the time being was gone. The Gon who acts selfishly and forgot what morality is has taken over. Gon brutally urders Pitou without any hesitation. It ends with Gon's fist with blood stained all over it. However, Pitou's headless body still tries to attack him. At the last second Killua saves Gon and Gon ends up losing his arm. After the fight, he feels like he redemed Kite. But he sacrificed his humanity for it.
2.6 > Conclusion.
I didn't even cover all of Gon's character as I could have Gon in-depth with his dynamic with Meruem, his duo with Killua, and much more. However, based off what I have said alone, I feel as if though Gon isn't appreciated enough as a character. People are calling this guy ""mid"", ""boring"", ""trash"", when his true character even before the Chimera Ant was right before our eyes. Isn't if odd how people say that Killua would have been a better protagonist than Gon? Gon in the end is a child. Children's thought process in tough situations can lead to mental breakdowns and Gon is a prime example of that. One of my favourite examples of characterisation in all of anime.
Gon: 9.4/10
3.0 - Netero is a 10/10 character.
3.1 > His Past and Supposed Self
Before we even get into his character, it is pivotal to understand that Netero is a character who is situated to seem as if he seeks enlightenment. This is represented by 1) His long ears (in Buddhism, this represents the renunciation to the material world), and his extreme dedication to his prayer training.
His desire to be enlightened is shown even further by his nen manifestation, the Boddhisatva (translates to enlightened being)
Keep in mind that nen represents a user's personality in HxH, this is INCREDIBLY to understanding his character.
3.2 > Signs of Netero Displaying a Fake Persona
Here they are four cases that showcase Netero's blatant hypocrisy.
1) Him stopping Zeno from attacking Meruem behind the back, but he proceeds to win his battle against Meruem via a cheap shot (the bomb), and he always had the rose bomb up his sleeve, so he would have won anyways. This is deceptive, and against the Buddhism.
2) Netero claims renunciation from the material world, but he RUNS THE HUNTER ASSOCIATION. What Buddhist would run an association that leads to the deaths of many? What Buddhist that strives for God would run the most ""material world"" association?
3) His extremely egocentric/competitive was shown through him not letting Gon or Killua win the dodgeball game earlier on in the series. Why did he have to go so far against two preteens? What did he accomplish? It was nothing but an ego boost to him.
4) Him taking Meruem to an abandoned warzone location for their fight. In what initially seemed like his compassion towards his comrades, could be understood to be his desire to not let anybody know of his true, corrupt and unfair nature. It could very well be possible that he did not want to show his cheating nature (rose bomb) to humans.
Is Netero just a ""kind old man""? It is clear that Netero has a facade, and this became clear later on.
Fast forward to their fight, Netero says this: ""A prayer comes from the heart"".
Netero's belittling of people was foreshadowed all the way back in the Hunter exam, when he only used on leg and one arm to play dodgeball against Gon and Killua. As a man of Buddhism, it can be inferred that the arm and leg he lost was karma for his past wrongdoings. Netero's true self still has not been revealed yet though, he still seems as though he is fighting for humanity.
Netero's immaturity and aggression was also on full display during his fight with Meruem. Meruem opted for peace the entire fight. He said he had no intentions to fight, he only resorted to fight because Netero said he would tell Meruem his then unbeknownst name. Are these really the actions of a Buddhist, a religious person of peace and love? Why does he go so far to fight? He literally deprived Meruem of his identity, for his ego. That's a hate crime.
Netero's minimalistic ""harmless old man"" characterization early on in the series is so powerful because he isn't harmless until threatened. Take candy away from a baby and they will cry. Same logic here. Also, survival of the fittest. Netero was 110 years old before passing, him dying at the age and Meruem dying as a baby shows his desire to stay the apex predator, no matter the costs.
3.3> ""A prayer comes from the heart""
What if the heart if filled with malice? There is no ""good"" or ""bad"". as shown by this arc. Here, Netero stabs the vert heart that is his only connection to God. Without two hands, and only an arm left, Netero now has no way left to pray, aside from his heart. Why did he stab it? Why did he intentionally break his so-called connection to God? Because he had always valued nurture (human evolution) over nature (God's creation).
If is here that we see that Netero's prayers were never to serve God, but rather they were to serve himself. His last resort was not his Zero hand, his ultimate nen ability and his faith in God, but it was a human invention. His last resort was a bomb, meant to keep humanity alive, and destroy God's nature (chimera ants, the superior species). 
Also, another detail. Buddhists commonly shave their heads (it is called tonsure) as a renunciation to their worldly desires and the material world. Before travelling to NGL, Netero only cut a little bit, not all of it. He kept a portion of his ego, just in case (shown by him not revealing the Rose bomb until his nen was defeated). 
The poison being directly attached to his heart also puts into perspective how his “prayer from the heart” was tainted. And its crazier because it was tainted by humanity. Humanity made the poison and this “human desires” caused him to reglect his god. Again, Togashi is a sensational writer.
3.4 > Dynamic with Meruem
In Buddhism, after you die, there are two possible realities for you:
This depends on your karma. If you have a heart full of hatred, you will end up being reincarnated. If your heart becomes light and your attachment to the material world is nothing, you will become free from reincarnation, and you will become enlightened.
1) Samsara (the cycle of death and rebirth)
2) Moksha (liberation from this cycle of death and rebirth, becoming pure light)
Netero's attachment to the world was greater than his attachment to God (consciousness), so he will inevitably be reincarnated. He died in hate. He will be reincarnated, and he will once participate in the cycle of hatred.
Meruem, after being reborn (through Pouf and Youpi), had no attachment to the outside world. His last wish was to spend his last moments with a fragile blind girl. He died in love. He is now free, and he will remain as a light body forever.
3.5 > His True Colors
""If there is a hell, I'll see you there"".
The line that reveals it all, and it recontextualizes his entire character. Netero ever believed in God. It was all a facade, as shown by his weak faith here (""IF there is a hell"") Why would he say if? Wouldn't someone that dedicated his life to enlightenment indubitably believe in God's word? Netero saying ""I'll see you in hell"" implies that he knows he is a bad person. Why else would he say that? What other bad things did he do?
Even for Netero to attack with the Bodhisattva, he MUST pray. This line reveals that all his actions before were a lie. He had lied to himself that he was a man of God so many times that it became part of his personality (shown by his Nen manifestation, the Boddhisatva). But when his life was on the line, he showed his true colors, and he remembered his atheistic, egotistic nature (there is no nen ability shown here, just him). His nen ability also makes the aura around him gold, while his true aura (reference to the image with the quote in the top) is filled with dark bloodlust.
Netero’s laugh at the end is essentially him laughing at Meruem (which translates to “the light that illuminates all”) and embracing his ego. He has no intention of hiding it, he full embraces it, and rejects God completely, even though he is breaths away from dying, wow. (Also, the anglicized name Isaac means “He laughs/will laugh.”)
This line completely recontextualizes his ""a prayer comes from the heart"" line, as what he said was true, but his prayer was never one of love, but rather, it was out of hatred.
3.6 > Breaking news: Hunter association chairmen dies in valiant effort against the Chimera Ant King""
And finally, the rose bomb. The perfect conclusion to a perfect character. The rose bomb not only represents Netero, but it also represents humanity as a whole, when threatened. With no context, outsiders from far away will look at his rose and say, ""look at that beautiful rose"". But with context, the true nature of it is harrowing. Would they have the same reaction if they were told that this rose could have killed many people? 
If you see an image of the bomb, you will notice the thorns on the rose bomb. Even though roses are beautiful, if you touch the thorns, it will hurt you. Similarly, the happy, old, Netero, will do nothing to you if you do not do anything to threaten his place in society. But the moment you decide to take something away from him, he will kill you. And he will make it look beautiful, too, and get sympathy from the outside world. As that is the nature of humanity.
Netero is just an allegory to the self-deceptive, manipulative, egotistic human that strives for power. This isn't limited to anthropocentrism, it also applies to capitalism, and any other thing that makes you climb up the ladder. Netero will live though the parasitic human race, until he gets reincarnated, and does this all over again.
3.6 > Conclusion
Netero's decision to kill Meruem is essentially him ridding the world's opportunity of a utopia. He chose his own individuality instead of following orders from a Chimera Ant. The cost was world peace, but what's more important, world peace, or self-preservation? If I were to ask you right now if you would die to save seven billion lives, would you do it? Humanity's strive for individuation is their greatest strength, and also, their greatest weakness. The only thing that really connects humans together is our collective desire to live, but not out of concerns for others, but rather, out of concerns for ourselves. The reason humanity will never obtain world peace is because of ego, yet that very ego is our reason to live, as who are we if we don't have an identity?
Survival of the fittest, but not in evolution, but rather, in ego. The bigger ego wins. Through our own collective selfishness, we are forever united. That is the true nature of humanity in a nutshell.
One of the best dichotomies ever: Netero 10/10
HxH right now has two 10/10 for me, looking forward into an analysis of Chrollo and with that the third 10/10.",10
"
                Soooo, what're my thought about Hunter x Hunter? (spoiler-free)
The whole beauty of Hunter x Hunter is that it truly develops a world that isn’t just centered around the main protagonist and can be random and unforgiving which makes it way more immersive and interesting then just learning about a world based on where the hero decides to go and do. The world of Hunter x Hunter is developed enough that it doesn’t rely on its main characters in order to make sense, Gon is merely another person in this world and can’t just go and do whatever he wants being super OP, shown by the
                  numerous characters seen even early on that are vastly more powerful than he is. 
Another complaint was that the author and everyone in Hunter x Hunter were obsessed with Gon. While it’s certainly true that Gon is a huge part of the show and the most important character. 
There will always be a main character that receives more attention in any story and Hunter x Hunter actually does a much better job of this then most other shows where Gon isn’t Overpowered as explained above, and he isn’t even the main focus of multiple arcs like the Yorknew City Arc just straight up made Kurapika the main protagonist which very few other shounen are able to do since they rely solely on the journey of their one main hero UNLIKE Hunter x Hunter.
The animation and music corresponds so incredibly well with the environment of the beautiful world of Hunter x Hunter. There's not a single dull moment where you feel the animation lacks in quality nor production. 
The voice acting is incredible and presents each characters well. While the OST and music in the openings and ending gives an amazing impact after every arc. You will look back and find something new and learn throughout every episode. 
Objectively this is arguably one of my favorite Anime. I absolutely adore this show and every single character within it. There was never a dull moment and each episodes gave me that adrenaline to keep on watching and wanting to find out what'll happen next.",9
"
                In a world with magic, steampunk, and select modern technology, twelve-year-old Gon and his friends are determined to achieve various goals by becoming Hunters, for which they need to pass the fiendishly difficult and incredibly dangerous Hunter Exam.
This series is compulsively watchable and addicting, even at its length of 148 episodes, and it’s all in the characters: the idealistic but practical Gon, the wryly playful Killua, the scholarly and thoughtful Kurapika, and the impetuous Leorio. Side characters are given similar consideration and depth, like Hisoka the creepy “Joker” character and a ton of other “enemy” characters (like the Phantom Troupe, other Hunters, and even the
                  Chimera Ants). Just finding out about characters’ specialized fighting abilities (through a power called “Nen”) is totally fascinating.
At first, you think this is a really happy series, full of fun and silly things where fights are easily won without any sacrifice on the protagonist’s part. And then little by little, some really seriously dark material starts to creep in, and you see how messed up this anime can get, with torture, murder, hypnotism, child abuse, insanity, imprisonment, genocide, and gladiatorial fights to the death. The art lulls you into a false sense of security that hides the dark themes to come.
However, the dark events are a double-edge sword for this anime, and my main complaint is that the anime does not treat the often devastating collateral damage to civilians or bystanders with as much gravitas and angst as it treats damage to the heroes and their loved ones. I never thought I’d be requesting characters to feel more overwhelming angst or guilt in my entertainment, but parts of this anime feel so strangely unreal without it. As I said before, the anime is chock-full of random acts of shocking violence, but they are only occasionally treated as such by any of the main characters.
Minor unnamed characters are constantly dying or being tortured in horrific ways. In one scene, an extra suddenly and without warning becomes a double-amputee for a minor infraction (he bumped against someone without apologizing), and not only is he never seen from again, none of the other characters present do anything more than basically shrug blithely and go back to their conversation. I found myself wondering, “Did that just happen?!”
I would compare this anime’s world-building to Fullmetal Alchemist, but I find it impossible to imagine FMA’s characters dealing with something like that in such a bland way—if Ed Elric saw an event like that, he’d be shocked to the core and angsting about it for months! So while Hunter x Hunter has the potential to really explore the depths of the human psyche, it too often squanders great opportunities in favor of simply moving the plot along.
That said, even with the darkness, the anime does have plenty of heart, with its main theme being the power of friendship and determination. Beware: the first few episodes are not great, so definitely give this one time to get going. Because it will. By the end of the last arc, I was stunned at the incredible journey I had just taken with these characters.",8
"
                ""HxH has to be one of the most overrated shonen anime out there if I've ever seen it , there are many reasons as to why I rated this show the way I did and soon you'll find out why.
Firstly , I cannot forgive the god-awful character designs in this show , these ugly characters are the reason as to why Itachi went blind . I mean how do they expect us to take this show seriously with these awful designs , It was also one of the main reasons I hated the Chimera Ant Arc because it allowed Togashi to roam free with his
                  ugly ass seizure-induced drawing.
Another thing is the art style , I found the 1999 version to be more mature , whereas the 2011 adaptation looks cutesy and childish for my taste , another reason I can't take it seriously.
The only good , enjoyable and watchable arc is the Yorknew City Arc , all the other arcs are ass
Gon's abilities are also boring , predictable and lack any sort of possible development
""This anime has no good characters, they all suck ass""
Feitan and Machi are also the only good phantom troupe members , the rest are boring and lack and depth. I mean even the cut from the blade Kurapika put on Uvogin's heart had more depth than them
The Hunter Exam Arc is a boring and bootleg version of the Chuunin Exams ,and I'm not the only one who agrees with that , there is plot convenience all over the goddamn place , how can a Fat shit like Tonpa and a skinny shit like Leorio run 80+ km it makes no goddamn sense.The only good thing to look forward to in this arc is Killua and Hisoka
When Gon and gang went to save Killua , I was interested because I thought something interesting was gonna go down but no , Togashi just pulls conveniences out of his ass left and right , I was facepalming every episode , so much so that my face has my full hand-print . You mean to tell me that a 12 year old kid with a broken arm , which magically got healed thanks to the power of plot , a 17 year old and lanky malnourished boy in a suit managed to individually put 1209 kg worth of force into opening the door they were struggling to carry a 20kg cup. If you ask me , PLOTTTT!!!!. The soundtrack in this arc made by ears burn and there was also absolutely no suspense , I mean I had a higher chance of finding Gon's hairline , than I did of finding any suspense in this arc.
The Heavens Arena Arc also sucked ass because there is no balance between whether this is a training arc or tournament arc . The idea for heaven's arena was alright but it turned shit , As expected. Now , the only thing AND I MEAN THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT THIS ARC was Hisoka and his fight with Kastro , they truely displayed the power and potential of , they should've also gotten rid of those 3 nen users Gon and Killua were fighting.
The OST's are decent , especially Hisoka's and Kurapika's (Kusari Yarou)
The Greed Island Arc has to be the most sleep-inducing arc , I had to take meth , coffee and adderall to stay awake , It cured my brother of insomnia , he watched 1 episode and he was dozing off. If it hadn't been for the dodgeball game I probably would've dropped the arc there , it is completely pointless even Gon said it himself , the card-gathering moment was extremely unbearable to watch especially since it served no purpose at the end. The bomber is also the worst written villain and he also should've killed Gon but no Gon was saved by OH WAIT , ITS A BIRD , ITS A PLANE , NO , It was the god awful plot convenience from the unexplained cards
Now , Onto the most overrated arc ever , The Chimera Ant Arc (CAA)
The CAA has to be the most overrated arc ever to be made , the only good thing about this arc was killua and feitan , this arc was also incredibly dragged out it probably could've only been 30 episodes had they not put money first
The idea of Chimera Ants also makes no sense , since they're suppose to hold more than 2 different genes but none of them look even remotely like ants and they somehow in an isolated nation happen to have so much resources and it also makes no sense how the latter generation (Pitou , Youpi , Meruem and Pouf) were so strong compared to the previous generation (Welfin , Meleoron etc) when there was nothing that happened inbetween their births to contribute their increase in power , people use eating Pokkle as an excuse but when Pitou was born Pokkle was alive
This arc tries so hard to be dark and mature but fails in every way , Gon's transformation against Pitou was an asspull and also made no sense as he only knew Kite for 2 weeks yet he was crying like a bitch and we were all supposed to like that hell no.
Netero vs Meruem was also a bad fight , it was just Netero slapping Meruem and Meruem getting back up and talking about some Gungi bullshit yet people suck off this arc. The narrator is especially annoying I mean that guy had more lines than the actual fucking VA's
Meruem is also the worst villain , he has no personality , he is just the cliche ""I want to rule the world for the sake of it"" villain , he also has no special techniques and he is incredibly strong which made no sense and in the end he became good guy , yep like that has not been done before.
Now , I actually liked Nen as a power system because it was really balanced . but then Alluka shows up and the word 'balanced' is thrown out of the window , Alluka is a living deus ex machina that can grant any wish but somehow wasn't used in the CAA because Killua doesn't want to abuse her which is completely contradictory.
This show also has the worst reunion if I've ever seen it , Ging just shows up in front Gon , which is annoying because what purpose do the previous arcs serve.
Overall : If you want a better show , check out Berserk , Dororo or Yu Yu Hakusho , they're all way better""",1
"
                ""Knuckles hesitated to say anything because it could result in death""  is by far one of my favorite narrations form this anime.
At first I was dissuaded by its childish-like appearance but then I watched it
!!!! 
I haven't enjoyed an anime like this in a long time.  
It's from the same YuYuHakasho but the swift development of plot and  characters is a 100% improvement. The fast paced fights and adventure are truly a spectacle and joy to watch. It's a must watch.  A staple in the anime diet. Definitely a must watch!

                Sorry for my bad english
1. Meruem - ""best antagonist in the word"" just edgy copy of Buu from Dragon Ball Z. Buu=Meruem, Satan=Komugi except Satan is a prescribed character and Komugi just plot device.
2. Alluka is just a slap in the face of the audience in an ""ingeniously written"" work, after which Togashi wipes your face with a handkerchief, saying that he fulfills desires only for a great price, like the life of the person who wants. And now your face seems to be cleaned, but Togashi immediately spits at him because this time he will grant the wish just like that. 
3. This applies
                  more to fans who go everywhere and talk about the current that there are no villains in Hunter. According to these people, the gang that slaughtered an entire clan or killed people at an auction for the sake of money are not villains. After all, HxH is so deep and adult in their head, it's a pity that not in reality.
4. Most of the characters do not have a single dialogue except how to explain something. Great writing btw.
5. Logical holes in the world. As an example, we have a group that will do anything for the sake of money, but right in front of these Togashi presents us with an arch in which our main characters, twelve years old, have become millionaires in the arena in a month.
6. The main characters of the genius are chosen one in a million, which is said right in the anime.",3
"
                HxH 2011 is truly a top-tier anime. So far, out of any other anime, it is literally the best one I've watched. Period.
Story: 10/10
It may be tough for newcomers to get interested in HxH starting from episode one, simply because it begins somewhat childish. The anime starts off very ""happy happy"" and takes quite a bit for it to get dark and violent, which is what most anime fans wanna see. If you're patient enough, you'll begin to see things change. From Killua killing people left and right and Gon getting his ass kicked left and right, that's when the story picks up. HxH produces
                  and amazing plot with many shocking twists, leaving it unpredictable and flat-out entertaining. Probably my favorite arc in the entire series is the Phantom Troupe arc. The villains were incredibly lovable and I loved Kurapika's role in the arc. The ending to the arc is insanely mind-blowing.
Character: 10/10
Another strong point that HxH has is its cast of characters. From primary to secondary, there is literally not a single bland character in the entire series. You can hate a character, but the fact that all of the characters are so well-done, you can't help but like them at least a little bit. The main protagonist, Gon Freecss, is a very unlikely underaged hero, who's powerful, but naiive, hot-tempered, and very simple-minded. His personality is rather realistic, especially for a kid, as he's well-known to have his emotions get the best of him whenever an innocent is harmed. His best friend and probably the most popular character next to Hisoka, is Killua, an undeniably badass and intellectual 14-year-old. His friendship with Gon is incredibly deep. Killua's determination in protecting and controlling Gon shows that he can be somewhat a father figure to Gon. Gon and Killua drive most of the story, but the show would be nothing without the other characters such as Kurapika, Leorio, Hisoka, the Phantom Troupe, and pretty much anyone else in HxH. You'll love every character, or you may even hate them but what's important is whether the characters give you any opinions at all. The diversity of the characters is rather amusing as well. I love how the developers of HxH were creative with different designs, making some characters generic human beings, to making others incredibly imaginative, silly, or even wacky ""beings"".
Art: 8/10
It won't win any awards, but the animation of HxH is still pleasing to the eye, as all new anime should be anyways. I do enjoy watching the detail the animators put in action sequences, such as the impact of a punch or the exploding aura from a Nen ability, which are all like Hajime no Ippo style.
Sound: 7/10
Another aspect of HxH that won't win any prizes, since 90% of the background music is just reused, but I did find some tracks to be rather interesting such as some of the hybrid action music or epic orchestral songs. Some other songs are more One-Piece-type heroic or ""we did it"" music, which really isn't my taste.
Enjoyment: 10/10
I love the hell out of HxH 2011, simply because of its incredibly maintained plot and amazing character development. Screw Naruto, Bleach, DBZ (not showing hate towards fans. I used to watch a bit of DBZ and Naruto myself) or any of that other overpowered shounen crap; you simply cannot call yourself an anime fan without seeing this.",10
"
                People chose kyoani and shaft for being different, mappa and A1 for giving bangers,but no animated studio can achieve what MADHOUSE has achieved through the century. From unappreciated gems(Blue Literature, Barefoot Gen,Takarajima etc) to popular masterpieces(Monster, Parasite, Perfect Blue etc) and still giving us good shows. The remake version of hxh is no different. There are tons of reviews about this, but idc. I love this anime and decided to make a short & simple review. So I am gonna basically explain the 6 major arcs. 
1.Hunter Exam arc:Tbh, I prefer the older  version of this arc.(including fillers, ep 1-31)The older version was more
                  creepy, weird and darker. The exams was so difficult that you will get shivers thorough your veins. The new one basically picnic with friends.Fav character:Rookie crusher Tonpa.
8/10
2.Heaven's Arena arc:The first obvious thing setting Hunter x Hunter apart is its magic system, the Nen System. Although we see Nen foreshadowed in Hunter x Hunter's first few arcs(including the minor arc called Zoldyac Family arc), we don't get a larger explanation about its existence until the Heaven's Arena Arc when Wing teaches Killua and Gon about aura and it's different classifications. The Nen System has a lot of detail and thought put into it, starting with the difference in the techniques a Nen user can utilize and the different Nen classifications that a person would fall under. Any character in Hunter x Hunter with an understanding of Nen could use Zetsu to hide their presence, but if say, you wanted to make a Double of yourself with Nen like Kastro, you'd need to train yourself in Conjuration and Manipulation.What makes a technique fall into a specific category may seem simple at first, but it's in how Togashi approaches this system that makes it's interesting. Take an Enhancer-type character like Palm. Enhancers are able to increase their natural abilities like strength and speed; how Palm does it with her ""Black Widow"" technique to completely wrap her hair around her body like a suit of armor. This gives her an impervious defense but also makes her attacks stronger and heavier.Characters like Hisoka fall under the Transmutter category, able to change the properties of their Nen. His main ability, Bungee Gum, gives his Nen the elasticity of rubber and the adhesiveness of gum. This sounds simple at first, but becomes so adaptive in combat. One such example is his fight against the coin sharpshooter, Gotoh. Hisoka was not only able to catch the coins using his Nen but able to return them back to Gotoh with equal force using his Bungee Gum.Fav character:Horny Hisoka the pedo. 7.5/10
3.Yorknew City Arc:The most entertaining arc in the series. The Phantom troup is the best group of villains after Akatsuki imo.At first glance, they appear like any intimidating group of vile villains, but once we spend some time with them we get a sense of camaraderie among them. They joke around and share kindred respect for one another. A moment that will always speak to the Phantom Troupe's cheerful but cold aura is in during Uvogin's fight against The Shadow Beasts. When Uvogin steps up to fight the mafia while outnumbered, none of the Phantom Troupe step in to lend a hand, as they're very familiar with Uvogin's strength. Instead, they decide to sit around to play cards and enjoy themselves, even once the Shadow Beasts arrive.Fav character :Uvogin. 
9.5/10
4.Greed Island arc:Gon went to a virtual world looking for his father with his friends.Teaming up With Hisoka is the best moment in this arc.The psychological battles are really cool and unique here.Fav character:Naked Hisoka with hair down. 
8.5/10
5.Chimera Ant Arc: It has extremely slow pacing(So, just increase the playback speed XD).It had to be slow paced for the incredible build up followed by excellent payoff along with amazing thematic storytelling with steller characterization. One of the main reasons I love this arc cause the most terrifying character wasn't the king, it was the mc after all. That's the reason u never fck around with what he cares the most. 1st half of the arc shows human sufferings, 2nd half shows how heartless and brutal humans can be to maintain the top position of the food chain and we see why we are even the first place. Just imagine humans has lost the top position. The top holder can massacre us like how we do to the ants.""Do You Humans Ever Listen To The Cries Of Mercy Coming From The Pigs And Cows You Slaughter? "" still gets me.In the last half,The oldest hunter v/s the King of chimera ants is one of the finest fights I've ever witnessed. And the way this arc ended is sad, soul-crushing and beautiful at the same time.This arc also has drama which is extremely rare in any shounen arcs. I thank TOGASHI(get well soon) and the entire production team of Madhouse(pls don't die)for giving us this masterpiece. Thus the best Shounen arc ever created in the history of anime & this is a FACT.If you don't agree, that's your personal opinion against the fact.Fav character:Komugi. 
10/10
6.Election arc:Shittiest arc. Fck it. Gon's dad(what an asshole)makes Batman father of the century. Gon finally meets his father. The end. Fav character:Leorio.

                ""Dude, don't let the cute look of the anime deceive you it is a dark anime it's the ultimate shit, you gotta see it""
well my friend was right partially, it is the ultimate shit
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS
Story:
The first episode is simply garbage it starts off really bad, there is nothing interesting to pay attention to, you have to wait until episode 4 till the story start
so it starts, our Protagonist is in a ""Hunter Exam"" because...wait why is he taking this extremely dangerous Exam again?...oh i remembered because his father who abandoned him when he was 1 month old took the same exam, right
                  off the bat you can see the nonsense
why take the exam? this is a legal Exam so he could have just asked about him, also why is he interested in his asshole of a father? his father literally left him for his own sake it's disgusting and i can't believe 'Gon' (our main Protagonist) wants to see him
But this is the tip of the iceberg, the real question is why the hell this exam is legal and what is the benefit of taking it? it is not explained why this is a legal process but we learn what is the benefit of taking it from a gay pedophile clown (Hisoka), he says he is taking it because you gain license of a hunter which makes it easier for you to get away with murder, just think about how stupid it is to legalize this
The Main Main plot is"" Where Is My Daddy"" but we get a lot of subplot in the middle of it, there is a Arc where the plot became about mutant evil ants! taking over the city while that arc had the best moments in the anime it was filled with a lot of trash characters, i mean for god's sake who the fuck was that Octopus? he ruined every time the anime wanted to get serious.
the only time i wasn't repulsed by anything in this anime was when ""the king"" and that Grand Master Girl were playing that game, the King is the best character of this anime, in fact he is so good of a character that he shouldn't have been in this anime, he is the only character who shows real growth, it's sad because we don't see a lot of him in this anime but it's also cheerful because he doesn't have to be in this awful anime for too long
If we take a close look at the characters we can see that a lot of the main characters just lose their original purpose, for example what happened to Kurapika? didn't he swear to kill the spiders? he just fucked with them a little but nothing happened, you might be saying well he changed and he isn't seeking revenge anymore but he never says this, he had a lot of chances to killed them all but he didn't
another example is Chrollo and Hisoka, what happened?! i mean come on we've been waiting for them to finally fuck each other in the ass, but nothing happens, he is just gone, it is said that he  will come back but he never does, which is nonsense, he is one of the main characters and we don't see what happens to him? why hisoka stopped caring?
BTW it is kinda a plot hole that people can still hide their presence when ""En"" exist
Characters:
-Gon:
When it comes to will power (Naruto*100) and when it comes to courage (Kirito*100)
this motherfucker is the ultimate will power, break every single damn bone in his body but it's still useless, a trained ninja who specializes in torture couldn't make this guy sweat
he is so optimistic, kill his friends and he'll be like: ""i'm gonna bring them back to life""
OH did i forget to mention he is a total dipshit?
AND ALSO did i forgot to mention hidden power?
-Kurapika:
Kurapika is the honor boy, if you want to summon him just say honor and he will be there!, his entire clan is wiped out kinda like sasuke from Naruto.
anyway he is an annoying brat, and it was so fucking cheesy every time he got angry over other people saying ""spider"", the real problem is we never see his clan, we are just told he is angry MKAY
He is the most garbage character here
-Killua:
This character is full of contradiction and his development is destroyed by bad choices, at some points he is the strongest character in this anime and in others he is the weakest, he is disgusted that when faced with super strong opponent he wants to run away!! the poor kid is trying to learn from the dumbest character in the show, why nobody tells him he is the one who got it right? his teacher actually calls this 12 year old a total loser because he runs away from a fight which he couldn't possibly win
but guess what it wasn't a psychological ""problem"" his evil brother was the one behind this, his evil brother had put a needle in Killua's brain to make him fear and Killua finds out about this out of thin air and after it's removal from his brain by bare hand! he is now ready to fight anyone, this isn't development, this is cheating
-Leorio:
BBAKA I'M BETTER THAN YOU, BAAKKKA 
if you like a character who can't control himself for a second and yelling is his normal way of speaking then he is your guy
Sound:
Look i don't wanna be an asshole here and keep shiting over this anime in every aspect but am i the only one who was like :  oh we are about to have a fight here are they going to play the same soundtrack agai... yep they are!
soundtracks are good but there is a lack of them, it's not cool to keep playing the same soundtrack over and over and over again
Art:
It's complete trash, just kidding it's great it's actually great
Enjoyment:
The moments where ""the king"" and his subordinates exist: 10/10
other moments: 0/10",4

                This show gets all the fluff right and not much of the substance. It has consistently great visuals and sound, but outside of that it's just...meh. 
The main character, Gon, is fairly inconsistent, going from a fairly decent shounen protagonist, who while he is the ""not super smart adventurous type"" is a refreshing spin on the archetype because he doesn't solely believe in his own ideals. But then suddenly he meets one guy who knew his dad and spent a couple days with him, and goes utterly insane when this person is attacked. Killua, the other main character, offers an interesting foil and really the
                  highlight of the show is the friendship these two form, but even that ends up getting sappy in odd ways. Beyond those two, none of the characters really last. A number of characters get introduced in the first twenty episodes who barely, if at all, appear later. Basically most of them pop in and out of the story fairly regularly, even two of the characters on the shows promo image. Each of them is given varying amounts of depth but few really stand out as interesting characters, much less ones who actually make the show entertaining to watch.
1/3 of the show is spent in arguably the worst arc, the Chimera Ant arc, which utterly ruins my suspension of disbelief in all manner of convoluted ways, even more so than the Greed Island arc. The story writing in this show can just be all over the place sometimes leaving me tilting my head in bewilderment and going ""That's not how it works, darn it."" or ""That's just silly"". And the last 14 episodes feature a deus ex machina if I've ever seen one.
But the most egregious offense this show commits is how little the main duo actually have fights or exchanges that really use their abilities. You don't find out what they even are until over 1/3 of the way through the show and the amount they actually use them is staggeringly low. I get that it's not trying to be the most action packed shounen anime out there, but in 148 episodes the main character only has a handful of actual fights, sometimes going entire arcs without any action, and most of the early ones just involve him getting utterly thrashed. The remainder of the show is, by and large, training segments. The entire show titillates you  into thinking these characters are going to grow as Nen users but most of the show is training, training, training. I get that the series isn't complete, but there is no excuse for 148 episodes and such little payoff. Their work doesn't amount to much at all, and it leaves me, as a viewer, with a very incomplete feeling. It just doesn't pay off to watch this show.
It's a decent enough show and premise, but it could be so, so very much more, both in entertainment and in actual substance.",5

                Hunter X Hunter has always been a favorite anime of mine. Ever since it used to air the old series on TV, I used to watch it every day after coming back home from school. I would never have imagined that a series like this could ever need a reboot and that it could actually surpass it. The quality of the anime is way better than the original series, but as far as character designs go, I have to say I  prefer the older version compared to this one.
I actually dropped this a couple of years ago as it was airing and I recently
                  decided to pick it up again.
Story - The story is pretty interesting. Sometimes it can be light-hearted and cheerful, and sometimes it can get pretty dark and tragic. Characters die in this anime. Gon wants to become a hunter and finally meet his dad, sounds pretty simple right? Well it isn't really as one has to put his life on the line to become a hunter and even after becoming one. That might sound very interesting, but the most interesting aspect I found in this anime is actually in other characters like Kurapika. The best arc for me was definitely the Phantom Troupe arc, and I feel it was kinda short-lived compared to the long Chimera Ants arc. What bothers me is that despite the anime is over, the story is not. There are a lot more things that have yet to be explored and resolved, which the anime leaves open. Sometimes I felt like there isn't much action going on an a lot of dialogue and narration especially during the Chimera Ants arc. The narration kept going on for a good 4-5 episodes without much happening, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the episodes. 
Characters / Art - Gon isn't a bad main character, but I felt he is over-shadowed by other superior characters, like Kurapika, Hisoka and Killua. My favorite character was definitely Kurapika as I said even his arc stood out more than the other arcs for me. Revenge is always an interesting subject, and even his past intrigues me. I also like how Gon and Killua don't end up being the strongest characters in the series like most other shounen anime after an arc or two. There are actually a lot stronger characters in the series, way beyond their level sometimes. As for the quality of the animation and character desgins, I think the quality is top-notch and very smooth animation, but as character desgins go, I prefer the older version because I think they are more ""mature-looking"" and fits more with the series. It might also be my nostalgia goggles talking here, but that's the way I feel.
Overall - I enjoyed the series, I would recommend it not to just any specific anime fan, but to all anime fans. It's not perfect by far, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's definitely worth a try. I would definitely like to see more of this, but we might have to wait a little while because of the constant hiatus regarding the original creator of Hunter X Hunter. I might try reading the manga where the anime left off sometime in the future.",8
"
                I started watching this anime after the encouragement of two of my friends. I took my time and finished it under 2 weeks. That happened a month ago and I developed ideas about anime, the good ones and the bad ones, then decided to write a review about it. Lemme say it right away, it is a good anime. Why not great? It kind of feels like a wavy sea, with ups and downs. HxH is filled with lots of anime clichés, like holy sh*t! 
	PS. This is not a spoiler-free review. If you are a fan of the series, it won’t be a problem
                  for you. Also, if you are a fan and want to hate me, you are welcome to read the review. Because I’ll do an arc-by-arc review and it’ll be quite critical about it.
It starts introducing the main characters and the setting and defining the word “hunter”. My biggest problem with the anime is the first three arcs. You see, when I watch something, I’m willing see something new. I’m dying for it! And with the first arcs nothing new was brought on the table. It’s all about training and competing with people… then training again. Hear me, the ones who watched know that they are going to train in almost every arc. Why put 30 episodes of training? You could’ve ended it with 10 episodes or something. It’s not like training is something ground-breaking new thing in anime. We’ve seen it in lots of other animes. It’s already a used technique and something that became a cliché long time ago. Why return to it? Taking the idea of training and raping our minds with it did not please me much. We want to see something new! Show us something like Hisoka vs Gon duel in Heavens Arena arc. That fight was the turning point for me. I’m not into mindless action but that scene was so intense and well made. However, sadly we don’t get this kind of action really much in HxH. Mostly are slow fights that blended with fighters’ thoughts and plans. Again something that we have seen before. It is an action scene right? So act, don’t talk. I almost gave it up somewhere between episodes 15-20, because it was slow, but… well my patience paid it off.  First arc 6/10. Second arc 7/10. Third arc… 7.5/10
Yes, as you see it got better for me and the fourth arc was the pest part of the whole anime. I realised that those 30 something episodes were a build-up (an alright one) to this. This arc was badass, mysterious overall awesome. Introduction of new characters and the relation of the characters we already knew with them was excellent. Kurapika was awesome. At first Kurapika’s story was kind of bland just like the character itself, but when Kurapika acted, I realised that he was not kidding. His technique was also really interesting. I did not care much about any other character that was doing unrelated things meanwhile Kurapika and her team was clashing with Phantom Troupe. Whatever Gon and Killua did prior the reunion with Kurapika was not that interesting. The arc had a set of awesome characters, lots of new some returned, great story of double-sided revenge, PT song (hack yeah!), good action scenes and twists and turns. I’ll go high, Fourth act 9.5/10
Greed Island arc had lots of… TRAININGS! Nice exactly what I was looking for. It also had a mindless (and intelligent), motiveless villain. The twist about the Greed Island’s existence was quite nice. They could’ve added something to villain’s personality about that twist. But no, we like villains with no motives, right? Gon’s motive was to find his father, Killua’s motive was to help gon. Even the old guy who sent other hunter team into the game had his own motives. Let me give you an example. Digimon season 2, first villain we meet, a kid who loved clashing digital monsters with each other and keeping them in prison cells. A total douche. When he realised that Digital world is not a computer game he went almost mad and redeemed himself becoming a good guy. Yes, Greed Island was actually a real landscape, with real human players. I was expecting a twist in villain’s personality, but no, did not happen. Other than that I did not really have any problems with this arc. Troupe’s return was good, the ball throwing game was good. Lots of good stuff, however villain was a total let-down. 7.5/10
Probably the most talked arc in the whole anime, Chimera Ant Arc. Interesting new characters, great build up, excellent motives to both sides, heroes and villains, and a… a narrator that almost ruined everything. Nice, we have a superb first and second act with interesting characters like Kite, Knuckles, the pipe dude (he was badass), smoking guy and the other side, King, Pouf, Yupi and that b*tch Pito. Hey look they even added some cool characters like Ikalgo and the chameleon guy. Now that’s a real build up. How’s gonna be our pay off? How? Good? Kind of… If narrator was not narrating another 20 episodes. If those 20 episodes could’ve ended with 5 episodes instead. It was a lazy decision to add some stupid narrator. I’m not against narrating the story, but explaining things that are clear as a flash light and trying to extend almost finishing story… nah, not my taste. Characters motives was already flushed out in a build-up part. There were some good action and lots of talks in first two acts. Instead of getting some more action scenes and a few talks, we get totally opposite of it. Lots of talk, less action. I liked the way it ended, mostly because that narrator shut up. That son of a b*tch! It was exactly like chitchatting people in a cinema saloon. Whatever. I get extra angry at these issues, because I am a writer too, and when you do a payoff you gotta do it correctly. I loved how FMAB’s payoff went and I was expecting something similar. Liked the whole arc, despite it had huge problem at the end. 8.5/10
The last arc. Finally we get to meet the guy we were searching for and he is a F*CKING ASSHOLE! I told you that I’ll be quite critical about the anime. So Gon was searching for his father and we finally meet him. His son is in a f*cked up situation, no one can find the cure. What do you do? Nothing, you don’t even visit him. I remember the voice letter from Gon’s father, about hunters being reckless creatures. But this is not how to be reckless, this is how to be a total f*cking douche. I did not like Gon’s enthusiasm towards his father either. Ed (FMAB) f*cking kicked his father, hated him. But what Gon does? “Yaaay I finally met my father!!!” Nope, that’s not how you develop your characters. The other thing that also bugged me was the usage of various characters from previous arcs. They did not have any dialogs, they were just there for the sake of being there. Probably for fan service. Being said that, I loved Leorio’s part (note that I did not like Leorio at first arcs). Killua’s part was damn good too. Overall it was an above average arc. 8/10
There are still some things to be said before conclusion. Never ending stories like this one and like One Piece are not for my stomach. You could say that I despise them. Why? You see the word art is defined as a finished and brief product. You look at them and you pass by in search of something similar. Cowboy Bebop is an art, hell it is a masterpiece. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a piece of art too. I don’t and I can’t see this as a piece of art. This anime is not finished (just like its manga) and from what I know it was not going to anytime soon. The only reason why I did not like Berserk anime as much as I liked Samurai Champloo. Go on and hate me, It’s free, but that’s just my honest opinion on this subject. It also affects my overall experience with this anime. I can’t fully like it. Even if the inconsistencies I counted were not there and even if the anime did not have any clichés, I would not still go with 10/10. 
Yeah, about those clichés, the best female character in anime was Kite. Yeah, F*CKING KITE. I can’t accept that. I think we needed more Olivier Mira Armstrongs and Riza Hawkeyes (YES! FMAB AGAIN). I’m not a feminist or something, I’m just another writer who f*cking loves well written characters. The anime is full of kawaii bullsh*t young looking girls that are actually 20-40 year old and are plain dumb. However, I liked the girl who transformed into a big masculine woman, despite being cute, because she was not quite one dimensional.
By far the most interesting character was Hisoka. Why? Have you ever seen a pedophile-like nasty villain who almost sexually enjoyed good fights? I bet your answer is no. Killua was damn good too. He started off too over powered then showed his weak, humanly spots especially for his younger sister.  Now let’s talk about Gon. Or let’s don’t. Again, he was kind of a character that we all have seen in animes tens of times. Extremely enthusiastic, happy, reckless, straightforward guy. “I’m gonna do it!!!” kind of a guy. Not that different from Ash from Pokémon, or that main guy from Beyblade. He had his moments, like that final fight with Pito, but overall he was a little bit disappointing for a lead role. They could’ve as well focused story on Killua or even Kurapika. 
I’m a weird person but, this anime was really weird. By weird I mean, lots of weird things left being weird and did not get an explanation. How and why Killua’s sister became “Kay” guy? How in the world Gon transformed himself to older version of him? However, the biggest how goes to one particular dialog between Gon and Killua. The dialog about Gon’s dates with older women and… things that those OLDER WOMEN taught to Gon. Killua is like “He is already a grown man!”… What? Dude that’s not right. Nope… nope… I don’t even want the answer. Let it be unexplained. 
Huge plus comes from soundtrack. Don’t really remember exact names of the songs, but almost every single song that played during, before and after episodes were excellent. 
Did I like the anime? Yeah I did, it was good and I had a lot of fun time with it. It might be a great anime, but not a masterpiece. HxH is filled with too much clichés to be called a masterpiece. HxH’s best parts are SOME of its story arcs, SOME damn good characters, SOME action scenes. The only thing that can be used without “some” were soundtracks. They were awesome. HxH is an unfinished story and a good one even at that.

                God. Hunter x Hunter 2011. The story is constantly changing. And nearly every arc is amazing (only exception would be the second one in the tournament tower). I believe the best arc to be the Yorknew City arc, but that's a matter of opinion. But the overall story, Gon is looking for his dad and he gets mixed up in all sorts of madness along the way, meeting many great friends as well, including his best friend, Killua who's ACTUALLY the same age as him. The 17-year-old (but acts like he's in his late 20s) Kurapika, and the somehow 19-year-old Leorio. Every character feels real
                  and flushed out. They're consistent and each one gets surprisingly good development despite not all of them having consistent roles. The supporting characters also get a surprising amount of development (one of the advantages of such a large episode count). 
The animation is quite spectacular, though some tiny details can be slightly annoying, but the overall style is ver Mad House. When I first started the show and I saw the first shot of Gon, I actually shouted out ""VASH JUNIOR!"" Though Trigun's art was quite spectacular and they're from the same studio, so similar styles isn't a problem. The animation is very polished and fluid, especially later on. For example, during the final arc, there's a very emotional moment where Killua is crying, the animation of his eyes the moment his eyes well up is absolutely stunningly animated. The fluidity is also outstanding (especially in the Chimera Ant arc and the sixth arc) (The reason I keep saying 'sixth arc' is that the name of the arc is kinda a spoiler). Some of the fight scenes from the later part of the Chimera Ant arc are SO GOOD that you swear your watching something from Mad House with a film budget (which they didn't have for this show). 
The music is pretty good. The actual background music does a good job of setting the tone and filling the silence. The opening song is spectacular. It never changes throughout the entire show, but it is still spectacular and I listen to it on its own constantly. The various endings have different levels of quality. Ed 1: 10/10 Ed 2: 3/10 Ed 3: 9/10 Ed 4: 1/10 Ed 5: 7/10 Ed 6: 8/10. 
Overall this show is completely worth all the time it takes to watch it. This show is so much fun and so surprising that it will feel like half of the actual run length. WATCH THIS SPECTACULAR SHOW!",10

                If it was optional to rate this the highest number in the world, I would. 
This anime is an absolute shonen masterpiece. Never have I been so thrilled and  engrossed in an anime before. The story, the animation, the characters are all so equally unique and diverse. For example, one character wants to avenge his clan, one wants to find his long-lost Father, one of the characters is a psychopathic paedophile who occasionally get's boners yet manages to be one of the best characters in the anime. 
STORY (10/10): The story revolves around Gon Freecs, a passionate 12 year old with the desire of
                  finding his Father and becoming a hunter. Now it may sound like a simple-non complex story, it is. The thing that makes it amazing his how the story is told and how it plays out.  In order to become a hunter, you must go through multiple exams (if you've seen Naruto, it's similar to the chunin exams) whilst striving through the path, Gon meets three other people that he becomes great friends with. Kurapika, Leorio and Killua. When I say the characters are diverse, they really are. Killua is a former-assassin who is the same age as Gon and throughout the anime he really turns into a different character and secretly loves Gon. Kurapika is a blond-haired female-looking character who is my personal favourite character. Honestly, there are certain moments where Kurapika just flips shit and goes bat crazy *cough* Episode 47 *cough*. His clan was massacred by the Phantom Troupe for their eyes, who are also bat shit crazy and are some of the most badass characters ever. Leorio may seem like an asshole but in reality he's the most nicest guy's out there and secretly likes everyone despite him not showing it. Madhouse, the creators of the anime left the anime at the perfect moment and I'm glad they didn't continue the part in the manga otherwise it would just leave it on a cliffhanger.
ART (10/10): The animation for this anime is actually beautifully done. To be honest, Hunter x Hunter (2011) is one of the best adaptations of the manga ever. There are various fights throughout the anime that are perfectly animated, most noticeably episodes 126 and 131.  Episode 131 has this black and white animation near the end of the fight with an amazing soundtrack playing in the background and it's just eye-candy.
SOUND (10/10): The soundtrack of this anime is beautiful. If you've watched the anime, you know how good it is. 'Hyori Ittai (Lamento for Piano)' is one of the most heart-wrenching pieces of music I've ever listened to, it happens in a very saddening moment in the anime and if you ever listen to it after you've watched the anime, the feels will flood your room, honestly. Other amazing pieces are The Legend of the Martial Artists, The Emperors Time, Kage and Rasetsu, Riot and Kingdom of Predators. These all equally represent pivotal moments in the shows and is just pleasure to your ears.
CHARACTER (10/10): Okay, as I previously stated the characters in this anime are so diverse and great in their own way. Hisoka (the boner guy) is the biggest creep in the show and in one of the scenes in the anime he gets a massive hard-on for Gon, he's one of the strongest and most badass chraacters in the show and has a bromance with Illumi. Meruem, King of the Ants who looks similar to Cell from DBZ is a powerful smart villain who also develops throughout the anime after meeting Komugi. The game Gungi which Meruem and Komugi plays actually reflects what happens in the story and the meaning behind is very deep. My favourite villains in the shows, the Phantom Troupe are some of the most badass characters ever. There's one quote that the leader says that always gets me...""Go absolutely crazy"" and they do, the leader stands on a high story building and starts waving his arms like a crazy bastard and does a requiem for a member of the troupe.""The calendar looses a precious component, the remaining months gather to mourn, the mourners play a melody, while the eleventh moon quietly rises"" - after he says these words, your jaw is going to drop 9 metres.  Feitan, Phinks, Franklin, Machi and Shizuku literally go crazy and literally murder everyone, no one can touch them, even Hisoka (the boner guy) just stands there and finds it hard to comprehend the madness. Kurapika in the Yorknew Arc turns into a complete badass, he gets this chain ability and his eyes turn scarlet when he's angry and when that happens you know you're actually fucked, when his eyes turns scarlet it allows him to turn into a specialist and has 100% efficiency over all aspects of Nen. Also, Nen is one of the most contextualized powers I've personally seen in an anime.  
ENJOYMENT (10/10): I enjoyed this anime through and through and managed to finish it within a week and a bit, that's how engrossed I was in it. It's not all doom and gloom though, there are a lot of funny parts in it (mostly Hisoka) and will make you laugh various times. Another reason why it's so good is that it has no fillers at all.
To conclude, if you haven't seen this anime then seriously watch it, you will not regret it at all. 
P.S: Togashi if you are reading this, please hurry the fuck up. I'll be dead by the time the Dark Continent arc is finished.",10

                Best Combination. Gon and Killua.
HunterxHunter is one of the greatest anime series I have watched if not the best. The story is very compelling in a way that almost all of the events happening during the anime are unexpected. It also gives relation to the status quo of the world. Like the isolation of North Korea to the whole world, and different reactions of people towards domination, torture, and culture. You will understand what I'm saying when you watch it. Matching it with a good way of storytelling, the story is told properly and very understandable. It leaves me craving for more of the excitement
                  and surprises that I experienced upon watching the anime. I certainly hope that the anime would continue as soon as possible. 
The soundtrack of HunterxHunter is outstanding. If you've watched the first HunterxHunter series(1999), its opening soundtrack is as great as this one. A very memorable and catchy opening song and appropriate for the mood of the anime. I even listened to all of the ending soundtracks, which i usually do not do, because it really matches with what is happening on the anime.
What i really appreciate from this series is that they've given new ambiance to the parts that were covered by the first series. Although it lacks the emotions portrayed by the first series, it gave new mood to those first parts of the anime so I still watched it even though I've already watched the first series. When the anime gets to the part of the ants, it proves itself that is can be considered as one of masterpieces of animes.
Each character are well introduced and are all unique. The development of characters throughout the story is very visible and very convincing. I also really liked how they conveyed the different dilemmas encountered by each of the major characters. Especially on the part of Killua. Even information for minor characters are well detailed.
Overall, HunterxHunter is very unique and enjoyable experience. Especially if you have watched the first series(the 1999 series). A very good anime that deserves to be on one of the best. Take time in watching this anime. I learned many things because of this anime.",10
"
                It is an anime without consistency, where either it can have a bad bow or a good one, hunter x hunter is particular for being a generic shonen, instead of building a great final battle with a climax and an expensive conclusion, they prefer to end them suddenly, something good about hunter x hunter something that I like is the natural way where the protagonists join, they all have different objectives but it is justified why they are working together, the first arc is the only good thing it has is something remote, the exam is something that does not make sense and is unnecessary,
                  it is a survival test without purpose, the protagonists are saved by luck, nobody cares about the deaths, nobody is interested in seeing corpses is not human., the following arc is an arc to know to kiuba and only that, the next one is a tournament, very common to the other shonens, the good thing here is that the tactics are put on and it shows that the fighting is more mental than something else, the next arc is one similar to Sasuke's but much or better written has one of the best battles and is one of the best, the next one is bad, bad villains, without consistency and any sense, hunter x hunter has no constituency once it gives you a good bow and the other a bad one, the 5 Arco is the best of all, the most psychological with the best villain, the 6th arc is forgettable only that, besides that the motivation of the protagonist is ruined, because Gon finds his father and nothing happened anymore, his father did not Gon mind doing that I don't make sense of his motivation, he deserves a 6",6

When I watch something what I generally look for is something that can both entertain me and make me care about what’s going on. It usually does this by exceeding in a few certain areas: compelling characters, good pacing, an interesting conflict etc. Rarely does something come along that not only ticks all the basic boxes for being a solid piece of entertainment but manages to rise above that and become something truly breathtaking. This is especially true in the realms
                  of long running series, either in Japan or over here in the west. They generally conform to certain cliches and ground rules that they are reluctant to step outside, and while they may be highly entertaining and engaging for a few hundred episodes, they seldom offer much in the way of innovation or depth. So what does it take for a series to be everything one desires out of a work of fiction? To be fun, engaging, consistent, balanced, upbeat and entertaining but also deep, thought provoking, intense, genius, powerful and heartbreaking?
Well, it just has to be Hunter x Hunter, that’s what.
Hunter x Hunter 2011 is the second adaptation of the classic manga series by Yoshihiro Togashi, which started running in 1998 and has been running ever since(though with many hiatuses). Now, to clear my position I must clarify that I have no great bias against long running shounen series, they are actually pretty fun and often quite engaging. That being said, I also must clarify that this show is in a totally different league to all its competition but that is purely a testament to how absolutely amazing it is and not an attack on other long running shows. Merely by glancing at the score for this show on MAL’s top anime section you can guess that a whole lot of people love this series, in fact most people who have seen it love it. Despite this, I still think that people have not properly expressed why its so good as most of the reviews just tell people how different it is from other long running shounen without expanding on its merits independent of that fact. But that seems like enough rambling for now, lets get down to business!
Story-
Hunter x Hunter’s initial premise may be the aspect that puts the most people off because it has a supposedly cheesy shounen vibe to it. Now while I can partially see this it just seems like a silly complaint. Judging a book by its cover is something I vehemently dislike, though elitist anime fans are guilty of it all the time as are closed minded fanboys. So there’s a 12 year old kid called Gon Freecs who wants to find his father by taking an exam to become a hunter. This sounds kind of typical of an adventure show. However, the moment Gon sets foot into the hunter exam, we see the kind of world he lives in, and trust me its not a very pleasant one. The exam is gruelling, candidates try to trick others and even sabotage their chances of passing, murderers are allowed to participate and all kinds of other unpleasantries. Now instead of getting some OP power up or plowing through exam with the power of friendship Gon struggles through affair with perseverance, determination and just plain luck. This is very reflective of HxH as a whole. The main characters set themselves very simple goals but often end up being totally outclassed, being bit players in bigger schemes or having to settle for much less than perfect victory. The way it is written allows our protagonists to participate in an engaging scenario and have to deal with that scenario and grow as characters without them being the central players in all the conflict. 
The series’ fighting system, Nen, is a very complicated one but is balanced enough to provide the viewer with interesting fights and strategies without seeming like a convoluted mess of a power system. It also serves to balance our protagonists with some of the more powerful enemies in the series and provide methods in which they can have an advantage over their enemies by virtue of their creative use of their powers. Another great thing is how aside from strategy, the most important thing about fights in this series is experience. Hunters in the series don’t just suddenly become powerful, they have to spend years honing their skills on various missions and jobs that give them the experience and knowledge they need to be formidable combatants. 
The best way to describe the ins and outs of the plot would be to discuss the structure which, like many long running shounen, is divided into arcs. There are 6 arcs in the whole show(if you discount the 4 episode Zoldyck family mini arc which I don’t see as a full arc, just an extension of the first one). All of these arcs focus on our main characters reaching a goal they have set themselves while revealing more and more about Hunter x Hunter’s fascinating world. They all vary in tone, length and style but all still feel like different parts of the same journey. Each one is written with extreme detail and care, paying close attention to structuring the individual arc’s story in such a way that it feels complete by the end but there is always still room for the journey to continue. They also all conjure up different moods and themes. The hunter exam arc is an engaging underdog story that introduces the diverse cast of characters, the Phantom troupe arc is a dark, urban thriller that focuses on the thematic idea of a cycle of revenge and the chimera ant arc is a very long, dense war arc that brilliantly explores the ideas of evolution, human nature and morality. 
The sense of pacing in each arc is excellent and the writing is flexible enough to change the pacing depending on the scenario. For example, during the palace invasion section of the chimera ant arc the pacing slows down to immensely slow speed in order to capture the brutal intensity of the situation and the sheer amount of things happening at once. These changes in pace irk many viewers though to me I can’t see how the series would work without them as they are necessary for squeezing the full dramatic impact out of every moment. The tension in every arc is also unparalleled in its intensity. A combination of the pacing, the characterization and the scenarios make some moments in this series almost heart stopping in how tense they are. This combined with the very clever dialogue and battle strategies that HxH employs mean that its a very polar opposite watching experience than most shounen in that you really have to be paying attention to soak up the full effect of everything. A thing I see a lot of people complaining about is the lack of a big climax in every arc. In many shounen series there would be a big epic battle to end each arc where all the villains die and all the heroes nearly die. HxH arcs don’t have this no but they do have emotional and thematic payoffs that to me anyway feel just as satisfying as  as a big battle would. 
My favorite and what I consider to be the best arc would definitely have to be the chimera ant arc. Its based around the idea of another species evolving to a point where their intelligence and numbers rival that of humans and a long and bloody war breaks out between them and the human race, led by the hunter association. This arc is where the previously mentioned tension is used to full effect and all the intelligence of the writing is used to construct a truly breathtaking 60 episode experience, its one of those stories that can’t really be explained and just has to be experienced. 
Now to talk about about weaknesses. While there certainly aren’t many major weaknesses, for the sake of being a fair critic I do have to mention them. Of all the arcs, the Greed Island arc would have to be labelled as the weak point of the series. Now, don’t get me wrong, the arc is still solidly written and entertaining enough but I feel it has a fair share of problems. Firstly it takes place inside a virtual reality game and it feels like a bit of a tonal shift from the rest of the series. It distracts from the very interesting world of HxH to kind of do its own thing for 20 episodes. I also think the villain in this arc is pretty weak and cliche which is surprising as this show generally has really brilliant villains. I just feel that the arc feels less like it takes place inside the gritty world of HxH, full of assassins and thieves and more like its from a different show.
 Other weaknesses are minor ones such as a few minor plot holes here and there and some questionable character decisions but considering the ambition of the show, this is somewhat to be expected. Other people point out pacing issues, an inconsistent first few episodes and other perceived problems but I honestly can’t see these let alone think they are major issues. Overall, the weaknesses, of which there are few, do little to harm the impact of the series in any meaningful way and doesn’t stop HxH stand out for having one of the most complex, unique, varied and engaging stories in all of shounen.
Score- 9.2/10 Very solid arcs, great tension, brilliant pacing, genius writing and full of intriguing ideas
Characters-
You thought the story was the best thing about this show? Well think again because the characterization may be even better. Firstly I should mention that this show has an absolutely humongous cast. There must be at least 200 named characters by the end of the show and most of them serve some kind of purpose within the narrative. For this section though I am just going to discuss the main characters, the villains and some of the other standouts. 
Gon Freecs is our hero and from the offset he may seem like a rather typical shounen protagonist. He’s upbeat, determined and stubborn. However, over time we learn that Gon is not a simple individual nor is he driven by any typical goals. He searches for the lifestyle of a hunter to see why his father decided to become a hunter and hopefully one day to meet him. But, Gon is an underdog throughout most of the story and many of his traits end up causing him to lose more than he wins. His determination and stubborn nature cause him to suffer great physical and mental damage over the course of the series. His determination and naive nature lead him to have a lack of critical thinking ability and a warped sense of morality. Despite this, we understand Gon’s emotions and drive enough to want him to overcome the obstacles in his way and we don’t connect with him just because he’s the good guy but because he is a very understandable character.
Killua Zoldyck is Gon’s polar opposite in many ways but also shares some traits with him. Cold and logical, Killua was raised to be a professional assassin but abandoned his family and that destiny to take the hunter exam. He hides his trouble childhood and family problems behind the facade of a normal kid. His friendship with Gon is one of his main reasons for not wanting to go back to his life as an assassin and the relationship dynamic between the two continuously evolves in each arc. 
Kurapika is a revenge driven exam candidate who Gon meets on the way. Also cold and calculating like Killua he has dedicated his life to finding the thieves who killed his tribe and harvested their scarlet eyes(Still think this is a kids show?). He claims he doesn’t need friends as they only distract him from his goal of vengeance which he is aware will lead him to dark places. His character may seem to be simple and closed minded but his motives and choices become increasingly complex as events play out especially during the Phantom troupe arc where he becomes the main character for 20 or so episodes.
Leorio is the oldest of the main characters and is taking the exam so he can train to be a doctor in order to help his poverty stricken hometown. He may appear to be the token comic relief character but he has a lot of depth to him and proves to be a useful ally to the other main characters even though he is not particularly useful in battle. 
These main characters all have great dialogue and chemistry with each other and the interactions between them form the initial charm of the series. However the show would not be half as interesting if it weren’t for the villains. The villains are equally as interesting if not more so than the protagonists. For example the morally ambiguous psychopathic clown Hisoka casts a great sense of threat in the early episodes but his motivations are arguably more sinister and bizarre than they initially appear. Then there’s the Phantom troupe who, even though they are ruthless thieves, have a definite sense of camaraderie and enough personality to help you see them in a different light than just being bloodthirsty killers. Even the non-human villains have a lot of depth to them. I am of course referring to the chimera ants, whose characterization both as a species and as individuals is absolutely fascinating. The standouts among the ants include the ant king Meruem whose journey throughout the arc is equal parts emotionally shattering, thought provoking and unforgettable, his royal guards Shaiapouf and Neferpitou who receive a lot of visible depth and development and also some of the other normal ants like Welfin, Ikalgo and Colt. 
Even the background characters and characters who only show up for a brief role in the story can leave quite an impact, that’s how great this show is at packing personality and detail into every aspect of its narrative. No, not every character is given focus(that would be impossible!) but the show is pretty impressive with how it measures everything out carefully to provide you with enough information to be satisfied while still keeping you wanting to come back for more. 
Score- 9.5/10 A whole lot of them but somehow it manages!
Art-
Hunter x Hunter was animated by Madhouse who are revered for many high quality TV anime productions over the years such as Death Note, Black lagoon and Monster. They are generally known for their high quality animation and this show is definitely no exception. To keep up a show looking this good for 148 episodes is just staggering. The art style itself is initially quite colourful which is probably another reason why people dismiss this anime as a kids show. Though as you make your way through the series you realize that the art style is actually very flexible. Its incredibly detailed and crisp use of colour and texture is able to create a variety of different environments and atmospheres. From the lush paradise of Gon’s home of whale island to the urban fuzz of Yorknew city everywhere in the show feels distinct and detailed which adds to the overall tone of each arc. The same can be said for the character designs. The great thing about them is that they are all unique just like all the characters themselves and no two designs look the same. While the designs themselves are wildly creative they have been criticized by some for being a little too bizarre and at times cheesy. This I can agree with but I don’t see exactly what the problem is here, its a lot better than having a cast of indistinguishable muscular psychos who beat each other up for episode after episode. HxH’s designs may be rather quirky but the show still manages to come across as much more mature than many shows with more realistic designs. 
The animation is pretty solid for the most part though at times it is clear that Madhouse are on a budget of some sort as there are occasionally skimps and still frames in some of the fights so this is a thing that occurs a lot in shounen due to what I assume is an absurd amount of money required to keep animation quality consistent for hundreds of episodes. Though when the fights look good they REALLY look good. The intensity and breakneck speed of the fights is captured perfectly and adds to the already sky high tension of these scenarios. This is a pretty solid effort for such an ambitious series animation wise and a few hiccups here and there can certainly be forgiven. 
Score- 8.8/10 Beautiful landscapes, mostly great animation and unique character designs 
Sound-
As far as the OST goes its wide and incredibly varied. There are many tracks, some that play throughout and some that are restricted to specific arcs. Most of the music is orchestral but it incorporates other genres and elements too such as electronic beats, distorted guitars and piano ballads. The soundtrack also evolves to match the tone each arc and each scenario. Early in the series songs like ‘The world of adventures’ with its circus like mood signify the initial adventurous tone of HxH. Later on in the Phantom troupe arc we get more dramatic and operatic pieces like ‘Riot’ which reflect the chaos of the events happening in that arc. Then there are specific character themes like Hisoka’s flamenco influenced character theme which sums up his insanity and unpredictability so well and the Zoldyck family theme which sounds fittingly foreboding for such a dysfunctional family. But, by far the best of the music comes from the chimera ant arc where it really helps to add to the tension and mood of everything that happens. The haunting and frantic violin piece ‘In the palace’ forms a great backdrop for a lot of the tension in this arc. Then there’s the battle theme ‘Hegemony of the food chain’ which starts reservedly before erupting into a storm of distorted guitars that adds to the frantic nature of a lot of the fights that occur in the arc. Finally you have the heart crushingly beautiful ‘Understanding’ and ‘Elegy of the dynast’ which greatly enhance some of the most solemn moments in this arc. I’m not going to lie, i’ve spent many a time since I finished this series curled up in my chair listening to these pieces reflecting on the brilliance of this arc. This is a massive soundtrack. Its fitting, impactful, beautifully composed and greatly complementary to the HxH experience.
As far as OP and ED’s go, there’s not a whole lot to say. Throughout the series it maintains 1 opening and i’m not going to lie, this probably wasn’t the best idea. Don’t get me wrong the song itself ‘Departure’ is infectiously catchy and good to introduce the series but with how dark everything gets as it goes on it feels a little redundant and unfitting. Thankfully the 6 ED’s are much more varied. They match the tone of their respective arcs and parts of the show very well. My favorites would have to be ‘Hunting for your dream’, an upbeat power metal song which got me so pumped to watch the next episode during the Phantom troupe arc and ‘Hyori ittai’, a more solemn acoustic song that always made me reflect on the episode I had just watched during the latter stages of the chimera ant arc where it played.
When it comes to voice acting I have to give a fair amount of credit to the seiyuu for doing a pretty damn good job with such a large and varied cast. The voices fit the characters and are more than competent at pulling off all the comedic, dramatic and emotional scenes when the show needs them to. Megumi Han and Mariya Ise play the parts of Gon and Killua very well, sounding very convincingly like 12 year old boys and perfectly capturing the personalities of each character with extraordinary flair. If I had to choose other standouts I would go with Daisuke Namikawa as Hisoka who sounds so delightfully insane its legitimately frightening at times. Next would be Miyuki Sawashiro as Kurapika who sounds convincingly like a person severely haunted by their past but strong enough to endure it. Finally my last standout would be Koki Uchiyama as the chimera ant king Meruem who really gives life to the king’s journey throughout the arc though saying anymore would be spoiling. 
Score- 9.4/10 Beautiful OST, great voice acting, could have done with more openings
Enjoyment-
Do I really have to tell you that HxH is an enjoyable show? Well it damn well is, one of the most enjoyable i’ve ever watched. Though i’ve been mentioning all the little details and nitty gritties that make HxH completely genius these are all things I picked up after contemplation, the show itself gives you almost no time to think about those things! Every episode, every moment, every event is utterly thrilling or engaging in a different way. Even episodes that are mostly talking or contemplating are still highly entertaining due to the wealth of things each character and the show itself has to say. You will marathon this show, it is inevitable, you just won’t be able to stop yourself. But, at the same time, you’ll also be tempted to take systematic breaks to prevent your heart stopping and to savour the experience of watching such a fantastic show. The tension is, as I previously mentioned, unparalleled and that is a great factor to the enjoyment. Also, the series has an absolutely brilliant handle on cliffhangers that almost unfairly tease you into clicking the next episode button. So yes, this is an entertaining show, from beginning to end it never feels like a slog despite its length and in fact will probably leave you wanting more.
Score- 9.6/10 Tension through the roof, cliffhangers everywhere, not a slog in any way 
Conclusion- What else am I to say? This is without a doubt a show of the highest caliber, it deserves to stand up there with FMA as one of the greatest adventures anime has to offer. If there was more of this show, i wouldn’t hesitate to get on it. I know the writer takes many hiatuses but can you blame him? Do you really expect him to write stuff this good consistently? This is one of the greatest anime, scratch that, one of the greatest TV series I have ever watched to completion. I’m sorry for being redundant, I know everyone and their mother loves this series and has articulated how much they adore it on this very site. My cries of love for it may very well be drowned in the veritable cascade of fans that have taken the same emotions to the slate but I tell you, there is no anime more worthy of that treatment than this one.

                I'm starting out by saying, hunter x hunter will always be my favourite shounen, BUT it's not for everyone. Even some shounun fans may not instantly like hunter x hunter. But those who do, love it, and I mean REALLY love it. 
I went in expecting a couple of kids exploring the world, with some action and wacky characters and creatures. What I got out of it was so much more. The action elements, fight scenes are some of my favourite anime fight scenes, and the characters are all mostly unique and really grow on you.
It's a fairly long anime, but I loved every arc
                  that it gave me. Hunter x Hunter may not be the jam for some people... But I loved it till the very end!",10
"
                i will start with the negative ones, because the rest of it is me saying how epic this anime is. PLUS, before you watch this anime, you really need to watch the 1st episode of the original HXH, because it will be needed later on.
NEGATIVES: slow and kinda childish beginning. every arc is above ""good"" but if you compare the 2 best arcs with the 2 worst youll see the difference. even tho it ended in a satisfying way, its still bothersome that we know the manga is ongoing but it will never finish. one scene in the beginning wasnt added, which made some plot
                  holes, so you need to watch the 1st episode of the original series
STORY  9 / 10 : its impossible to review the story when it completely changes throughout the arcs. so i will review each arc with NO SPOILERS
1st arc  (7/10): slow and childish (at first), good fights, simple plot. main genres/themes: action, adventure
2nd-3rd  (7/10): quite a lot of character development, we get to know more characters, great fights. simple plot/story. main genres/themes: action
4th arc (9/10): its one of the best. theres so much suspense, the fights are amazing, strategy is needed bc ""power"" is irrelevant compared to strategy in this anime. it starts to get dark themed. main genres/themes: action, crime thriller.
5th arc (7/10): this arc was made to develop the main characters' power so that the next arcs can have even more wonderful fights. main genre/theme : action, real life videogame (sao type, but better).
6TH ARC ( 10/10 ) : THE BEST. NOT GONNA SPOIL, BUT GETS DARK AS FUCK. main genres/ themes : war, drama, action, politics
7th arc (7/10): a nice arc to end the journey. main genres/themes: action, politics
ART/ANIMATION 10/10 : the art style is simple and kinda cute. but the animation is the best ive seen. the viewpoint constantly changes throughout the fights, the emotions are shown in the best way possible. the art seems light and cheerful at first, but the use dark colours and creepy facial expressions really often
SOUND  10 / 10: the best soundtracks ive even heard in my life, no joking. at first they are happy cute ost's. but the ost's used in the 6th arc are amazing. main instruments are piano and violin. in one episode they used mozarts lacrimosa and one of the soundtracks is inspired by prokofievs dance of knights. 
CHARACTERS  10 ++++ / 10 : the best character development ive ever seen. its like FMA and FMAB combined together x 100. the 1st mc (gon) at first is really simple without too many things said about his past, tho after ep. 80 he changes dramatically. all the characters are unique and the majority is amazingly developed, however 3 character in my opinion change dramatically throughout the series, gon killua and meruem.
ENJOYMENT  10 ++++++++++++++/ 10 : even tho i mentioned some flaws, they really did not affect me during watching this show, its my favourite anime and i love it to death!!!
VOICE ACTING 10/10: AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i have to say, megumi han started pretty uneven but her performance got developed along with her character. 
OVERALL : ... youre still reading? shh, go watch it. now. oh youve seen it? go rewatch it . now! 10 / 10",10

""Anyone who's risked their life with you is a friend""
-Knuckle,Hunter X Hunter 2011.
Hi.Im a random guy in MAL that's doing his favorite anime's review.And i should speak here that Hunter X Hunter 2011 is NOT the 1999 version.There are some differences between them,the art is WAYYYY better and there's 2 new Seasons.
Alright,lets talk about every season:
1-Hunter exam:
That's the best example of ""Starting"" in anime,because they're introducing the anime to you,so what's better then series of challenges that involves Friendship,Persistence,Strategy and Teamwork?That's why i love Hunter X Hunter,they care a LOOOT about their characters and about what
                  they can or cant do,not like Fairy tail,where Lucy cant do anything,but the anime makes points on the story where she doesnt do anything just for showing how bad she is at fighting.
Alright,here's the thing:I tought it was gonna be like Naruto or Bleach when i started the anime,because it looked like it was gonna be all clichê and boring things i already saw in DBZ.How wrong i was....
Retiring Tonpa,this season is for me the best they could have done for a ""First season"" of the anime.
2-Heavens arena
Alright,some people speak the second saga is the ""Zoldyck family"" arc,but i disagree with that.So let's talk about where the thing gets serious:The nen introduction.
Alright,normally the anime ""Energy"" (Like Ki or Chacra) is a thing that the mangaka creates as a thing that explains everything in a simple way,but WHAT THE FUCK is wrong with nen!Its complex compared to any other anime energy! (Come on Naruto fanboys,im asking for it) Alright,i tought the nen was complex,but interesting at the same time,because look at DBZ:Ki is just a thing they added to ""Explain"" how shitty attacks like Kamehameha works.Nen explains how the attacks,the psychologic of the characters and how everything works!
(Spoiler alert) When Hisoka and Kastro fight and the fight ends,the anime shows you that nen is serious stuff.If you watched it,you know.Shonens usually dont mind to take some details,they just put shitty moves and talk this is cool (Cof* Nanatsu no taizai Cof*) wihout showing their potential.Later ill talk about how the potential of the characters is showed.
Alright,when the our protagonists finish their fights,everyone is going to go to York Shin.And i think this is one of the best anime arcs EVER.
3-York shin:
It is perfect.Just Chimera Ants can beat it.All the character's psychologic enters here.I gotta talk about how Geney ryodan was well-explored in this arc.(Nice they explored them in this arc because in the others they didnt appear much Cof*) Anyways..
This is not a shonen anime.If it is,it is the best ever made.Because this isnt a fight to rescue a lady,or a tourney to see who's stronger.But in this arc there's a big fighting scenerial between the Geney Ryodan,the Shadow beasts,the our protagonists,The assasins,the Mafia and the Body guards...wow...
And in this arc the anime showed us how good he is,with every character having his different personality and way of thinking.Also,they dont leave any character behind,all of them have importance in the anime.Ill take more about this in chimera ants.They do not use fists,they use strategy for fighting.
4-Greed island
So gon enters in the game that his father made,and i confess that this arc is the worst of Hunter X Hunter,but remember:Its Hunter X Hunter,so nothing is normal.In this saga's the first flaw of the anime (At least for me) and that is how the anime puts some weak characters that passed in a exam.If you saw the anime you know what im talking about,but in Greed island are some people that are scared of everything,to enter in the game you should use Nen correctly,and not just go there and speak: ""Hey can i enter?""
I thought it was a little boring at the start,because they didnt find biskuit yet.But when they found her there was the best Dodgeball game of the story of anime.If HXH was a sport anime,it would be the best one (Sorry Kuroko,i love you but its freaking HXH) and i really like how they explorate killua and hisoka in this game.And lets not forget about gon!How he was using the Jajanken in this game was fantastic and it made me animated like i was in Pokemon when i was a child...good times...
SO LETS GO TO THE BEST SHONEN ARC...WAIT:THE BEST ARC OF ALL ANIME:
5-Chimera ants.
Alright,so here we are.They made a psychological and strategy mixed with fists and fighting in a arc.And it was perfect.The introduction of the characters is perfect,maybe the best i ever saw.Incluiding Pitou's and Meruem's.But not pouf's,i hate that guy...
Well,lets continue on:The anime shows us a really creative thing with the mutant ants and with the new powers of the characters.I divide this arc in 3 chapters:Infiltration,Preparation and Fighting.You can call the third chapter ""Infiltration 2"" if you want.
So lets talk about how the character's potential was in HXH with the best example:Knuckle and Meleoron.They had both unique and creative powers,and i love those powers.But the way they're used together is fantastic...at least they WERE fantastic until the ""Infiltration 2"" chapter started,if you watched it you know why.
(Minor spoilers:) There's the gungi thing with meruem that i thought it was the most creative game they could have done.And the fight between Meruem and you-know-who-i-wont-spoil-much is fantastic.How meruem uses his strategy on the gungi for fighting is fantastic.I talk the word ""Fantastic"" a lot.Fantastic.
Now if you have watched all,you should have thought: ""Wait...but meruem is right after all!He could be a great president,better then some we have in our world at least"" and that's right.We human are worse then ants.We make nuclear bombs,we are the real plague of the world.If you thought the ant you killed yesterday was just a piece of crap,you're a monster.And we all are.I just killed a fly now.We retirate lifes for our pleasure,and sometimes even by accident.We make war and disorder.We are worse then any living creature.In the end the our heroes didnt say ""Yey we won"",but they said ""We won,but...was that the right thing to do?...""
6-Elections
Alright,so here's the final one.Leorio shows up again (The best way possible) and we have a new character,Alluka.She/he's cute and all,but didnt cativate me that much.
What i like about this saga is the way of how togashi ended this series.In a perfect way.I will not spoil it but its perfect.Watch it by your own and discover why its the best anime ever.
(Here i end talking about the arcs)
Story:10/10 
Its a little clichê the way of HXH telling us the story,but it worked well and all.Gon is a kid that wants to find his father,but the way its told to us is perfect.Almost a 9/10,but 10/10 because its HXH.
Art:9/10
The art is great,but not the best that madhouse could have done.One punch man for me would get a 10/10,but Hunter X Hunter had great art,at least its not as bad as naruto's,which is shit.
Sound:9/10
The opening is the same one for the rest of the anime.Think about that:You are at Chimera ant's final stage and you hear that ""You can smiiile again"" for the 39201 time.How do you feel?But the OSTS are so good i gave a 9/10
Character:10/10
I must say its my personal opinion,but i love Killua,Gon,Knuckle,Ikalgo,Biskuit,Alluka,Pitou,Meruem,Kurapika,Leorio and Chrollo.Knuckle the most because...i dont know why.
Enjoyment:10/10
There are some parts where it comes slowly,but the enjoyment of the series is so good,there are parts that you cant do anything but laugh.
Overall:10/10
This is a complete masterpiece.I feel bad about the goku fanboys that dont know how to appreciate something like HXH.Watch it,you will like it if you like great story,characters,art and sound (But ignore Pouf and Tonpa,they are shit.)
So that's my Review For my favorite anime of all time.Thanks for reading!",10
"
                When I see this anime for the first time I didn't know how good it would be,but here the criterias:
Story:
A story about hunters and the world in which they live.This world could be as big as the world of One Piece.A very good story with a great message about friendship and how a good friend is.Isn´t very elaborated but with that message and characters is incredible and doesn't matter how elaborated it is.
Art:
As is costume,Madhouse animation and design is awesome.This art is the best in a story like Hunter x Hunter 2011,better than the 90th version.The scenes are awesome and character design are pretty good.Sound:
The sound in Hunter x Hunter is...good.In Togashi's animes like Yu Yu Hakusho and this one the openings are all the same but with little changes,while the endings are beautifu.The OST in HxH is pretty good,I like very much Hisoka OST.
Characters:
In this part,Hunter x Hunter is really good because first is our protagonist,Gon.This character at the start of the anime,seems very generic,but has his own personality and is very innocent,he has 12 years old.Then,my favorite and best character of this anime,Killua.As Gon,he is 12.But he thinks in what happens,also has some innocent aspects,but Killua's psycology is very human.He only wants to be Gon friend's and be with him.A pretty good character.Then is Kurapika,another great character.He is a very serious and decided person,he has passed through a very difficult situation and in the course of the story he becomes more cold.But he knows that being a good friend and a good ally would benefit him,not like Sasuke that only thinks in himself.And Leorio, a very funny character that also cares about his friends,is a very human character.
Conclusion:
Hunter x Hunter is one of the best shonen animes of all times and one very recommendated.If you didn't watch it,is time you do it.
Thanks for reading my review ^^.",10

                Overall I would rate this anime at 9/10.
Story (8/10) - I found the overall story to be really enjoyable. For the most part, the story moved quite well from start to finish, showcasing many great climatic highlights and the odd unexpected twist which really kept you on your toes throughout the series. In my opinion though, I found the ending episodes of the anime to be really lacking and I would have liked to have seen perhaps an alternative ending, but, it is what it is.  
Art (7/10) - The art was good and the character designs were pretty good too. I would still
                  say though, that I have seen better artwork and animations compared with this anime. I found the art of Hisoka to be very good and the lighting and shading surrounding this character was at a really high standard compared to the other characters.
Sound (10/10) - The soundtrack of this anime was really exceptional! It really draws you in and completes the whole scene. I'd consider the sound of the anime to be the true soul of it all. The character voice acting was really superb also. 
Character (10/10) - The character development is what I enjoyed most of all in the duration of this anime series. Gon's development through the anime as the main protagonist was often surprising as you don't expect him (the face of happy-go-lucky) to be overly intense, however, he was clearly a force to be reckoned with at times and really held the series together. My favourite character development would have to be Hisoka as he's one of those character that you really don't know how you should feel about; he shows both moments of being Mr. nice guy but can easily flip to being a true psychopath. It's amazing!
Enjoyment (10/10) -  I found this anime to be extremely enjoyable and would definitely revisit this series in the future. You will not feel let down by this anime and will feel like your a part of the story, growing right alongside the characters. I would most certainly recommend this anime to those who enjoy anime where the main character progresses and become stronger through the series.
Thanks for reading!",9

                Hunter x Hunter 2011 is a show that I am eager to talk about not only about the actual content within it's quite daunting 148 episodes, but also because of the stigma against long-running shounen series. It's easy to stray away from these types of shows because of the effect that other shows grouped into the same demographic and genre have on it. I was of the consensus that if you have seen one, you have seen them all. Dense main lead where all he wants to do is become the strongest in the world, every single female having at least DD breast size, the
                  one exception who has a small chest size for comic relief, etc. Hunter x Hunter 2011 is interesting to talk about, for me especially, as it almost completely takes this stigma and punches it to the outreaches of the cosmos.
Gon Freecs is a boy from the secluded Whale Island, and has high aspirations to become a Hunter to find his father who left him at a young age to persue his own Hunter related dreams. 
While this is Gon's main focus of becoming a hunter, the focus the anime is the various experiences and people Gon meets throughout his journey. The lack of focus on the end goal keeps the journey fresh and exciting during the whole runtime of the anime. One of the biggest positives of Hunter x Hunter 2011 is that it utilizes its 148 episodes to it's utmost potential. Each story arc and character, even a lot of the really minor ones get a lot of characterization and development. Even greater of a feat is that all of these characters and story arcs still manage to capture a general feel of adventure and wonder. You can't point to a specific arc or episode and say ""That isn't Hunter x Hunter"", even if that arc or episode could be focusing on completely different things from the last.
Another thing that the long runtime of Hunter x Hunter 2011 allows is for a gradual buildup of it's more darker themes that arise later on in the series. With all the time spent with the main cast during the tonally lighter earlier episodes, you can't help but get emotional when shit starts hitting the fan later on. And all of this could not have been possible without any other lead protagonist.
I can't think of any other character that would fit the lead role of Hunter x Hunter 2011 better than Gon Freecs. His optimistic and sometimes naiive personality work incredibly well in both the lighter and darker moments of this anime. When you see him excited about something and he gives off a massive smile, you can't help but smile with him, and vice versa. Viewing the  world of Hunter x Hunter through his eyes makes the show feel more like you are on the adventures that himself and his friends are on rather than simply watching it on a screen. Gon works so well with the show because of his simplicity in both design and and personality, since Hunter x Hunter as a whole is a simple extremely well executed show.
Killua Zoldyck is a harder character to talk about simply because he is more complex than Gon. The relationship between Killua and Gon is one of the main focuses of the show, and it pays off extremely well. Their personalities are so different, but their relationship feels so natural in both the intense and comedic moments of this anime. Killua himself arguably has even better character development than Gon, but I won't go into any of that for spoiler reasons. Killua gets a lot of screen time as well as Gon, and as much as I like Gon as a character, Killua is a very welcome addition as he adds an extra viewpoint to any given situation that Gon's personality simply does not lend himself to. Killua's more analytical ways at looking at most everything adds more dimensions to the topic at hand, which was greatly appreciated.
It would probably take me a full day of writing to talk about all the amazing side characters in Hunter x Hunter 2011. The ones that are meant to be focused on are focused on enough for me to be satisfied with almost all of them, which is a big accomplishment considering the sheer size of the supporting cast.
The group that I will talk about in most detail will be the villians. The Phantom Troupe, The Chimera Ant King and his Royal Guard, Illumi Zoldyck, Hisoka, all of them are amazing villians for their arcs. The only villian, and really the only character in the whole show who was underwhelming was the Bomber from the Greed Island arc, but even he had some degree of complexity to him. These are some of the most enjoyable villians I have seen in a long time, and I'm not really going to say anything about them as you should experience them, and the whole show, in your own viewing time.
Honestly, I would expect that during 148 episodes, the quality of animation would drop at least a few times during it's runtime, and even though it's Studio Madhouse we are talking about, it's still amazing that they managed to keep the level of quality high from episode 1 to 148. Granted, the animation never really reaches an extreme high point except for one amazing fight scene rather early on, but it's still worth commending.
Another random point I would like to add is the emphasis of strategy rather than brute strength in the world of Hunter x Hunter. Strength is still very much an asset, but it was thoroughly enjoyable to see thoughts running through various characters' heads as they think about every possible explanation for what may be occurring at the time. 
The soundtrack is, again, of very high quality. Not the best I have ever heard, but certainly up there. My favourite tracks are the probably the more upbeat ones from the earlier parts of the show, but each track fits the part of the show that it is meant to fit. The OP, even though it never changed once for 148 episodes, is still as high octane and energetic as ever, and even some of the ED's piqued my interest.
Lastly, big credits for the voice actors and actresses. Some of the best voice work I have heard pretty much ever, especially with Megumi Han as Gon Freecs. Amazing work from everyone in the voice cast.
Throughout this review, I have been giving almost unanimous praise throughout, but that's because I simply couldn't find many important flaws in Hunter x Hunter 2011. Everything from the narrative buildup to the characters to the animation and sound was handled so well that it's hard to not fall in love with this show. The best praise I can give Hunter x Hunter 2011 is that it makes 148 episodes feel like 26 or even 13 episodes. Not the best thing that anime has to offer, but pretty damn close. One of the few shows that I would consider essential viewing for any consistent anime fan out there.",9

                I'm glad to see HunterxHunter is gaining popularity! For those of you struggling through the first one or two arcs, keep going. You will not be disappointed. 
The magic of this anime, in my opinion, is its originality. It might give the impression of a typical shounen, but don't be fooled. The arcs are unique and the writing is excellent. 
And as for it being childish, it's only so for select moments. Believe me, just keep watching. 
Story: 
So... let's be honest. It takes a while to kick off, but it does have a few moments, even at the beginning, that keep you going. It's
                  hard to define the storyline itself, because it keeps changing, along with the whole tone of the series. This, I think, distinguishes HxH from other long-running shounens were everything starts feeling the same. The world is huge and the way we're introduced to it little by little is quite cool and intriguing. 
Sound: 
There are many memorable soundtracks, each of them quite different from the other- particularly during the Chimera Ant arc. The opening and closing songs grew on me even though I disliked them at the beginning.  
Characters:
Strong point right here. Well-delevoped, round characters full of surprises. Like the story, it takes a while for character development to kick-off, but the result is a very original, non-archetypal cast. Killua stands out in my mind, as do most of the characters -- except for the bomber and perhaps a few other extras. And while many seem to be typical at the beginning, they all grow to be quite unique. *Spoiler* --- for instance the Ant King. 
Art: 
The art is quite good, as is the animation. Many fights have you literally on the edge of your seat. 
Negative points?:
Well, a few. The pacing, tbh. It tends to slow down to a painful crawl at moments (think Chimera Ant Arc) and then pick once more. 
And while the main characters are awesome, many extras are typical and downright annoying. (think the octopus in the Chimera Ant)
Also, constant narration, so those of you who are put off by a narration... well, some parts might drive you crazy. 
Point worth mentioning: Manga is on-going, but at a mind-numbing slow pace. 
So basically, I'd recommend this anime for anybody that is sick of typical shounens with bad writing and endless fillers. It's an incredibly satisfying anime with very inventive plot lines and characters. 
Don't let the first few episodes scare you off... this is a great anime. So great that i can't resist giving it a 10 rating out of simple enjoyment.",9
"
                Shounen, we all grew up with them,  with the DBZs, the Narutos and the like.
As I collected experiences and ventured deeper into the World of Anime, my attention was slowly attracted by other genres while gradually maturing. Big hits like Attack on Titan catched my attention to recent shounen again, although AOT did 
surprise me positively at first, the hype soon died out for me and I couldnt enjoy it as much as I would like to. The good thing is that it motivated me to check out other new Shounen, one of which was the adaptation of Hunter x Hunter by madhouse. At
                  first it did not seem to stand out much, all i saw was little kids and naturally my expectations were to get just the same old battle shounen without any special elements despite following the shounen formula. Arriving at the second big arc I was mostly convinced otherwise and marathoned the show.
Sure there are arcs that arent the best and here and there you may discover some flaws, but the greatly developed and fleshed out charcters, especially some of the villains which i consider some of the best I have ever seen make up for it. One thing I liked in particular was the dark atmosphere that the show has in later arcs without being too edgy or tryhard, just right do indulge yourself in excitement to some events. There are also some twists, although the signs are indirectly given for an later upcoming plotwist, there is still room for improvement for some major plot twists and their foreshadowing which wasnt touched well enough. What i liked on the other hand was that the plot always moved in an unpredictable pattern and the suptle implemetation of philosophical and moral aspects into the world, characters and events in the series. The visuals were done decent and improve with later arcs, specificaly fighting scenes look fluid and good.
Another very appealing part of this anime is the audio, which was superp and was at times reminiscent to that of Death Notes ( same studio ). 
Perhaps my biggest complaint would be that the show left many threads untied, meaning that it kinda feels incomplete, and even though the manga is officialy ongoing, the mangaka is on hiatus until further notice.
Well at the end of the day I view hunter x Huunter as my favourite Anime, so  my rating can be considered highly subjective.",10
"
                So... where to start on justifying what is probably my least popular opinion of any series on this site.
Well, I don't think I'm generally an iconoclast. The anime I most rate are generally ranked fairly highly in the mainstream critical consensus and the shows I hate are usually not exactly well regarded. What I'm saying is, I don't have hugely niche tastes or an insatiable urge to slaughter holy cows of the anime world. 
The second point I'll make before getting into the meat of the review is that, my relatively mainstream anime taste not withstanding, I'm not the biggest shounen battle anime fan. It's
                  fine, I can watch it and be entertained, but I don't ever remember watching an example of the genre that genuinely blew me away. I grew up watching Dragon Ball Z and I have genuine affection for it to this day, but I've never been under any illusions that it's anything great. Naruto never floated my boat and certainly not enough to get through a combined 700+ episodes between the original series and Shippuden. One Piece... yeah, I've never seen One Piece, and honestly, if it hasn't gotten to any kind of conclusion in what is rapidly closing on 1000 episodes, I'm not sure I ever will. The truth is I find these shows to mostly be formulaic, repetitive and frankly I like concise, tightly written stories, not sprawling open-ended ones.
Well HxH ain't quite like some of these other examples of the genre and the truth is I don't dislike it. I just don't especially like it either. It's comparatively short and there is sufficient variety between its arcs that it isn't nearly as repetitive as most others of the genre. By the standards of its genre, HxH is fairly creative, imaginative story-telling, at least at its best.
No, for me HxH is let down at a more fundamental level before you can even get to its plot-lines and narrative adeptness. I don't like its characters. Not all of them, mind. Hisoka is pretty great, for example, but he is more of an exception than a rule. None of the main foursome hooked me in anyway. Leorio seems wholly superfluous to the story, whilst Killua left me cold. Kurapika is probably the pick of the bunch, but is still not a character that really stuck with me. 
And that brings me to Gon. I would say I find Gon to be an unlikable protagonist, but that would require him to have a consistent enough character for me to form any one opinion of him. The biggest issue is that there seems to be no firm idea of what his character is. I think there's a desire by Togashi and the show's writers to make him a subversive protagonist in giving him a far more morally neutral character than your standard shounen MC. The problem that arises is two-fold: one with that idea itself and the other with the execution.
The first issue is that having Gon be less than purely heroic makes him somewhat unlikable. Which is not in and of itself a problem - from Walter White to Lelouch Lamperouge main characters that are thoroughly unlikable as people have often proved to be some of the best. The difference is that Gon is nothing like as extreme as those two examples or, say, Light Yagami. Gon is nowhere near as extreme as those examples, and instead he just kind of falls in a moral middle ground where he's not enough of an anti-hero to stand out, but not enough of a hero for you as the viewer to actually root for him. There's also the fact that Gon just isn't... cool enough. Lelouch may have done pretty terrible things, but he was so damn stylish about them that it's a great deal of fun to watch him do them. Gon's just kinda bland and shounen-y without having the redeeming heroic traits that usually go with that. There's also the issue of his character's visual design which is just... meh. From his wide eyes and little boy shorts and boots there's something vaguely like an off-brand Astro Boy about the whole look. 
Still, a show can survive and even prosper with an entirely forgettable protagonist if the world and story it immerses you in is fascinating. On the former HxH succeeds to a greater extent than the latter. Whilst the setting is a little bit too large and sprawling to have the dense, interlocking sophistication in its world-building of the (on paper) similar Made in Abyss' more contained setting*, it certainly has some aspects that are difficult to fault. The Nen system is a much more thought out and well-constructed version of a common trope that certainly elevates the world-building here. There's certainly a lot in this world, but it does at times feel a little disconnected and a few too many world-building elements crop up and are then forgotten, giving the impression they were there just to service the plot of an individual episode or at best a particular arc. In short, the world-building here is strong, but not quite strong enough to achieve proper immersion in this fictional reality. 
The plot at its best is surprising and creative and at its worst trope-laden and predictable. I'm certainly intrigued by the flexibility of the show in almost shifting genres from arc to arc. I'm less impressed with its slow, unoriginal earlier episodes, which are really only salvaged by the presence of Hisoka who dominates the screen when he's on it, but isn't quite enough to truly save the whole enterprise from its crippling mediocrity. Things do get better and some of the post-Hunter Exam arcs improve on things. I haven't got to the Chimera Ant Arc, which seems to be the most divisive among fans of the show, judging by my Googling in writing this, but from what I have seen, the huge differences between each arc means that the show is very up and down in terms of excitement and overall narrative quality. This aspect of the show does, however, at the very least, save it from the fate of shows like Dragon Ball or the lamentably bad Fairy Tail where each arc seems to be a beat for beat recreation of that which preceded it, but with re-skinned villains (and possibly last arc's villains now fighting on the side of the good guys**). 
In terms of the overall look of the show, well, it's mostly pretty well animated and there are relatively few moments where any visible short-cuts are taken. That said the art style is not particularly inventive and, with only a few exceptions, the character design is more or less what you might expect of a show like this. It certainly doesn't have the kind of inventiveness of something like My Hero Academia or even Dragon Ball in terms of the visuals of its characters. Fights and action sequences look quite good overall and above the industry standard.
Voice acting runs the whole gamut from hammy to engaging whilst the sound design overall is competently, even well done without doing anything particularly novel. The music is pretty good and usually works well with whatever's happening on screen, though none of the in-show music has particularly stuck with me since I watched the show. The original OP on the other hand, is certainly memorable and easily distinguishes itself from the sea of forgettable pop numbers that dominate OP land.
So at the end of the day this show is fine. But for me to dedicate my time to 100+ episodes these days I really need better than fine and this just couldn't hold my attention. If you like the genre, it's probably better than most and you may well love it - judging by its MAL score it's got a big and very devoted fan-base. But, for me at least, it doesn't do anything to make it appeal beyond the limitations of its genre. It's subversive and original in some ways, certainly, but is still mostly pretty faithful to the spirit of the genre. This is certainly not Madoka Magica or Evangelion in terms of throwing out genre norms. 
Ultimately if I had to put my finger on why this series didn't fly for me, it's two main factors. The first is the aforementioned main character issue. If I don't care about these characters, I find it difficult to be engaged in their stories. Secondly the show seems to suffer an identity crisis. I made this point recently in comparing Darling in the Franxx and Gurren Lagann - the latter was not particularly original or subversive, but it knew unambiguously what it wanted to be, whereas the former was all over the place. A similar comparison can be made between this and something like My Hero Academia - this is certainly more inventive and original, but MHA knows exactly what it wants to be and is content to do that, whereas HxH isn't sure whether it wants to challenge conventions or try to exceed them. If it had opted to go one way or the other, it would likely have made for more compelling viewing. As it is, it just falls down a gap in the middle. 
* Kid has parent who is a renowned member of a legendary organisation of adventurers who, er, hunt for things, who maybe is dead, but actually maybe not, and the kid goes off into the wide dangerous world to look for them. That's where the similarities end, but they're there.
** In fairness to Fairy Tail, world history sometimes follows the same patterns. Look at how WWII Arc villains Japan and Germany joined the side of MC USA for the Cold War Arc.",5

                                                --- BEWARE THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ---
Lemme just say that this series : Hunter X Hunter (2011) was a heck of a roller coaster ride!
At first I thought this was gonna be a childish show so for months this was sitting in my ""plan to watch"" pile, until one day I decided to give it a go. It started off slow but pretty soon started to give me a tingle of exciting
                  after a couple of episodes. Pretty soon, I was hooked onto this series and gave it my full attention almost every day. This series produced some of the most likable characters I've have ever seen on screen, like you could easily grow attached to some characters right away on their ""first appearance"" episode in the series. Even a lot of the background characters are remembered by me. If you think this series is childish because the main protagonist is a 12-year old then you are sadly mistaken. Throughout this series, Gon has shown great bravely and talent, quickly going up in the ranks and even standing tall and straight against strong and fearful opponents in fights (both ally, and enemy). But also this series may not be as bright as you think because things can get pretty dark in this anime. The fights were pretty good in this series, I could sometimes find myself so excited for the next episode just to see a fight finish. I try to keep this review as low on spoilers as possible so it is your decision to watch this series and get the bigger details such as the characters, fights, and etc. I hope you guys will choose to watch this series and enjoy it just as much or more than I did. Sayonara!
Watch this series if you are :
1.) Too lazy to watch those 300+ anime (I felt the amount of episodes for this series was perfect
2.) A person who like main character(s) who are not at the top of the pyramid (the strongest).
3.) A person who absolutely hates filler and wants pure plot (by the way, there are some recap episodes, which can be skipped if you do not want to watch em).
But...
Be warned there can be some episodes with lots of narration that makes the series feel slow, and the opening song is the same every epsiode but the EDs will make up for it.",10

                Personal history
Hunter x Hunter 2011 is one best animes out there. Before I do anything else I just have to say I've watched the original one when it first came out and enjoyed, but I was little so I didn't really quite understand everything or the manga. I enjoyed hunter X Hunter, but I never consider it my favorite anime not until 2011 when madhouse decided to remake. when first saw it was happy, but I wasn't excepting that much from it. I thought it was going be the same except with better animation and looking shining. When I watched it all This became one
                  of favorite anime of all time.
The story starts out simple with Gon wanting to find his father who became a great hunter, so Gon takes hunter exam to become a hunter, so he can search for his father. That's main goal in the anime is to find his father and that's it, but what it takes to get there is what make the anime so good because it slowly starts unravel what world in hunter x hunter is like and becomes very interesting each time you watch it. I'm not going tell each arc is like because I feel like you should  watch them yourselves, but are reasons why should watch Hunter X Hunter 2011
Characters- They are great and are very unique. there are no characters that look the same. everyone has their own characteristics and facial features, unlike other animes. There're a lot of great characters in the anime.
Animation and art- it keeps get better the further you go down the list of episodes and gets to point its good as watching anime movie. it has 148 episodes and never once where there was lacking animation or art.
Battles- Animations for the battle are so well done, but also the battle are very smart and clever. Battle are unpredictable and that makes more fun watch because watching a main character win all time makes the battle boring plus main characters don't fight all the time it's mostly the side characters that are fighting and probably see fight once and that's it because fights in hunter x hunter don't leave their opponents alive to fight them another day, no most of time they kill them and they stay dead which I think makes the battles in hunter x hunter more epic
Music- You may say they reused some music a little too often, but from this anime I think I remember more of music than any other animes music. Most music I here from anime isn't very memorable, but if played random music from hunter x hunter I could tell where's that plays in the anime because the music makes scene from show more memorable, but make the scene even better because of how good it is and how unique the music play differently from other anime. The music is great, but I personally feel like hunter x hunter has the best music for expressing characters emotions and makes really feel the emotions that are coming from character its great feeling that only comes from hunter x hunter. Plus violins are kickass
Personal opinion
Hunter x  Hunter gets better the more you watch it and then you get chimera ant arc that well best thing you ever watched in your life because its darkest arc, but makes you feel so many emotions. This has one of saddest moments in other anime ever because makes cry every time I watch it. I personally don't want give out spoilers and even hints what happens in hunter x hunter because you really have experiences this anime to know what I'm talking about.
Even though they're little mistakes. this anime is a masterpiece",10

Honestly i think that this is the one of the most enjoyable animes. I will start off this review with a “may contain spoilers”'.
With that out of the way i can confidently say that if you are going to watch an anime that had came out in the last few years, add Hunter X Hunter on that list.
Story- 8/10 In one hand, the story is really engaging.. in the other hand, the execution of the initial setup of each arc really makes us wonder how good it actually is.. I mean that each arc ends in a strange way. ""That's it?"" Was the question that
                  I always had in the end of each arc. There are 6 arcs. 
Art- 10/10 Best art, and animation I've ever seen in an anime. Seriously, a solid 10/10.
For a shonen, good animation to support all the action is a top priority. Never once was there a sloppy few minutes that lacked detail. Everything was always 110%.
Excellent work to the studio that animated this. 
Sound- (10/10) - The soundtrack of this anime was really exceptional! It really draws you in and completes the whole scene. I'd consider the sound of the anime to be the true soul of it all. The character voice acting was really superb also. 
Character- 10/10
This category is where Hunter x Hunter shines. The characters and their developments are extremely well thought out and often impressed me. There are so many characters to love and to hate. It's rare that a series can present defining characters AND be able to develop them with careful planning and meaningful conflict. I could go on and on for hours about why I hated or loved the characters that stood out. I personally don't care about what happens to characters that don't interest me. And from the start to the finish I was hoping that many would/wouldn't die. 
Enjoyment- 9/10
The overall enjoyment of this anime was really great. Usually in animes that I find boring or dull I skip a lot because i find them meaningless. In HxH I didn’t find myself skipping at all because there was so much action and it wasn’t just senseless action it had a plot to follow up on. The only reason I gave the enjoyment a 9 was because the start made it look like his main weapon was really a fishing pole and it had a slow start in my opinion, but to be fair it throws people off. I was going to stop watching after the third episode or so. 
But after he gets to the exam i found myself addicted to the anime. 
Overall- 9/10 
Overall, The array of interesting and unique characters is what really makes this series. HxH is not afraid to go with the cliche, make fun of the cliche, experiment with the dark and creepy, the light and fluffy, and everything in between. With 2 adorable yet terrifyingly powerful protagonists and their ever-changing company, you're guaranteed to come across multiple characters that you love, hate or just plain can't get your head around. But even without the constantly growing cast, Gon and Killua really do make this a special anime. Watching the two grow (albeit quite quickly with the pace of the anime) and experiencing all the WONDERS OF FRIENDSHIP AND SELF DISCOVERY is easily the main reason for my love of this anime. Not forgetting, of course, creepy-ass perv Hisoka on the side is just the cherry on the cake. -Neugh",9

                I don't know what people mean by ""build up"" but seriously don't even try to use this word. I watched about 30-35 episodes expecting a good fight here and now and not just one second kills but decent fights.
 But watching full 30 episodes was too much.  i have watched many good animes and those are not so boring and slow as this one. I watched all the major fights on youtube after getting bored. I don't understand all the hype about this anime. Didn't watch the old anime but still this one is too slow and no fun. I know many people say
                  that u have to be patience watch upto this much episode and fun will begin but enough is enough.
 Even bleach and one piece have boring episodes in between and same goes for dbz and others. But this is not that good for me. And don't tell me to watch the further episodes and all that crap. Lastly the word ""build up"" is ONLY ONLY SUITED FOR HAJIME NO IPPO. When i watched the anime in the beginning i was like what the hell this is so boring but when the story continued it REALLY BUILT UP and kept building up and especially the last season of it was just so much amazing that i was left so sad. I didn't read Hajime no Ippo's manga as i want to see it in anime. So please don't use the word 'build up' for Hunter x Hunter for its a shame to anime like Hajime No Ippo. Seriously i want to give 1 star but 2 more for animation and remake.",4

                The first word that comes to mind when I think about Hunter x Hunter is undoubtedly: VARIETY. With everything from insane, heart-raising action to comedy so ridiculous that I laugh alone in my room on numerous occasions; Hunter x Hunter is an anime that quickly shot to my number 1 favorite and only secures it's place more determinedly with every episode.
At this point, although still ongoing, I'm roughly halfway through HxH and I've loved every single minute of it. That's because in this show, every minute matters. You can't look away without missing something crucial, hilarious or just generally entertaining. I was a late comer
                  to the HxH bandwagon and after around 10 episodes, I was sorely angered with myself for leaving it this late. All I can say now is thank heavens I finally gave this anime a shot. NEWCOMERS. DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE LENGTH. WHEN YOU START WATCHING; IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER ANYMORE. Where I first found myself concerned as to whether I'd have the time or motivation to catch up with this anime, I now find myself worried about catching up and having to wait a week for each episode! And man, do those episodes fly by. The best anime are the ones that make it impossible to say 'okay, that's enough for now'. 
The array of interesting and unique characters is what really makes this series. HxH is not afraid to go with the cliche, make fun of the cliche, experiment with the dark and creepy, the light and fluffy, and everything in between. With 2 adorable yet terrifyingly powerful protagonists and their ever-changing company, you're guaranteed to come across multiple characters that you love, hate or just plain can't get your head around. But even without the constantly growing cast, Gon and Killua really do make this a special anime. Watching the two grow (albeit quite quickly with the pace of the anime) and experiencing all the WONDERS OF FRIENDSHIP AND SELF DISCOVERY is easily the main reason for my love of this anime. Not forgetting, of course, creepy-ass perv Hisoka on the side is just the cherry on the cake.
Overall this anime is just plain fun. It's addictive, interesting, varied and entertaining in every sense of the word. It really is an anime that has something for everyone. WATCH IT.",10

                Just finished Hunter x Hunter yesterday. Decided to write my first review, I hope everyone finds it helpful.
THIS IS THE BEST BL SERIES TO EVER EXIST LOL.
On a more serious note:
I decided to watch this since I was curious to see why it was placed #5 overall in the MAL rankings. 
I'll keep this short: Pros: This was a very enjoyable series and easy to watch, the story progresses well and keeps you interested. Good character development, plot, comedy, action, and serious moments which make this a great overall adventure anime. 
I don't think I agree with it's ranking as #5 overall anime though. I'd give it an 8.5/10 to be honest. 
Cons: The few negatives I had were that there some asspulls/typical shonen tropes. In the end this is still meant to be a shonen manga/anime so it's expected I guess. This show is similar to FMA:B in a sense/gives a similar vibe, though the FMA:B universe was more balanced/realistic in it's setting so they didn't pull any unrealistic/ridiculous moves. I would say shows like FMA:B, Steins Gate, and Shinsekai Yori are true masterpieces. Hunter x Hunter is an excellent adventure/shonen show and very enjoyable, I'm not sure if I'd call it a masterpiece though.",9
"
                Every once in awhile you come across a show that just refuses to fade away from your memory. It stays with you in such a way that it makes you question what is it about it that made you like it so much. After a good while contemplating that fact I think I finally wrapped my head around it.
Story: 9
Hunter x Hunter is not what you would expect after viewing the first couple of episodes. It starts out fairly generic, and by that I mean is that it may offer the ideia that it´s just another typical  shounen anime that we of the anime
                  community have seen so many other times before. This, my friends, is HxH biggest fault becuase im certain that many people have turned this show away exactly because of it´s beginning, that while not bad (certanly not for me xD) may unfortunatly trick viewers to the thought that Hunter x hunter is your typical shounen anime. This however, is not the case.
Hunter x Hunter is a breath of fresh air, a rare gem that you just dont find every day, that continuasly suprises you with it´s rich storytelling and unique settings that are capable of evocking enjoyment, anger, laughter, sadness, etc... 
It´s as if the show is always growing, getting more and more complex as it goes, not afraid of taking risks and exploring complex themes. This beguns to became quite aparent in the show´s third arc that is sure to real in those who are still not convinced of Hunter x Hunter ability to evoke suprise and emotional  investment. With that said I would just like to add that the Chimera Ant arc (one of the latter arcs of the story) is quite possibly one of the most endearing arcs to ever have graced the spotlight. For better or worse it will stay with you, with it´s unforgettable moments and deep layout that will surely make an impact.
Art: 10
Hunter x Hunter is comprised of 148 episodes and every single one of them is very well animated with the exception of some that are just borderline outstanding. The fact that a series this long is capable of maintaning such a great amount of consistency in it´s animation department is somewhat mindblowing and almost ilogical. Series this long require a large budget and regular maintenance of finance to keep going and to add to that, it is known that animators have a difficult life in the animation industry. Hunter x Hunter seemingly was capable to surpass all of this troubles or at least supress them as much as it could and presents us with a rich animation quality and great art esthetic.
Sound: 9
The OST for this series is also very memorable. There is a great use of symphonic music that largely improves as the series goes on and there is good amount of variety of music trough out the show too. If there is any negatives in this category would be that sometimes there is some misusage of songs in certain scenes which sometimes dont blend well together, fortunatly the times that this occurs are few in between.
Characters: 10
A big reason to why this series is so engaging is due to it´s memorable  cast of characters.  This series showcases characters that to this day still remain one of my favorites fictional characters ever created. They are not portrayed as simply ""good"" or simply ""bad"" but simply as people who make mistakes, questionable decisions and that show complex personalities that dont faulter into a simple category because in general people cant just be labelled as such. Gon, Killua, Hisoka, Netero, Meruem, Kurapika, Chrollo, Ging and so much more... Are a simple example of the great memorable characters that this show has and that surely will stick with you.
Overall: 10
I think it´s already pretty aparent where my stance is with HxH. It´s a fantastic anime that tackels original and complex themes, with a great cast, art and soundtrack to back it up that will hopefelly leave an impact on you as it surelly did on me.

                I hold the unpopular opinion that Hunter x Hunter is awful. Most of the reasons people praise it, I believe, have a weak basis due to generalizing events and cherry picking as well. For example, Gon. People like to paint him as a conflicted character, but he has mostly bland characterisitics with some inconsistencies thrown in.
The Yorknew City arc helps illustrate my point. Most of the internal monologue and dialogue is hamfisted (like when Kurapika first explained Nen contracts), as it seems Togashi doesn't know how to deal with exposition. It also doesn't help that he is terrible at tone shifts; the tone is all
                  over the place here and mostly comes off as edgy(Feitan likes to torture people for fun and it is thrown in the viewers faces a lot).
The Chimera Ant arc is extremely flawed. The largest issue is the narrator. It is god-awful writing skill if you have to directly explain what is happening to the viewers, especially when we can see it for ourselves; the narrator explains things that we can see on screen. There are also more terrible character cues here, like when the narrator had to flat out explain Shoot is a coward. Direct characterization is an awful writing practice since it is lazy.
Togashi does excessively explain. It also happens in the manga haha!there's like pages of literally paragraphs in each text bubble. HxH also does not seem to know what it wants to be. It does not have a clear concept or something. It does not have it's own characteristic. Does not have a novelty aspect about it. Sure naruto has it's flaws but you get a gist of their world, their ninjas, and whatnot but HxH is like sorta a mix of things and u don't really know what a hunter is until way way later on where they briefly touch on it.
There is a lot more flaws.",1
"
                From a young age, Gon Freecss had been interested in Hunters. This was because his father who he'd never been able to meet was a hunter. His dream was to find his father and make him proud. In the Hunter exam he meets three friends; Kurapika, a young boy who's the last in his clan due to a murderous collection of thieves known as the Phantom Troupe; Leorio, the oldest and tallest of the group, he hopes to become a hunter in order to use the money and privilege to become a doctor so he can perform a specific and expensive type of treatment to
                  anyone for free after his only childhood friend died from not getting the treatment; Killua Zoldyck, the only one the same age as Gon, he comes from a large and well known family of assassins, and has run away to become a hunter, until his older brother forces him home. 
The art style, even from episode one, is fluent, bright and fitting, and somehow this fantastic animation team can create the brightest, happiest expressions but also the most horrifyingly brutal and disgusting violence. The amazing animation paired with the incredible OST (original soundtrack) creates some of the saddest, funniest, more terrifying and most incredible scenes from any anime I have ever seen. The enjoyment I gained from this anime is phenomenal, and is by far my favourite anime I've seen this year, and is definitely in my top three best anime ever. Somehow this anime makes you love the anti villains and villains just as much as you love the main characters.
If you've thought about watching this and have put it off for a later date, you made a mistake. This anime is fantastic and it very enjoyable, interesting and lovable. I finished this anime, all 148 episodes, in 16 school days, and thought I enjoyed every second I regret watching it so quickly. The Chimera Ant arc is one of my favourite arcs ever and some of the characters in Hunter x Hunter, like Knuckle, Kite and Killua, are fantastic. I'll never forget about this anime and how happy and excited it made me, and in a lot of ways it reminded me of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. So, if you love an anime with fantastic character, animation and soundtrack that can be both light hearted and deeply heartbreaking at the same time, with amazingly written and creatively lovable characters and a story you'll never forget, this is the anime for you.",10

                SUCKER FOR SHONEN ADVENTURE ANIME?
FALL IN LOVE WITH COMPELLING AND WELL-DEVELOPED CHARACTERS?
ADORE INTERESTING AND EMOTIONAL STORYLINES AND ARCS THAT EXPLORE THEMES ABOUT HUMANITY AND INNER CONFLICT AND CHOICES?
WELL LET ME TELL YOU, HUNTER X HUNTER IS THE ANIME FOR YOU 
okay but seriously, this anime is a masterpiece. 
starting off, this hxh seems like your typical shounen genre anime, and has a very happy and lighthearted feeling to it. WELL
fast forward 148 episodes and you'll have been thrown into the pits of emotional hell and back, by the end left an empty shell of a person
the story: 
Hunter x Hunter main plot focuses on a kid named Gon, whose father is a Hunter, and has been absent for his entire life. Throughout the anime, Gon's main goal is to eventually find his father again. Although this story seems relatively basic, the journey Gon takes along the way allow the plot to develop into so much more. 
the characters: 
Togashi's ability to create a diverse cast of interesting and complex characters is incredible. Though the protagonist of the story is Gon, the anime takes time to focus on the development of other characters just as much. The characters show excellent development throughout the story. As well, this anime is very gender friendly: featuring excellent female characters, as well as trans character. 
Overall, Hunter x Hunter is well worth the watch. It is an incredible addition to the shounen genre, one that (in my opinion) soars above and beyond both Naruto and Bleach. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!",10

MadHouse has never turned me down, not a single a time.

Sound: 10/10
I know the opening didn't change , but seriously , who wanted it to change!?
it is a piece of Art , The Endings were masterpieces , the Osts Are Always good to listen and extremely Fitting and thrilling .

i think Hunter x Hunter has the most insane characters and character development , Our heroes started their way from the deep bottom , knowing nothing about the powers , so the character development is EPIC , Gon's , Killua's and the ""King""
Enjoyment: 10/10
Who can't enjoy Hunter x Hunter ?
Overall: 10/10
Masterpiece , i'd give it 11/10 or 100/10 but the highest score is 10 ^_^.

                This review contains spoilers.
Words cannot describe my disbelief and confusion about the high ratings for this show. I don't even know where to start. Almost everything is flawed in some way or another. Characters have no real development. The pacing is incredibly fast throughout the series, but for some reason grinds to a halt in the last season. Many of the actions taken by the characters have no consequences. The show doesn't know what it wants to be, constantly changing every arc. The ki/chakura/magic/""nen"" system is perplexing and always bends to the writer's will.and the point armour is just atrocious. I'm not sure how much
                  detail I can get into without having the review removed.
For some reason, with all these problems, people will pull the Rick and Morty reddit tier defenses of it being too deep.
Now that the text is under the ""read more"", we can talk about spoilers freely.
For starters, gon is an incredibly annoying MCP. He has no charm besides being 12, has no redeemable qualities besides being 12, and an overpowered MC. His plot armour is absurd. From the very start, you see him capture a fish 10 times his size without any of that physical power being explained in anyway. Then he manages to lose a million times with none of those losses mattering or having any impact on him because of... reasons. In a span of months, he and Killua managed to become two of the strongest in the whole world by doing something everyone was doing. But they're better because they're a ""one in a billion case."" Yea, how convenient. Compare and contrast the powering up of Gon to an MC like Luffy and Goku. One spent 10 years in the jungles, surviving and training, then went on his adventure. One constantly trains in new and harder ways to get stronger. While Gon and Killua just hit the genetic lottery,
The second thing I want to talk about is the ki/magic system. at first glance it looks very deep and thoughtful untill you look a bit into it and realize its literally just ""think of something and put your focus into it and boom it will happen!"" Like yea its somewhat the same for other shows but thing is those other shows make it make sense by making it basically your ki being blasted in a certaint way (like in dbz) or using it to do ninjutsus by special gang signs that most could learn. And what even is the point of having a ""good magic system"" when the fights suck? Its like bragging about having boxing gloves while not having hands. Like yea cool gloves bro! Hope you can actually use them after your 100th hiatus
Thirdly, there are a lot of inconsistencies and plotholes that simply don't make sense. How did the eggs of chimera ants get there before the nen users were devoured? How did ants gain such nen in short time despite it said that the ants have qualities of humans they originated from including the nen? Why was there such a diversity in ants despite it shown that the queen only ate humans for nearly second half of her existence? Why was gon let to live after breaking the deal that would destroy him and his nen? And bla blah blah. Could go on for days
Forth, chimera ant arc as a whole. Why is it considered such a masterpiece or the ""greatest arc in all of anime"" when it's actually the worst in the show itself? The narration sucked and none of it mattered in any way, shape or form since the plot proceeds forward even when something big happens because the plot said so. Are Gon and Killua failing the training? Nah, let them go fight the ants anyway. Kite is shown for less than 2 eps, but we should understand that we will sacrifice everything for him. Yep, Totally understandable. Meruem being alive for less then 3 weeks yet we should actually give one that he changed his mind from ""I want to kill all humans"" to ""i want to kill humans but keep some""? Amazing character development. kite at the end being alive and in the process making gons ""sacrifice"" pointless? Great! Can't have anything but a Happy ending. ""But he's iconic"" yea so is the jar man yet you don't see anyone saying the jar man had great character development and was one of the best e celebs. Not to mention the way he went out lmfao. Because of a nuclear bomb that was in the heart of some boomer LMAO.
This is taking too long so Lastly what might be the worst part of the whole show is how the main goal of gon was meeting his dad but that was thrown out of 20th floor window after the dude just came out of no where and was like ""yo"" like why even do all of that if the meeting will just be like that? ""But you don't get it you have to wait 100 other years for a new chapter because story gets better!!"" Im thankful this terrible show is in a hiatus. Hope this hiatus never ends. Its an insult to anime to place this at anything beyond a 5/10. And insult to all shonens",5
"
                This is my first time writing a review for an anime.
I know that there are 80 million other reviews out there that are better than mine but I still want to put my thoughts about this show for everyone to read :)
I’m pretty new in the anime community, so my apologies if my opinions don’t go with what you think based on my lack of anime knowledge. I’ll get better I swear!
Also, I’m not gonna waste time talking about the synopsis of this show; MAL has written a pretty good one for you already. Make sure you read it ;)
Intro: This show can be compared
                  to that one kid in school who’s not known by a lot of people, but once you get to know him/her, it changes you. This show is not like the other Shonen out there, simply because its popularity stays on the DL. But that’s what makes this show unique; it’s a hidden gem just waiting to be polished (*cough* *cough* BRISKY *cough*). I’m glad that this will be the first anime I’ve ever done a review on, so here we go!
Characters: You easily get emotionally attached to the characters. It’s pretty hard to name a character in the show that you truly hate because once you learn about their story and past, then you see the reasons for why their personality is the way it is. The characters all have a different way of thinking, and because of this, you’re able to gather more information about the storyline and plot development. The relationships between the characters all vary and are never the same from when they first meet. This allows the viewer to really see the character development happening. You also see some character development physically (especially with Gon like WOAH DUDE). Long story short, the characters are a lot of fun and figuring out their different personalities is even more fun. ~10/10~
Art: I’m not so familiar with art styles and how they vary throughout anime, so I'll keep it short and compare it to what I’ve seen so far. The colors and shadows that are used go very well with the ambiance of the show and its Arcs. The fight scenes are always animated to its best and never fails to go downhill after every episode. Just like one MAL reviewer said (Cresherhsm), it’s shocking how this show aired for so long, yet it kept up the solid animations and fighting scenes all the way until the end. The simple art allows the viewer to really focus on the show while still getting enjoyable animation. ~10/10~
Music/Sound: The music in HxH is beautifully written and really brings everything together. The intro/outro music starts off strong and gets even better after every new Arc. It’s upbeat, fun, and really brings out the Shonen feel of the show. The soundtrack throughout the show is amazing, and it never fails to have a song that goes great with what’s happening. There are some parts during the show where they could’ve used a different song to really capture the moment, but other than that, the music really goes great with the show. ~9/10~
Viewer Experience: I had SO much fun watching this show. The way each episode ended really makes you want to keep going and further the story. If you get emotionally attached to a show (guilty) then you’ll have many emotions going through you while watching, like happiness, anger, sadness, and that “feel good” sensation that really makes you more positive minded. HxH does everything it can to give you new information, and that’s really helpful when it comes to seeing the real deep meaning of the show. The way Togashi wrote HxH is far beyond from what I've seen with basically anything. They did an exceptional job at forming the Arcs and distributing the information only at times when they wanted you to know about it.
This show also keeps you thinking and making guesses at what happens next. All the fights that happen during the show are heavy on strategic thinking and the characters always seem to have the mindset that they are 2-3 steps ahead (when they really aren’t lol). HxH never fails to make you think and predict the next outcome, especially with the battles. ~10/10~
Negatives: I believe that this show is perfect and does not have any major negatives. But with such a perfect show like this, the only way to get some negatives is to be really picky about the show and find its minute imperfections.
- The beginning of the show really doesn’t set a good scene for what actually happens during the show. The first few episodes make the show seems like a typical Shonen where the adventures are gonna be fun and everything will work out for the protagonist when realistically, it’s the exact opposite. There’s a lot more to the show, and it has a really deeper meaning than you think, so once you get past the first few episodes, (honestly, once you get past the Hunter Exam Arc) then the show really shows its true colors.
- The sounds during the show sometimes don’t fit well with what’s happening. But this detail is very small, and it doesn’t distract you from your overall experience. Just, in my opinion, there just could've been better sound selections at some parts.
- The pace of the anime sometimes slows down and gets mediocre in the writing. This can be seen in the beginning of the Chimera Ant Arc. This could just be a little mistake, and Togashi just didn’t take their time at that one section to fine tune. However, this is a pretty noticeable difference if you’re super focused on the show. There are some episodes scattered here and there where the writing and/or its pace isn’t its usual best, but once again, it doesn’t take away from your overall experience.
Final Opinion: With my “amateur anime knowledge opinion”, the only thing I can really say is... invest your time in this show. This show is an easy one to marathon (I did it in under a month while still having school work!) and it’s most definitely worth your attention. The times staying up all night and avoiding homework were really, really, REALLY worth it and I don’t regret anything. I went into this without reading the manga or watching the 1999 original, and I still managed to understand everything happening.
While this is a review written by a rookie in 2017, where are thousands of other titles that have recently been released,  I don’t think any other Shonen can top this one or will ever be able to top it. It’s super unique and everything about it is just fantastic.
Favorite Character(s): Kurapika, Killua
Favorite Quote: “I do not fear death, I fear only that my rage will fade over time.” ~Kurapika
Characters: 10/10 (Amazing personalities)
Art: 10/10 (Beautiful)
Music/Sound: 9/10 (Great but misused at parts)
Viewer Experience: 10/10 (Incredible and worth your time)
OVERALL: 10/10 (Masterpiece)
I hope I did pretty good on my first review! :D Feel free to tell me how I did and how I can get better moving forward :)",10

                Based on recommendations of this anime, I had expected to enjoy it a lot more than I have. But even for a shōnen anime, Hunter x Hunter's plot and characters are incredibly one-dimensional. More importantly, the show fails to address some REALLY serious deficiencies of morality and ethics in the setting and plot.
For me, the two most serious problems are:
1. Gon's stubbornness. The creators try to present his stubbornness as a virtue, simply by having it be successful most of the time. But actually, when you take a serious look at Gon, his stubbornness is often quite stupid (with little or no reason, in advance,
                  to believe that it will be successful), childish and selfish. He seems to have no regard for other people. He only seems to care about his own feelings.
2. The show is extremely permissive of murder, torture and other vile acts. Whilst individual hunters may have better standards of morality, the Hunter Association is unambiguously evil. It tolerates the intolerable, and makes no attempt to establish any code of morality. Many of its members could be classifiable as sociopathic. Some are straight-up serial killers. The creators try to airbrush away these problems by using bright, upbeat art styles and music, but for me this makes the show EVEN MORE PROBLEMATIC.
I could only get to Episode 23 before the show's obvious moral deficiencies, plus my annoyance with the main character, forced me to drop the show.",4

                Hunter X Hunter (2011) is a masterpiece.
I began watching this series on Netflix just out of sheer boredom, and curiosity because I've recognized the name here and there. I'm the type of person who has trouble finishing things, whether they are games, anime, art, etc. However, I found myself finishing all 148 episodes in less than 2 weeks. I was hooked. I watched in class, I watched in the gym, I watched late at night in my bed, fighting to stay awake because I could not get enough!
Long story short, this anime has all that someone could ask for. An extremely likeable protagonist, deep character
                  development, complex and interesting fighting techniques, awesome characters, great laughs, terrible tragedy, clever fights, great villians, beautiful art, epic music and more. This is not your typical anime. This is a classic. In fact, many many qualities from this anime were used to create modern anime, like Naruto, which is again a reason why I'm baffled Hunter x Hunter is not more popular. Oh well. More for me.",10

                Hunter x Hunter (2011) is one of the greates pieces of (shonen)anime I've ever witnessed. I feel bad that I had it on hold for so long. But luckily when I strated to continue watching it I got pulled into the World of Hunters!
Story:
The main goal is very solid and easy to understand. It is the journey towards that goal that counts the most. Gon and his friend Killua travel across the world to find Gon's father, but along the way they find new friends, enemies, troubles and above all: An new adventure!
Also this show has the most interesting and varying arcs I've ever seen.
                  From one arc to the other you end up in a crime-thriller arc or a video game arc or a epic war between two different species. The arcs never seem the same of boring and still it is part of the same main goal that the series is all about. 
Art:
For those that are familiar with the art of the HxH manga know that the art in there sometimes sucks. It is sometimes even comparable with a concept sketch. But as bad as the art sometimes is, so beautiful is the art and animation in the anime. Never seems the art to disappiont. 
Character:
The amount of characters in HxH are big but this is in my opinion a good thing. The characters have creative powers, unique designs and really fleshed out. Every character could be the center point of a new arc and it would be awesome to see. Even if it would be minor characters that usually don't get any spotlight. That's when you know you have great characters. Still wished more cool characters got the spotlight they deserved.
Overall the story is as close to perfect as perfect can be and achieves more in 148 episodes then most shonen are able to get after 400+ episodes. Also, the music/OST is phenomenal. The opening is super motivating and catchy. It is also one of the few japanese songs I can sing completely. The endings are really beautiful and bring you feels after an episode has ended. The OST is just as amazing and I would really recommend to buy it if you can. It is just that great!
The manga hasn't ended yet (and won't end any time soon because of hiatus) but the point where the anime ended couldn't be a more perfect moment to end the series on. I think that if this all we will when it comes to the anime, then I can live with that.",10
"
                HunterxHunter is without doubt the best anime I've ever seen. I'm sure most people would expect this masterpiece to be a kid's show due to its cover, however it is one of the deepest animes. It showcases recklessness, courage and sacrifices. There was no boring moment, every scene contributed to the protagonist's ultimate goal.

                First of all, this was the first anime series that I've watched! and to be new in the world of anime, it was quite daring for me to choose an anime with over 148 episodes! but I never regretted it! I still remember last year when I marathoned HXH and couldn't stop watching it until the end.  Hunter x Hunter was definitely one of my favorite anime of all time! it was the reason why I started getting addicted to anime and the reason why I am writing this review right now. 
Over a year has passed and I've watched so many anime but
                  HXH still gives me the chills and feels whenever I try to recall it. 
I don't really have words to describe how HXH is! The ending left me in awe and loneliness. AWE because of the journey and adventure that took me to another world and Loneliness because it has ended. 
but I never felt more satisfied after watching it, that 148 episodes is worth it! Iam happy that my time was not wasted and I know after some time I will rewatch this whole series again.",10

                Hunter x Hunter is perhaps one of the most beloved anime of all time, frequently cited by both casuals and critics as a shonen masterpiece. The purpose of this review is to explain why I, just another anime watcher, believe Hunter x Hunter to be an outstanding anime worthy of all the praise it receives. I will be shedding light on all of the praiseworthy features of this anime, but I'll also make sure to include some of the flaws and shortcomings. As with any other series, it's not flawless. Onto the review:
To begin, one thing that I find really distinguishes Hunter x Hunter from
                  other series in the genre is how Hunter x Hunter handles its story arcs. Every arc in Hunter x Hunter is distinct. This is owed to a multitude of factors. 
Firstly, Hunter x Hunter doesn't have a fixed main character. Yes, Gon technically speaking is the main character, but despite being the main character he's not central to everything that happens. In Yorknew City, for example, Kurapika takes the lead. In the Chimera Ant arc, he's just one part of a large scale conflict. Secondly, every arc in Hunter x Hunter has a unique concept. One moment the main characters are participating in a tournament on a skyscraper, the other moment they've been isekai'd into a video game. Each arc feels drastically different. Hunter x Hunter avoids feeling repetitive and formulaic because of this. It always feels fresh. Thirdly, tone switches are recurrent. Hunter x Hunter is able to transition from a light hearted shonen adventure to a psychological drama or crime thriller in the blink of an eye. It's able to traverse the entire spectrum rather than sticking to one side.
One of Hunter x Hunter's major lessons is to enjoy the detours. This fits incredibly well with the format of the anime, because in a way, every arc is a detour. There's no real sense of progress in a conventional sense. Hunter x Hunter is known for being unpredictable, subverting expectations and tropes, and delivering anti climaxes. Some would argue that the anime and arcs feel disjointed for this reason, but I personally like how the arcs transition from one extreme to another (this goes back to the tone switch I mentioned earlier). 
Another thing to know about Hunter x Hunter is that while some of the story is definitely planned out, there's also a fair amount of improvisation. It's not like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood where the story was all planned out from the beginning. That being said, it's not like things come out of nowhere. Plot points and arcs are properly set up for the most part, with few exceptions. Hunter x Hunter is a vehicle for Yoshihiro Togashi to do whatever he feels like. It's a sharp contrast from Yu Yu Hakusho, where Togashi was held back from doing what he wanted. In Hunter x Hunter, he's achieved his freedom. To me, it's awesome to read or watch a story in which the author has no limitations or boundaries. When the author is having fun, I tend to feel that from the story and it helps my enjoyment as well.
Hunter x Hunter's characters are written in a realistic way, which is refreshing to see. In Hunter x Hunter, you can find some really emotional and organic character arcs. The characters for the most part avoid falling into stereotypes and archetypes. One thing that I particularly like about Togashi is that he doesn't fall into the common pitfall of shonen writers which is to give a flashback or backstory to every character. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with using flashbacks, but sometimes they're just really overdone and formulaic. Flashbacks are used sometimes in Hunter x Hunter, but I almost always find them to be meaningful and poignant. Some of the most captivating and fan favorite characters in Hunter x Hunter such as Chrollo and Hisoka are characters who we barely know anything about. It's through meaningful character interactions, dialogue, symbolism, personality, and moral ambiguity that Hunter x Hunter is able to imbue such a level of nuance, complexity, and depth to its characters.
The Nen power system in Hunter x Hunter is probably one of the most acclaimed power systems in battle shonen, and for good reason too. The power system is magnificent for one main reason: attention to detail. Everything from the different abilities created by Nen, the categorizations, the aura system, the idea of restriction and pledge, and Nen after death are explained really well. It's also very balanced and addresses another pitfall of battle shonen, which is power inflation. In Hunter x Hunter, a power hierarchy certainly does exist, but it's not concrete. A weaker Nen user can put up a fight against a stronger Nen user through a match up advantage, a creative use of his/her abilities, or through restrictions which can increase the power of his/her Nen. This is all shown masterfully in the Chimera Ant arc, in which the humans have to face the monstrous and all-powerful genetically gifted Chimera Ants. Despite being weaker, the humans are able to put up a fight through all of what I just mentioned, which goes to show how flexible the power scaling and power system can be.
Oh, and did I mention that Hunter x Hunter is amazingly produced? A 148 episode long anime where the animation is crisp and high quality throughout its entire run? Only two filler episodes when compared to the gazillion of filler episodes that tend to plague long running shonen? An incredible OST that ranges from light hearted adventurous tunes to jaw dropping orchestral pieces such as Kingdom of Predators? It's the same composer as Death Note. 'Nuff said.
With all that said and done, no series is perfect. Hunter x Hunter certainly does have its flaws just like everything else out there. One problem with the anime is its episode 1. An important figure is left out of the anime for some reason, even though he made an appearance in the 1999 version and in the manga. This figure is very important and makes an appearance later in the anime, so unfortunately the impact of his reappearance isn't felt in the 2011 adaptation since he wasn't introduced in the first episode. Another problem is the length of the Chimera Ant arc. This is perhaps my favorite arc in Hunter x Hunter, but simply put, it's not for everyone. The arc takes up more than a third of the whole anime, so if the arc is not to someone's liking, it can ruin the entire anime for them. Another flaw is that some Nen powers are not explained very well in the anime. The manga tends to explain them in the chapter title pages, which the anime doesn't adapt. The final major flaw is obviously the fact that Hunter x Hunter is incomplete. The anime offers a fairly bittersweet conclusion that while not a bad place to end, leaves more to be desired. 
At heart, Hunter x Hunter is not flawless or perfect, but it doesn't need to be. It's a long running shonen after all, so there's a lot of room for errors. The pros far outweigh the cons as far as I'm concerned, and the pros are undoubtedly magnificent. Hunter x Hunter to me is a special series and an anime that is worthy of all the praise it receives on this site and many others. It's a true masterpiece.",10

                I'm re-watching this anime for the third time now and it really never loses its charm. Easily my all time favourite anime, and here's why.
Story -- 10 /10
the one thing the story of this anime does so well is starting off simple without overwhelming us but leaving so much room to develop into something complex, morally conflicting, emotional, and deeply intense. The pacing is great considering the length of the anime. although the smaller infrequent arcs do feel a little slower, they're still entertaining and meaningful nonetheless. This show really doesn't wast any time but also doesn't shove everything at you a once. the comedy
                  feels more endearing than anything and mostly comes out when the characters' bonds develop. it isn't just there for no reason, they really feel like moments the characters will remember.
from the get go the anime feels like one huge adventure. young Gon sets out to become a hunter in his overall goal to find the father that abandoned him at birth. Every arc feels a step closer to that goal, which in itself becomes more and more weighted as we learn more about the characters involved
Characters -- 10 /10
Gon is an excellent protagonist. He often feigns being simple minded but is quick thinking, charming, thoughtful, and actually strong. he also doesn't start out as a loser or someone with no talent like most, which most protagonists do to give room for growth. Yet this anime reminds us that there is so much more to a person than just ""am i strong?"" and ""am i persistnent?"".  he's highly gifted from the start which is usual and refreshing for this genre, but his young age really balances him out. he learns to become maturer and more considerate as the show goes on and he only really gets more loveable. 
The friendship between Gon and the eventual best friend he makes during the Hunter Exam, Killua, feels so real, innocent, and genuine, it really contrasts with how dark the show can be at times but doesn't feel over done and cheesy at all. It's clear how well the two's differences and similarities compliment one another, and the moments they look out for the other feel very real and motivated. Not only that but there's a layer of rivalry between them as they try to develop their skills at the same rate despite Killua's years worth of experience ahead of Gon. The writers keep all of this in mind and you can see these smaller things take relevance and build up.
These main two characters aside, there are far too many memorable characters to count, and none of them ever feel like just ""the good guy"" or ""the bad guy"". someone who was a villain in the first arc comes back three arcs later aligned with our protagonist, while at some point you'll question to what extent the good guys really are doing the right thing. Characters don't get forgotten in this show, each one counts and many have compelling stories behind them who sometimes feel like the main characters of certain arcs.
art --  9/10
i was incredibly stupid at first in that i put off watching this anime for over a year just because Gon's hair annoyed me at first and made the anime seem childish. WROnG. Msot character designs are memorable and creative, very fitting of each of their personalities at the very least, and they do actually change outfits from time to time which is a much appreciated touch. 
i have no complaints on the animation, but like with most it does have room for improvement. However the show really will not let you down when it comes to fight scenes. They're brilliantly and fluidly animated, a really pleasure to witness. 
sound -- 9 /10 
personally i loved the soundtrack, it was really memorable and rarely felt out of place, although i must admit that some of it sounds a little odd and jarring which is my only complaint. Some of the OSTs are really intense and create such a strong sense of atmosphere, and are never misused. The opening song remains throughout the whole show and it becomes a great way to get you fired up for each episode, and quickly you'll find yourself knowing the lyrics for for word. the ending songs weren't my thing though, but they were never bad.
music aside, the voice acting is what really makes this show. each actor does a superb job of filling characters with life and personality, no complaints at all. The casting was just spot on.
overall + enjoyment -- 1000 /10
i mean it should be clear a this point how much i enjoyed this show. it'll keep you wanting to watch more and more and is good to watch either over time or to binge away (i've done both..).",10
"
                Very engaging
The anime overall is very engaging. The story never fades or bores and there are almost no fillers. The yorknew arc is the highlight and deserves a 11/10. Personally, I felt it got a little weird and boring in the Chimera ant arc, which is why I rate it 9 overall. The characters are all just amazing, especially Hisoka. At the end of the series, you'll be left begging for more from each character. Sadly, the mangaka is suffering with back problems and hence the manga development is slow :(. Still, that shouldn't prevent anyone from watching the existing series.

                First Of All ! This is A totally Unbiased Review ! Hunter X Hunter In my opinion (No offence to other Anime Fans/Shounen Lovers) is the best Series i watched.
1)
Considering The Storyline and other Aspects of what you expect from an anime is Filled like infinite Honey in HXH.
2)
At First you might think like it is totally Kiddish , thou after a few episodes you'll be like holy shit dude , That is totally Dark Anime , Anyways , then it turns out to be a tournment type anime , then it turns out to be a crime thriller and many more.You would never find
                  the storyline to be Dragging , i mean you're watching a 148 episode anime guys, you would want something different each arc. This is what makes HXH a unique ! 
3)
Talking about the Animation Aspects.
The Animation in 2011 one is Amazing !
Mad House has Spent a Lot on this and it turned out to be amazingly executed.
4)
Its Ratio of Episode Dragging Storyline is very low .Only 2 Filler episodes,and that also are recaps.
5)
You Will Enjoy it and i assure that , Amazing Fight Sequences, i Loved all of them .
6)
HXH also Changed the way i saw the world ! I learnt a lot ! Quotes , Determination and Love are present in utmost level .",10

                I finished Hunter x Hunter in around two weeks, maybe less.  It was so enjoyable on every level that I just kept burning through the episodes.  When describing it to a friend, I compared it to eating candy; highly enjoyable and easy to consume in mass amounts.
The story was engaging. The main characters were easy to root for (honest, likable, true to their convictions, strong but not invincible). I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. It was action packed, funny when it wanted to be, while still addressing dark themes with serious consequences.
Initially I was hesitant to start it because of
                  the large amount of episodes and a cover picture that made it look like it was directed at children.  But with the score being as high as it was, and also since it was completed, I relented and gave it a shot. That was a great decision because it ended up being one of the best/favorite anime I've ever seen. So much so, that I'm scared that it's ruined other shounen anime for me. I've started a few other series since then (D.Gray-man, Fairy Tail) and while I'm sure these series are good, they haven't been able to draw me in the way Hunter did.
I only wish there was more. There were a few side stories and character arcs that were left open ended. I know the manga is still ongoing (aside from some extended hiatuses) so maybe someday we'll get some more. 
I loved this anime.",10
"
                This anime has taught me something, well more like it solidified something I already knew. Don't judge a book by it's cover, or in this case, an anime. When I was going through the list of top rated anime I saw this and thought, that looks strange, the art is weird, eh *keeps scrolling* funny how I had the same initial approach for Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (Both HXH and FMAB are my top 2 favourite animes but in actual fact, HXH takes the cake) 
Yes this anime is reasonably long, if you're worried about it being boring and long seriously don't. You won't want it
                  to end and when it does, you'll be sad it did. I feel that rewatching this will give me great pleasure in the future.
Now for the story. It's about the main character (who is 12 at the start) called Gon who's father left him to become a hunter when he was a baby. The story is essentially about Gon trying to find his father with the help of his 3 most notable friends (Kurapika, Leorio and Killua).
Yes Killua gets his own section. 
Warning: You may find yourself obsessed with this character who is adorable, hot, badass and unusually muscled for a twelve year old? Like seriously, no 12 year old has that amount of muscle even with a family like Killua's. (But really, who's complaining?) 
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime due to its amazing storyline, intriguing characters and amazing opening that never gets old. If you watch this you will not regret it.",10
"
                I didn't want to review this without watching the entire show, however the lack of enjoyment I've had due to how plastic and boring the world-building and writing is made me drop the show early (episode 79). I also fully admit some of my unenjoyment stems from my expectation that this was an adventure show about searching ""for lost treasures in uncharted territories"" like stated on the MAL synopsis, rather than a typical shonuen. However, my main complaint is not that the show didn't fit to how I expected it, but how plastic the world felt and how everything in it existed only for the
                  plot. There are a number of examples of this, most of which I'm omitting for the sake of keeping this short. Contains minor spoilers.
1: Early in the show some of the main characters interact with a shape-shifting creature. This made me really excited due to how wondrous and mysterious the world felt, as you followed a child leaving his island for the first time. But then, only a couple episodes later, the show introduces another shape-shifting creature, and is utilized in an almost identical way. And then the next actual special (not just a big predator) creature is another one that is central to the plot. No creature in this world seems to exist, except to serve the plot.
2: Every almost every 'villain' in this show seems to either have no motivation or extremely basic motivation. The main offender of this a thief group that is first introduced as a group that massacred a village of people and have killed thousands upon thousands of people. Why? When actually shown, they never even seem like villains. Yes, a villain should have human elements, but this is a group that has literally committed genocide. Why? Do they need money for something? It's never explained in any way, they just seems to exist so one character can have motivation for revenge, existing solely for the plot.
3: The MC, Gon, has the main motivation to find his father, following his footsteps to become a Hunter. And throughout the show he goes up to adults and cheerfully tells them he just wants to find his father (who clearly states he doesn't want to meet Gon). And not one of them tells him that maybe he'll be disappointed when he finds his deadbeat father. And all while the show keeps painting his father as this great, powerful Hunter. It was when the show then proceeded to make a light-hearted joke about Gon's father refusing to meet Gon, despite him completing the test left for him, that I truly started hating this show. Gon's search for his deadbeat father is of course just another poorly written plot to give him a vague motivation to become stronger.
TL:DR
World and characters felt like they were plastic, solely existing for the plot.",4
"
                I'll start with story. I rate it 8/10, as ""Very Good"". There was a clear sign of over extending and monetizing in the longest arc of the story. It really let me down. So much that I stopped watching the show for two whole days. Build up and ending were clearly the point of the show, and the extra to make the show profitable was acceptable, although not that amusing.
I was not blown away by the art, something you should expect from a show not investing it's entire budget on visuals. However, the visuals of this show were remarkably good as far as the standard
                  goes. I rate it 9/10, as ""Great"" it didn't miss a thing.
Opening was catchy, the third ending was one of the best pump up's I've heard and the soundtrack was excellent and fitting. Voice acting was top notch on main characters, but lacked a bit moving further from them. It wasn't something that made me cry or laugh out loud though, and either way we can agree the soundscape isn't the reason this anime is as great as it is. 8/10, ""Very Good"" Didn't hold the show back by any reason worth mentioning.
Characters were something Hunter x Hunter was outstanding with. So much that if they could keep the soul of these main characters, the story wouldn't matter at all. Incredible, and worthy of 10/10, ""Outstanding""
I watched the show in eight days. First four days I was blown off by this show. The next two days made me realize how much time of the day I was spending with this show, and made me stop for two days, until I watched the rest of it practically non stop. This show is best you can get off of the 100+ episode animes, as far as constant enjoyment is concerned. 9/10.
This show was a blast. I would recommend it to most of the folk. The gap between 9 and 10 in overall score should be decided by personal preference, and is not a thing you should be looking at. For me, this show is a really solid 9.",9
"
                (Spoilers incoming) Just to preface this, I never thought I'd have a favorite anime until I watched Hunter X Hunter. 
Story: 10/10. HxH pulls off the most versatile plots I've ever seen. In one arc, we'll be immersed in a tournament arc watching Gon and Killua developing their powers throughout interesting battles. In another, we'll have a high intensity crime thriller where Kurapika chases down an intriguing band of thieves for revenge. Or, we'll just be thrown into a high stakes war between humanity and a band of mutant creatures, the Chimera Ants; yet while we might expect a showcase of battles and war, we
                  also get a masterful handling of themes dealing with the nature of humanity, mixed with some of the greatest character development in fictional history.
While HxH's arcs seem to be disjoint from one another in purpose and focus, they all serve to enhance our characters and their motivations, as well as introduce equally intriguing and relevant characters along the way. No one character steals the spotlight for all of HxH; rather, the world of HxH is the true star, and the characters, albeit interesting forces in their own right, also serve as catalysts to introduce us to the amazing situations and challenges within the world itself. HxH manages to reinvent itself with every arc, while still maintaining a firm grasp on what it wants to be.
It should be said that the battle system underlying HxH, Nen, is perhaps the most structured and consistent battle system in shonen. Many shonen suffer from the problems of no tangible power ceiling or power creep, thereby losing a sense of how strong its characters are as the series progresses and not presenting enough tension within a situation, i.e. if a stronger opponent comes, all you need to do is punch harder and acquire more energy to win. HxH's Nen system turns battles into a test of cunning, strategy and wit, where victory relies on what abilities you have and how you use them rather than how hard you can kick or throw an energy blast. As one of the characters puts it himself, it's foolish to think you know who'll win in a battle among Nen users, because such a battle relies more on just physical prowess.
Lastly, HxH is probably the most original shonen to date, subverting our expectations of shonen tropes. Togashi most definitely adheres to the philosophy that ""It's all about the journey, not the destination"". Admittedly, each arc ends in a rather anticlimactic way, so much so we end up asking ""What was all that for?"". Yet that's exactly the point; what we expected we wanted to see wasn't necessarily what made the experience. The journey we took to get there, the people we met, the characters that grew along the way; all of that is what truly mattered at the end, and Togashi masterfully showcases this sentiment in HxH.
Art: 10/10. For a long running shonen, HxH is simply phenomenal. It offers the most consistent, high quality animation and artwork in every episode. There was never a dip in quality, and every fight was of the highest calibre. Madhouse really outdid themselves here.
Sound: 10/10. HxH exhibits one of the greatest soundtracks to date in modern anime. Each arc has its own set of OSTs, and the OSTs range from reminiscent of classical opera to high-intensity, thrilling action music. The voice acting in HxH is also phenomenal, featuring a versatile cast that are known for many other big roles.
Character: 10/10. Aside from the interesting situations and environments we encounter, the characters themselves are perhaps the strongest element within the show. Most characters in HxH offer something new and refreshing to the show, without adhering to the typical shonen stereotypes. What is truly great about these characters, however, is how organic and realistic they are; whenever they act, it doesn't feel like they're by-the-book shonen characters doing the same thing countless other such characters have done before. for example, Gon might try to protect his friends and save others, but he'll just as easily threaten someone's life to get what he wants; he isn't like other protagonists we've seen, where he forgives an enemy just because he's the 'good guy'. Togashi shows us that his characters are people like us, and they can't uphold an idealistic worldview in every situation they face. 
Where Togashi shines the most is in his crafting of his villains, and let me tell you, the antagonists in HxH are some of the best I've seen in anime to date. Meruem, my favorite anime villain of all time, represents a gold standard for character development in terms of one who transforms from a sadistic animal to a being that exhibits humanity; Hisoka is a being of pure unpredictability and intrigue, a bizarre entity that can be either friend or foe, and thereby keeps the audience on their toes unable to guess what he'll do next; Chrollo is a rather reserved yet determined man, putting forth a strong philosophy of the Spider while not knowing what he truly wants (and his powers reflect this, as he steals the abilities of others, perhaps in an attempt to find himself?). Of course, not every villain in HxH is this profound (Genthru, for instance, isn't a bad villain but he's a pretty stereotypical variant of the sadistic psychopath), but most of the antagonists in HxH will intrigue you, even more so than the 'heroes' of the show. While our heroes offer complexity to the narrative, the villains just as much serve to complement our heroes and offer a novel take on the themes present within the arc. Meruem, for instance, parallels Gon's own journey through the CAA, and both characters together really showcase the potential of humanity to cause great destruction and great evolution. There is a symbiosis between the character's own development and the progression of the arcs, and it's safe to say a character at the start of an arc won't necessarily be the same person he was at the end of that same arc.
Enjoyment: 10/10. From start to finish, I enjoyed HxH immensely. The first few episodes do little to showcase how brilliant the anime becomes, and although I might be one of the few who actually enjoyed the first arc, after episode 30 or so, it's pretty hard to not be interested in the events that ensue as new elements are added to the story and the narrative transitions from its initially bright overtones to a more dark, yet intriguing atmosphere. Each arc also offers something novel within, from the arc's plot to the characters introduced, to how the already established characters grow and develop. 
An especially important point to commend HxH for is in how protagonists don't gain special treatment just because they're special characters in the show. Many times, we see Gon and Killua face defeat, and even by the end of HxH, they aren't even comparable to some of the upper mid-tier to high-tier hunters. Because of this, we never know when Gon and Killua will face defeat, and when they do, it makes for an incredible potential for growth and development (especially in the CAA). 
Overall: 10/10. HxH is a must-watch for shonen fans, one of the few anime that isn't afraid to break traditional stereotypes to showcase something new and different. From the heroes to the villains, from being a show about exciting fights and great powers to a show delving into mature themes and ideas, HxH excels in every degree. This isn't to say the show isn't without flaws; as mentioned before, the first arc is perhaps the weakest of the whole show. Also, the Chimera Ant Arc has caused quite a stir among those who've watched the show. Many consider this arc the best shonen has to offer, but some put it down due to its slower style pacing and less action, more introspection take on things. To each their own, but I think it's important to say HxH doesn't try to be a generic shonen, and that's what makes it truly special; within the CAA, we see Togashi try to subvert our expectations of battle shonen by blending the lines between 'good' and 'bad', and crafting villains that change along with our heroes, such that the arc is perhaps a literary achievement in developing characters and situations in an organic, novel way. 
When you finish HxH, you'll be left wanting more, and unfortunately, this might not happen. Togashi is known for taking very long hiatuses, and although the current arc in the manga has the potential to be one of the best HxH has to offer, it's not certain that it'll be finished any time soon. Yet with what we have, I can say for certain HxH offers more than enough to stand out as one of the best of its time, a thrilling adventure focused not only on being the best shonen it can be, but also a heartwarming, fascinating tale of heroes, villains, and the intriguing world of Hunters. The show itself puts forth a quote that explains the HxH experience perfectly:
“You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want.”",10
"
                Master of puppets I’m pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can’t see a thing
Just call my name, ‘cause I’ll hear you scream
Master
Master ...

Well, after watching this anime, I was kind of confused, because it obviously deserved 10/10, but other shows that I scored as 10s were not as good, and down-grading all scores was not an option. That's why let's say that I gave it 10.9999.../10.
Okay, I'll try to keep this as much as I can abstract and spoiler-free. Story in HxH is very unpredictable and extraordinary. It's kind of like Game of Thrones, nobody is safe. It means that even if you have been training all your entire life and other people consider your being one of the strongest, there might be chance that somewhere, sometime, someone is born with talents that already surpass your abilities. Or you may be super-strong and break stones with your head, but somebody can outsmart you and, for example, blow you to pieces. That means that there's no such state as being 100% invulnerable one-punch man, you can only struggle for life in this world. And that looks damn fair, doesn't it?
And what's the story about? Well, I could say that it's about love and hate. And crime and punishment. Also loyalty and betrayal. Life and death. Religion and human spirit. Cruelty and forgiveness. Happiness and sorrow. Recklessness and forethought. Humanity and nature. Parents love. And all these things are not hidden behind some obscurity and understatements. It's literally being thrown at you face, you just have to listen. All the emotions are in their extreme forms, not at some half-assed extent. Remember that feeling from Attack on Titan that titans give: the fear of something unbeatable and inevitable. And this show gives it in much, much greater extent. If you haven't seen this show, all this paragraph may look non-sense to you, but after watching I believe you can find examples of all my words.
Art is great, it looks and feels new and polished, but with original characters designs that may look childish. Don't be fooled but that, that doesn't affect storytelling in any way.
Soundtrack in HxH is simply outstanding. OPs and EDs are catchy songs, while BGM is mostly classical orchestra of very high quality. Oh, and there's Mozart. If he's not good enough then I don't know.
Oh, and there's character development. Yes, really. I won't say anything more, because, you know, spoilers. Avoid spoilers about this show at any cost. Don't even read reviews, close this tab and don't return until you've seen it.
Overall, the show is easy to watch and good for marathon. Starting as happy adventure, it evolves into intellectual and tense drama. Even considering not-finished state of manga, anime finale left me satisfied and the show feels complete. Made with love and care, it's really one the best shows ever.
P.S. I wanted to have some good quote as an epigraph, but was afraid of giving a spoiler. And, after having some thought, I remembered this song that can make some associations for those who have seen the series, but doesn't say anything to others. That's it.",10

                Damn Near Perfect
You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want. - Ging ""when not being a horrible father"" Freecss
Hunter x Hunter is an outstanding show that deserves it's spot on the 'Top 5 Anime' list on this website. The animation was gorgeous. Mad House puts love into their work and it shows in Hunter. The characters are lovable and you care about them. Every main character is amazing. The show will have you laugh because of the well written humor and tear up because people you care about will die. Just
                  the sight of Gon tearing up will pull at your heart because you know him as having the personality of a happy puppy.  When this show is at it's peak, it is a literal 11/10. I binged about 80 episodes in 3 days because I had time off and that is how I chose to spend my time. 
The series doesn't have one great story. The series is full of great stories. I loved everyone's story and what their plans are. I love the execution of the stories. Kurapika losing his mind when seeing the Scarlet Eyes was heartbreaking. The cocktail of anger and depression is felt by the people that watch this scene. The voice acting was top-notch and conveyed human emotions perfectly. 
This show has done something no other show has ever done. I loved the training arc! Yeah, I personally hate those things, but the main training arc alone was better than most other complete series. If there was an award ceremony held by yours truly; Hunter would win the ""Holy Shit You Entertained Me During A Training Arc And No One Has Ever Done That In The History Of Forever And Midg3tLuv Is Impressed"" award.
The only thing stopping this show from being rated 10/10 is a block of about 30 episodes in the Chimera Ant arch. It felt like the show was catching up to the manga and they pulled the emergency break and brought the pace to a screeching halt. There were numerous ass-pulls that were infuriating. Anthropomorphic animals being born with clothes that has plastic/metal on them, while being in a country that doesn't allow those things, is asinine. There was horrible character development for the bad guys in that arc. I have seen Gungi boards in my nightmares and I refused to go back to sleep because I saw enough of that board in one large block. That horrible drawn out ""development"" of Meruem is disappointing. No one cared about the Koala, Octopus, Crawfish, Snake with sunglasses, furry, or any of those characters introduced around that time. This is a major flaw in an otherwise damn near perfect show.
The show ended at a good time. The main goal of the show, Gon finding Ging, was completed. There are more stories that need to be finished, but that will never happen. If Yoshihiro gets off his ass and decides he wants to finish what he started, I will gladly pick up the manga and continue my Hunter binge. I don't want to finish everything in my head like it is some sort of French film. 
This show is deserving of your time and I had no regrets powering through this amazing show.",9

                When I was recommended Hunter X Hunter, I didn't really think I would be able to get into it, but I had never been so wrong. This show is a masterpiece, and I don't believe it to be overrated at all. 
Overall, I enjoyed every arc to the fullest. While one of the arcs is drawn out for many episodes during the final few hours, in the end, it was fulfilling. 
I love the art style of this show; you can get some really funny and wholesome frames of Gon and Killua!
I love that this show keeps the same intro for all arcs. It makes
                  it more memorable, and Departure! is just amazing in general.
Most of the time, I enjoyed the characters on screen. I do wish Kurapika showed up more; I mean he is my favorite. There were some weird moments with certain characters who seemed to be predatory to kids, which caused some uncomfortable moments for me. But overall, the characters in this show are extremely well written.
Ever since watching hxh, I haven't been able to find something to watch that has the same enjoyment factor. Granted, I did finish it recently.
So yes, as you can see, I am a hxh fanatic. It is definitely worth the watch, and is one of the greatest shows to exist. Don't expect another season to come out soon though. It's been on hiatus for almost 1000 days. 
Tl;dr Watch this show, great music, great characters (some uncomfortable moments), fulfilling story, very enjoyable, worth the watch!",10
"
                An anime with a great story line. The characters are original, and the story is very unpredictable. The fighting scenes are very tactical and intelligent combined with very enjoyable action. It's like the first few seasons of Naruto, but better. The story comes in a good tempo, not like the crazy Dragon Ball Kamehameha power ups that take a whole episode. All in all, it's a master piece.
I was lucky to watch this anime when it was already finished. Just can't imagine, how I would feel after every episode when I'd to wait every week. I really really hope there's gonna be a follow up
                  season before I die!!!!!!",10

                Synopsis:
Hunter X Hunter is a story about 12-year-old Gon Freecss who has a dream: He wants to become a Hunter, a professional who travels the world and completes dangerous tasks and find his father, who disappeared long ago to become a Hunter himself. Gon signs up for the Hunter Exam, a dangerous trial where applicants prove their worth before becoming a pro Hunter. There, Gon meets an eclectic group of friends who lead him on many adventures.
Pros:
• Hunter x Hunter‘s storylines each have something different and interesting to bring to the table.
• The character relationships are delved into quite well. The drama unfolds naturally from
                  their choices.
• A light bouncy tone in the beginning that grows a bit darker with each story.
• Though Hunter x Hunter takes a while to get going, but once it does, it keeps getting better.
Cons:
• There aren't more episodes ;(",9
"
                Once I was like you… I was recommended by one of my buddies to check out Hunter x Hunter and I googled it looked at one picture of this little boy in these short shorts and I just thought to myself “HELL TO THE FUCKING NO…. IF THAT IS THE MAIN CHARACTER I AM NOT WATCHING THIS SHIT”. So when I decided to watch this anime when I was a sophomore in High School 3 years ago it was honestly one of the most difficult decisions in my life at that time. I know truly such hard suburban weaboo life decisions that could alter the
                  space time continuum. After starting this show I liked it but as I watched more and more I liked it more and more until eventually I fell in love with it and began to think it was an actual masterpiece.
Story
------
The first 25 episodes of the show are NOT a good representation as the show as a whole. This is because with each different arc there is almost like a shift in the shows genre or style. The first arc is definitely the most lighthearted of all the arcs in the show and with each arc it seems to get just darker and darker to the point you’ll think to yourself “Holy shit, how did the show come to this? This is royally fucked”. This is one of the first of many things that separate from your average Shounen Jump series. Although the premise for the story is Gons embarking on this journey to become a hunter and finding out what’s so special about the profession that his father left him for. There are six story arcs, the first of which is hunter exams (which inspired the chunin exams in the original Naruto). The following is one of your classic battle shounen fighting tournament arcs nothing too special about it. Then you’ve got a crime thriller esque art, virtual reality game setting, and even a war. I want to reiterate the point that with almost every arc there feels like a shift in the genre, and the shifts are so drastic in my opinion that for me at some points I even forgot this show was supposed to be a battle shounen .This show is 148 episodes and I consider it to be a slow burn and if by the 60th episode mark if you’ve made it that far and you still aren’t enjoying it, I don’t think you ever will. The pace of the show is generally fast paced till the Chimera arc where is slows down quite a lot, for me this didn’t really take away anything from the show since that is by far my favorite arc of the series but I’ve had discussions with people who’ve thought it dragged on too long. I think there’s only two recap episodes in the span of the 148 episodes and there is no filler, I REPEAT A BATTLE SHOUNEN LONGER THAN 100 EPISODES THAT HAS NO FILLER. YESSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! One of my main problems with series like Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail and One Piece are the amount of fillers that usually bore me half to death. Also Hunter x Hunter was a big influence on other series, specifically Naruto which drew elements from the Hunter Exams, Phantom Troupe and Kurapika’s eyes and back story directly from the manga. If you don’t believe me look for the dual-interview that Kishimoto and Togashi did a while back where Togashi said that Kishimoto came to him for a lot of advice on Naruto when he started writing it, and in my opinion the best parts of Naruto are the parts where you can tell Togashi was a big influence.
OK, I finally want to take the chance to talk about what sets this apart from the rest of battle shounen and battle anime in general. Bullshit power-ups are very rare and you’ll constantly find our main cast being overwhelmed and not being able to typically overcome their enemies when they are overwhelmed. Gon, the main protagonist of the serious is rarely the main focus of the arcs and will often be sidelined to a more supporting role and most people wouldn’t think it works but it definitely works for this series. I’ll reiterate this point later but it gives us a chance to focus on a lot of the supporting characters that are probably this series biggest strength and something that I believe this series does better than any other. If you aren’t a big fan of watching the main characters be the underdog most of the time then you might not like this series, but for what it’s worth I’d still give it a shot. Also the form the actual fights and battle in this series are much different than your typical fights and battle in shounens. Usually the characters will look at the battle from a strategic angel and try to use their abilities and knowledge to defeat their opponents with their smarts unlike the usual shounen trope defeating them by having more power. Also Nen is probably one of the most interesting and diverse powers that I’ve seen used in a shounen; each character who can use Nen develops their own unique Nen abilities and it’s really interesting to see how they orient that into combat or deceiving others. 
Art
----
Probably one of the things that people find as the biggest turnoff for this series is our main characters look. As you can tell originally I too had an issue with Gon’s design and would call him such words as “Gay” and “Stupid” because of his design to rationalize my not watching the series. I find that most people before watching the show suffer through the same ignorance that I once did but I eventually got past this and it saddens me a bit that people won’t partake in something I consider such a masterpiece now because the main character looks “Gay” and “Stupid”. But for those people who are being very superficial about this masterfully created world should just give it a shot and not take a book by its cover. Other than Gon’s character designs a lot of the characters look pretty original and are refreshing from your typical Battle Shounen character design. In some of the characters designs you can see a nod to the author of the Hunter x Hunter manga previous work another very famous manga/anime series Yu-Yu Hakusho . With this series the art style certainly grows on you and maybe like me once you’re finished with the series you will be in love with the art style just like me. It’s a very simple art style and I can see how some would find this a turnoff. 
On the subject of animation, the animation for this series is surprisingly amazing. You can’t usually say that for long running battle shounen series but Hunter x Hunter actually seems to get better animation as series progresses. The action seems look really good and the visuals will never disappoint.
Sound
-------
Overall I think HxH (2011) has a pretty good soundtrack with some amazing songs but definitely during the start it suffers from a misuse of OST that I think can be a little off-putting sometimes. I thought the voice acting was really excellent, a couple of really minor characters bad obnoxious voices too. But I think if you’ve seen the anime you’d agree they the voices fit very well with almost all of the characters
Characters
-------------
The characters are probably what this series does best. Togashi intentionally made Gon a pretty generic and bland main character so you can focus on all of the amazing side characters he’s created. In my opinion the antagonists aka the villains in this show are some of the best villains ever created in an anime. Meruem? Hisoka? The Phantom Troupe? Need I say more? Sometimes you’ll be sympathizing for the antagonists and rooting for them to win. Togashi’s writing is so genius that one of the antagonists I had been completely appalled and disgusted by him in one episode and in another I was bawling in empathy for him. Also something Hunter x Hunter seems to do differently than any other battle shounen is instill a sense of fear of loss in us for the characters, we know very well that Togashi is brutal and though so far no main characters have died they’ve been very close. Togashi even once stated in an article when asked what would happen in the end to Kurapika and the Phantom Troupe that…… Spoiler alert…… They will all die! Really hope he was just joking around there and if he isn’t :(.
Overall
--------
I’m definitely a Hunter x Hunter fanboy, haven’t been one for too long but in 2012 I fell in love with the series. I have no problem calling it my favorite series and the biggest complaint for people is the first three episodes or rather the first arc which can be sort of a slow start and a poor representation of the series as a whole. Then there’s the slight misuse of OST at some points. I don’t consider this a negative but also there is the change of pace into a much slower one throughout the Chimera Ant Arc which I believe most fans of the series actually rather enjoyed like myself but I’ve seen some people complain about it. Other than rather small negatives I think what sets it apart from other battle shounen is its use of strategy and skill, ability to actually make most characters including the main cast to feel endangered, superb villains which almost seem to get more development than the main cast, animation quality that actually gets better opposed to worse over the span of a long running series, and a story that with every arc is new and refreshing and could be considered a change of genre. These are so masterfully executed in Hunter x Hunter that I really don’t have a problem calling it a masterpiece. So that’s how I justify giving it a 10/10, while no series is perfect this seems to be the one closest too it in my opinion. 
MERRY CHRISTMASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!",10

                Great show. First anime I've watched. I find it hard to get in any other series now, lol. Third time watching it (first time with brother, second with friend, now is third time with another friend). Every time, I notice new things that just make me love the show even more. How I can feel so much... emotion about a show, I don't know. But that's Hunter x Hunter. 
There are surely other people that have gone super in-depth about everything good about HxH. So, I don't feel the need to do that (nor particularly want to). Just know that this show is great. Very
                  special in its own way. If you are one to think the first 37 or so episodes aren't great, just keep watching until the end of the fourth arc (PT (trying not to spoiler)). If by then, you still aren't impressed, it would probably be best to stop. However, if you feel like you enjoy the show, but not head-over-heels, just keep watching. It's great, the second last arc is super special. 
Pretty much everything that consists a show is great in Hunter x Hunter (eg. characters, writing, style, story, etc.). I can only see very few people getting into hunter x hunter then willingly stop. The first 2 arcs aren't even that bad, just fleshing out characters and setting up a base. Lots of very unexpected shit happens, don't think that everything will be anything close to the first arc (oh my have I gotten quite a ride). 
Ok, I think I have finished. Would recommend to anyone, jesus this is a great show.",10
"
                HxH has a ridiculously high rating! Here, on MAL it is over 9.0, the anime itself is described as ""mature shonen"", ""dark shounen"" and ""shonen/seinen hybrid"", and, judging by amount of reviews, praised by many. Mishappen to believe this information, I decided to watch the series fully, by each arc my investment into the series went so low to the point that I just stopped caring. The last two arcs broke me completely. This review contains only SOME ridiculous points of the show.
1. GON'S BIGGEST FLAW
    or
    DEATHS AND MURDERS CAUSE NO EMOTIONAL IMPACT ON THE MAIN CHARACTER MOST
                  OF THE TIME
Gon grew up on the isolated island with his aunt as caregiver, who is definitely not abusive, Gon himself never had traumatic experiences, there are really no premises to his mental strength or extreme coping mechanisms and at the same time it is never explained or reflected by Gon in any way (if we do not count his reckless and fearless actions), making him look like some mentally indestructible Terminator in the first series. His first signs of fear were shown only when he faced Hisoka, this is the first we see his emotional crisis, but everything before that is brushed off.
No, the mention of the ""cruel and mysterious Hunter world"" does not explain anything and it seems like an excuse. How does one ignore that without any previous experience? The rest of the main cast seems to be emotionally damaged, but still Leorio does not look like a person who also has mental capacity to keep goofing around in the same manner after being so much stress. For ""mature shonen"", it is a VERY BIG FLAW. This made me unable to relate to this character for the whole series. His character does not change. Even after the last arc we cannot observe any mental agony, just like nothing happened.
2. KILLUA'S CHARACTER DESIGN
Killua is a 12 year old child of family of assassins, he went through intensive training of killing and resisting any poison. Lately we see that he knows the techniques of creating the afterimages of himself and ripping of hearts by making his fingers and growing out fangs for a short time. He also can endure the high amount of pain and voltage. His personality can characterized as dark and edgy. He joins the main cast immediately, ultimately becoming the best friend to Gon.
If you read this for the first time, this is not a joke, I am not trying to manipulate the words and definitions; this is a real main character, introduced in the first arc; this amount of information was dropped like a bomb. Dropping a lot of information is essential for this anime in general. 
3. LOTS OF INFORMATION GETS RENDERED USELESS, IS REPEATED FOR NO REASON OR SPOONFED THROUGH NARRATION
If I recall correctly, this phenomenon was the key of Arena, Greed Island and Chimera arcs.
For Arena one, it is constant repeating of different techniques of newly introduced battle system, of course the techniques were described by users of those techniques.
For Greed Island, it was an explanation of how that magic Isekai-MMORPG-Cardboard game works and of card mechanics. Intuitively, I realized that there is no point to get into this stuff, as any bush piano would be explained anyway. Of course, all information about it becomes useless after the end of the arc.
Chimera ant arc. Anybody, who watched it, remember the narrator part, that transformed the animated series to audiobook or just a book, if you watch with subtitles.
  a) Sad story of the dictator, which does not affect plot at all
  b) Killua:
      - Something is weird.
      ""Killua felt something is weird..."". 
       3 minutes of in-anime time is stretched to several episode, mostly consisting of narrated exposition. All of a sudden, there is description of everybody's feelings. 
  c) Long explanation of atomic bomb and that is a cruel invention of humanity.
  d) Relationship between villain and that girl.
Narrator is summoned in three cases:
  a) To make a sudden plot twist, because information wasn't told from the beginning
  b) To stretch time
  c) To describe something what was failed to describe directly through animation
This was THE LAZIEST EVER WRITING I ever witnessed.
4. AUTHOR EITHER TRIES TOO HARD TO MAKE CHARACTERS FIT TO THE STORY OR THROWS THEM AWAY IMMEDIATELY
This anime has lots of characters, so much that this is insane. Some appear in interval of 50-60 episodes or even more, the most outrageous is disappearing of MAIN CAST Kurapika and Leorio, considering amount of backstory they were given. Both appear in the 3rd arc, then do not show up till the end, where Kurapika has a cameo role. It is even more bizarre that in the manga Kurapika again becomes the main character while Gon and Killua mess around on their own somewhere else.
Many characters were introduced to be forgotten an instant the arc ends. It can be noted in the Chimera ant arc especially. I could not care less, when each ant started to pop up with their own story, special abilities, some of them even shown sort of mental anguish, but this is was waaay too much. The way the characters were introduced made an impression of very bad school musical. 
5. B MOVIE WITH LOTS OF REFERENCES
Considering amount of references and genre switches (deadly trials, battle tournament, criminal action, isekai-cardboard game, the invasion of aliens and politics-chase with sudden culmination of the series by final meeting of Gon's) throughout the anime, with poor execution and sudden switches, brought up in style of ""by the way, your father left you the box"" or ""by the way, teleport him to Kaito"", this whole series were like B movie with monster as cheap props (this one goes to most of the ant soldiers with terrible design).
Instead of B movie, I can give other good comparisons:
* The parody anime without comedy
* The DND game of 12 years old ADHD kids on crack
* The fever dream
* Romeo and Juliet help Anakin Skywalker to defeat Voldemort in Mortal Kombat
And one comparison from myself:
If you grew up in the third world country or in any similar environment, then you probably acknowledged with the concept of the street markets.
Be it stands, tents or stalls, they are filled with goods starting from food and ending with instruments and clothes. The latter part has quite low price and corresponding quality: clothes become raggedy way too fast, the threads are hanging out all over the place, just their appearance confirms how poorly made they are, and all of it is quite often accompanied by the attempt to reproduce the logo of some popular brand, which created some frankensteins as Abibas, Beebok, Nice, etc., though sometimes the creativity of makers goes even beyond that. I will attach the link to popular image hosting of an extreme example below.

"
                If there's a single regret I have that stands out like a sore thumb, it's the fact I didn't watch this great show sooner. Everything from the story, to the animation, to the score, to the characters is done to near perfection in the extremely varied and creative shounen known as Hunter x Hunter.
Story:
Like I mentioned earlier, the show is extremely varied. Each individual story arc takes on a different tone so everyone is sure to find something to love in the show. Even when the current tone and overall atmosphere of HxH might not be your thing, that's no issue. HxH always provides an
                  interesting situation to the characters, whether it's on the battlefield or off of it. The show is all about tactics and evaluating the situation, so there's never a truly dull moment. And the thematic elements don't feel forced or pretentious. The themes in each arc are very clearly expressed and are effectively communicated to the viewer.
Almost every character in the show feels unique. Even when some characters feel like you've seen them a trillion times before Togashi makes them either visually or individually unique. most of the time he succeeds at both. Each character responds to situations in their own special way and has their own motivations. Sometimes these motivations intertwine. For example:
Gon: To find his father and ask him why he was abandoned.
Killua: To find a purpose for himself outside of being an assassin.
How they intertwine: Killua aids in Gon finding his father while Gon gives him a purpose through their friendship,
The animation, while not the greatest I've ever seen, is still silky smooth and is extremely pleasant to look at. Madhouse really did an amazing job with the visuals. The animation never felt inconsistent in the slightest, which is a damn near astronomical feat for a show of this length. The show is visually superb and borders on legendary status in some instances.
Once again I can say this show is superb in yet another category, boasting an incredible and varied score, fitting for a show with as much variety as Hunter x Hunter. Not only does the music make the combat scenes that much more intense, it makes the nonstop exposition fly by.
While not being really all that action based, it IS a shounen and action is one of the basic fundamentals of the genre. Surprise, surprise, it's got phenomenal action sequences. Not a single fight feels the same, all are unique in some way and don't last an eternity like most of the other shounens out there with their 35 minutes of muscular dickheads screaming. I can only think of 1 or 2 fights in HxH that are longer than 15 minutes.  HxH also makes it clear that if the main characters are in battles with people a fair bit ahead of them they could die at any moment, leading to more tension than those shows where the main characters pull some op technique out of their anus.
The show as a whole is honestly a masterpiece. I couldn't really list off all of the things I found HxH accomplished extraordinarily well but this is a basic breakdown of the major parts of the show and how they were executed to near perfection. It deeply saddens me that HxH has only picked up with anime fans in the last few years, it deserves way more attention than it gets.",10

Compared to the 1999 version, this one is inferior. Why?
Because... The old story arcs that I find really intriguing, such as Hunter Exam, Heaven's Arena and Greed Island have been summarized and shortened and not given as much credit just so the anime can focus on the worst and most boring arc possible - Chimera Ant.
It's inferior, because it has all the previous story, but the new one, that makes it stand out is actually really bad. They should've just called this Hunter X Hunte: Chimera
                  Ant and have only this arc, not confuse people and have some ignore the superior 1999 version and watch the botched old arcs in HD as the only redeeming value.
Not to mention that many characters and locations look different from how they look in the manga, which are more accurately depicted in the 1999 version. 
Don't get me wrong, I don't glorify the 1999 version, it's just that the 2011 version has absolutely no redeeming values. For me it's absolutely pointless.
I would advise anyone who would want to get the most out of the Hunter X Hunter anime to watch first the 1999 version and when it finishes to watch the Chimera Arc in the 2011 version.",5

                0/10 - Don't waste your time! 
After several long weeks, finally managed to watch all the episodes of this terrible show. 
Without giving away any spoilers, I can tell you there is little substance to this show. 
This show is all over the place and the main character is a stubborn kid with no real focus on accomplishing his main goal. We are introduced to new characters throughout the entire show and none of their stories are fully flushed out. There are often times when the main story line has something interesting happening, but then for 3-4 episodes we are stuck watching random side characters
                  over think minor details. By the time we get back to the main story all the tension that kept you on the edge of your seat is gone and the resolution is often anti-climatic. 
You know a show is poorly written when they have to waste minutes and sometimes even entire episodes to actually explain why a certain action would have the consequence that it does. A good show would set up the conditions for its ""magic"" and then through action show what happens.
Example: Death Note. We are told about the rules of the notebook and then through out the show we see it put to action. The narration doesn't have to literally tell us that killing certain people will result in the protagonist being discovered as a murders. We are trusted as an audience to just know that.  In Hunter X Hunter we are held by the hands and literally told what the consequences of an action would be, nothing is left for the viewer to figure out.",1

                This was the most amazing adventure I have ever had the pleasure to watch, thank you hunter x hunter you will always remain one of the BEST anime there ever was, I couldn't ask for more of an epic story and the only thing that I wish there was more episodes.
Overall I think this anime was amazing and I'd give anything just to re-watch it and then I'd do it all over again, words can't describe how much I love this and I wish it would get more attention.
This is an over all 10/10 and if you're thinking about watching it then I can't begin
                  to describe on what your missing out on, just do it!.",10

                The best anime since dbz.
My score: 10/10
Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a really great anime because how Togashi made his fight scenes.
HxH's fight scenes are unpredictable and entertaining to watch. There are 
absolutely no fillers whatsoever. How HxH's story is so intriguing is because of how Togashi executes specific scenes into unpredictable outcomes. 
Though beating the living shit out of an opponent is more pleasing, HxH's fights is executed by Wit and Strategy; Almost never seen in an Anime and how its really unique from the others.  
Mad House studios did an excellent job re-adapting the series into an HD and how they made the choreography of most fights more engaging.",9

                *Spoiler free Review*
Its 2015. There has been so many new, popular anime's that have hit us hard in the past year. Nothing yet can quiet compare to Hunter x Hunter, and if you haven't seen it yet you're doing something completely wrong. Don't let the 148 episode length scare you from clicking on episode one. I usually refrain myself from watching anime with hundreds of episodes, but I blew through Hunter x Hunter when I watched it months back.  
This will be a basic review. Since i'm leaving out spoilers, it will be short, but generally cover everything.
Story 8/10
Enter Gon Freecss, a 12 year old boy who loves adventure. He aspires to be a Professional Hunter, like his father, who left him when he was only a small child. Growing up on Whale Island with his aunt, Gon wants to venture out and see the world. With ambition in his heart Gon sets out to partake in the ""Hunter Exam"", a series of tests that is required to become a hunter. This sets up for a good story line. As the show progresses into the deeper episodes the arc's become so much more intense, compared to what we started with. The anime never strays from the idea of ""I need to find my dad"". The arc's never get extremely off story, they're always related to finding Gon's dad in one way or another. The only negative thing, if anything, about the story line is the somewhat rushed ending. I just wished this anime was still on going.  
Art 10/10
Best art, and animation I've ever seen in an anime. Seriously, a solid 10/10.
For a shonen, good animation to support all the action is a top priority. Never once was there a sloppy few minutes that lacked detail. Everything was always 110%.
Excellent work to the studio that animated this. 
Sound 10/10
This anime had 1 theme song, ""Departure"". 
You hear it every episode, and it still doesn't get old. It's the type of theme song that just gets you pumped up and excited once you're used to it, and you grow attached to it.
All of the ending songs are extremely well done too, they usually have me watching the ending credits just to hear the music. 
When it comes to the voice actors, I don't think there could have been a better cast. Seriously, hearing some of the voices send chills down your spine. Especially the bad guys, the actors and actresses portray the characters so damn well. 
Characters 10/10
Such a wide cast of characters through out the series.  I've seen some of the best characters come from Hunter x Hunter. The main characters are extremely likeable, they express such a strong friendship, like brothers. The characters with authority seem to catch your respect, and the characters who are all about fucking shit up creep the hell out of you. Throughout the anime, characters change and develop so much in such a positive way, its simply just a joy to see these characters do their thing. 
Enjoyability 9/10
This is one hell of a good anime. It's skyrocketed in popularity since first airing, with a huge fan base which is clear to see once you start watching it. Over all, as someone who has completed the whole anime, I can say 95% of this whole anime is awesome enjoyability, 5% being minor boring parts that are just preparing you for something jaw dropping.
Its 2015, if you're a fan of shonen and theres some way you haven't seen this yet, just drop what you're doing and go watch episode 1 right now. (Then watch the next 147)
I hope you enjoyed this review, 
and obviously I recommend H x H 120%!",9

                Updated: 26th, march, 2016
Fixed grammar errors, and shortened some details.
First of all, I have watched/finished this anime pretty long time ago but this is my first time reviewing it completely. [Have started watching again]
Story: Arcs are all good and solid, though I felt that the first arc: Hunter Exam Arc was one of the most interesting and exciting. Few episode side stories are good and the best part is that they give depth to some characters like Killua for example. Story proceeds logically, is continuous and pacing is really good. This is one of the few anime I would recommend for beginners because deep inside
                  the ""typical"" and shounen adventure anime there are some real aphorisms, like what is true friendship? What keeps you motivated to sth? Ofc it has the most typical confrontation that is basic in anime is right vs wrong. Hunter x Hunter 2011 is very easy to approach because it doesn't have confusing flashbacks, loose stories and it also has understandable entirety. Story core is simple, but the way they proceed feels natural and pleasing. I had little bit mixed feelings at first in Chimera Ant Arc and last arc, but they ended extremely well. Story is unique and not predictable. Now some things about individual elements in the story: action is thrilling (heart just beats and accelerates). Adventure is intriguing and motivating. I was going to give 9/10 because 148 episodes is a lot, but I decided not to because they just simply did/performed very well in overall. 
10/10
Art: Is unique, fresh, memorable and the character design is at a first glance a little bit ""childish"", but you get used to it pretty fast and start to like it. There are some decent details in cities/houses outside [Little bit of texture], but not considerably. Animation overall is good and throughout the episodes solid, they also describe action scenes pretty well for example speed/velocity lines when someone is punched. Action scenes are the point where they have succeeded the most in my opinion. Most of the characters can easily be recognized who is ""bad/evil"" and who is ""good"", not much of exceptions there. I didn't really enjoy scenery because they weren't crisp/detailed enough.
9/10
Sound: Well this is one area I have to tell the truth I was a little bit disappointed when I found out that OP:s are all the same, just animation changing. Yes, it is very good, cheerful and compelling, but I was expecting more cool OP:s like in FMA: Brotherhood. Themes/Osts on the other hand were excellent. I get chills when something tense is happened and ost is playing on the background. [The puppeteer and Riot are one of those]. My favorite theme is the Legend of the martial artist. ED:s are excellent besides ED1 isn't really to my liking... I am strict because of the reason that they didn't even have a 2nd OP and that's why I won't give a ""great"" score.
8/10
Character: This is the best part of all in this anime. You get background info so it gives nicely depth to characters and their motivation/reason of doing things. Characters are ""so-so"" balanced because of the genre/type it represents, there are not usually ""very"" realistic characters with flaws. MC is unusually stupid and here I remember likable or not Luffy from One Piece and Naruto. It's good that they won't show ""that"" much his stupidity, but I don't understand this thing. Character growth/progression is something where Hunter x Hunter shines, [well except for Gon...]. Killua actually ""changes"" in the series and acts/thinks differently which is extremely good! Gon on the other hand ... stays as a Gon, but he also shows a small progression/becoming a little bit more mature. Leorio and Kurapika have also character progression, in my opinion more than Gon even though they have less screen time... Like I mentioned earlier, Killua is the one who rocks in character growth! Villains motivations weren't deep and they were pretty confusing or too obvious. So we can say Hisoka was the best villain from the rest because his motivations were at least partly concealed which is better than being overly obvious or confusing.
10/10
Enjoyment: Yet another one I watched/currently watching with my sister who is not an anime fan [Has watched FMA in childhood and we watched later on FMA: Brotherhood]. Very easy anime to approach because no fan service at all! Yes, I would probably watch this for the 3rd time and it would still feel almost as good as it was at first. Of course you know what happens next, but the main thing is how they perform it. My heart was literally beating at one scene in Hunter Exam Arc and the ost just made it beating more! 
This anime is very memorable because it is close to my heart. I've found some nice quotes and I like to listen to ED Reason by Yuzu over and over again. 
10/10
""You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want. - Ging Freecs Hunter x Hunter (2011)"" 
Overall: Solid and well-built story with nice side stories. Depth in characters although not much in villains. Character progression a lot when compared to other anime. Exciting and intriguing anime which deals with humane questions/psychological factors like: Why am I, what I am? [Pretty bad one for example..]. Also includes conventional friendship -factor.
Good ED:s and various osts, but only one OP.
Unique and memorable art which is a little bit playful. 
Scenery aren't breathtaking or enjoyable to my mind. Last but not least, easy to approach.
10/10",10

                 - “You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that’s where you’ll find the things more important than what you want”
This message falls apart when you consider that the ""little detour"" also known as the Chimera Ant Arc took up half the series and was generally miserable for everyone involved.
Togashi has a way of hammering in one theme, then pretending that the real theme was something else, without actually earning it.
----
Plot: None.
This series is a training arc disguised as an actual story. I wish that was an exaggeration. So many episodes are dedicated to the convolutions of Nen, the stories power system,
                  which for some godawful reason cannot be explained in less than five paragraphs. Especially when the whole system is ignored to give characters whatever random power the author wants. Again, not exaggerating.
Outside that, so many side plots just drop off halfway through the story and are never addressed again. The world-building feels like it was made up on the spot. The Chimera Ant arc, apparently the greatest arc of all time to some people, is so far removed from the rest of the story that I think I could cut it entirely and then publish it as a standalone series and only improve everything.
Art: Good. I don't put much store in art.
Characters: This series has great characters. To be more precise, those characters are Killua and Meruem. *Maybe* Hisoka. Outside those three, you might as well be watching interchangable cardboard cutouts. Nobody stays in the plot long enough to actually feel like they matter. Characters die left and right, so it's hard to get interested in the latest in a long line of wacky personalities, no matter what they do. It's even harder when you realise that nobody save the main duo actually stays around for two consecutive arcs.
Enjoyment: This series did not live up to my expectations, and I didn't have very high expectations in the first place.",3

                Contains minor spoilers	
            In the eternal quest for success, fame and recognition, it could be argued that for every step forward in the shounen genre anime creators have taken two steps back. Or two steps to the side. Or even moving in a circle. The unfortunate state of a once great genre is now reduced to a confusing muddle of cliche tropes that makes fans resign themselves to admitting that the best days of shounens are behind us. But even now there remain gleams of hope, of a light in the darkness. There are
                  occasionally anime that come once in a decade and promise the dawn of a new era in the shounen world. They are born of sheer genius and talent, glowing monuments that tell us in no uncertain terms that the best days of anime are not behind us. The series Hunter x Hunter is such a masterpiece. Revisiting old tropes and remodeling them into something new entirely, subtly exploring past and contemporary issues, and gently teaching the audience profound moral lessons. HxH does all of this while captivating viewers inside what honestly seems like a dream, a dream that one awakes from breathless and with a pounding heart when the final episode is over. 
          To those new to anime a brief explanation may be required. The world of anime is rich and vibrant with dozens of different genres that it is subdivided into. One such is the shounen genre. Shounens (literal translation is “few years” in English) are aimed at an audience of young boys. There are many good shounens and many bad shounens, but you can describe most of them with “worn out.” The basic principle of the shounen is having an underdog protagonist (usually a young boy) who either has some emotional realization that somehow grants him superpowers, or spends several episodes training to unlock those superpowers. Famous examples of shounens are Naruto One Piece and Bleach (these were once called the Big Three of shounens).  Especially to those new to anime, this can be a fun cycle to watch at first, but after the 5th or 6th time watching anime that are essentially carbon copies of each other, one wants something….more. A very great principle in the life of an anime veteran is finding that elusive “breath of fresh air” show that takes the essential principles of the genre and turns them on their head. I can personally assure you that you will find no boring and overused cliches in HxH. It definitely has the beginnings, a young MC, training arcs, battles against villains. But the MC is….not what you’d expect from a 12 year old boy, the training arcs are a new and imaginative take on what is typically an unbearable cliche, and the battle scenes are so incredibly epic and stunningly envisioned that sometimes forgetting to breathe is a serious problem for the viewer (I recommend using a heart monitor and respirator as needed). 
            Now that I’ve cleared up some of the technical details, it's time to get down to the show itself. The original HxH came out in 1999 and is considered a fantastic show, a true work of art. When the series was remade/rebooted in 2011 the world promptly forgot the original existed. Yes, it was and is that influential. From now on whenever I use the title I am referring to the reboot series as that is what this review is about. MAL (the most widely used and in my opinion reputable of the anime ranking sights) has HxH ranked as the #7 best anime (out of 13,000+) in the world, with 1.2 million votes. It has a 9.06/10, which is a sign that the fanbase almost universally loves it. HxH has 148 episodes that average about 20 minutes apiece. Especially to a newcomer this may sound like a big commitment to watch, but trust me it isn’t. After a certain point it becomes impossible not to binge, and even if by some miracle you don't binge the show will serve as a fantastic hobby to pursue over several months. 
	The main character of this show is named Gon Freecs, he is a 12 year old boy who sets out from home to follow in the footsteps of his missing father Ging. With his mother dead and his father missing for his whole life, Gon is raised by his aunt Mito on the desolate and isolated Whale Island. From an early age Gon is enamored of his fathers occupation. Known as Pro-Hunters, a tiny select group of elite individuals roam the world with varied intentions. Some choose to become Hunters for the wealth and influence it gains them, as a Hunter license is incredibly rare and allows its owner access to rights that an ordinary person does not have. Others are just in search of adventure or want to prove that they are the best by passing the legendary exclusive Hunter Exam. Gon’s reason for wanting to be a Hunter is simply that his father was one, and as a Hunter Gon might gain the opportunity to finally meet his long lost dad. 
         And so, Gon heads out on his journey to become a Hunter. There is more than one way to become a Hunter: taking the exam, stealing a license, paying for one, or killing the previous owner are all considered legitimate means of becoming a Hunter. This is where HxH begins to differ from the mold. It's a subtle but important point that illustrates that this show has a darker interior, that maybe what you see on the surface is not all that this anime truly is. The previously mentioned Hunter Exam is the only honorable way of joining the Hunters, and as Gon is a pure person at heart, this is what he sets out to do. The test itself is an incredibly rigorous tand designed to push its participants to the limit and judge whether they are worthy to join the elite ranks of the Hunters. Needless to say that Gon has many hardships along the way, what they are and if he obtains the license in the end is something that can only be learned by watching the show (or using Google). 
	Again, for the inexperienced, some additional explanation may be required. Anime, especially long anime often does not follow the same storyline for its entirety. It is subdivided into segments called arcs, each of which has its own storyline which may or may not be a linear continuation of what came before it. Think of it like a series of books: each book follows the same characters but they all have different plots. HxH arcs vary wildly in the type of content they contain, but they all flow smoothly into each other with a very gentle and natural transition between them. The first arc is the previously mentioned Hunter exam arc, there are seven total arcs and explaining all of them would not only provide minor/major spoilers but would take a very long time, as it would essentially be a summary of 148 eps of anime. Hence this review will only summarize the first, third arcs as these will provide enough proof for why HxH is such a breath of fresh air for shounen fans. 
          The third arc takes place several weeks after the Hunter Exam, when Gon and his new friend Killua (all characters will be explained later) head to Heavens Arena to test their skills against the world's foremost martial artists. The Heavens Arena is set in a building with 251 floors that new challengers have to fight up one at a time, with fights ranging from brawls on the low level floors to intense magical duels on the higher floors. The difficulty and prizes both increase the higher up in the arena the fight is held. This arc is arguably one of the slower ones despite it being mostly about tournament fighting, but it really says a lot about the character of the show and how it breaks through from the miasma of shounen cliches. First of all, the reason Gon and Killua are fighting isn't to save the world or any other grand reason. They originally want to earn some money as they are both broke, but while at the arena they are exposed to a form of “magical” power. It’s magic in the perception of a westerner, more a power exerted through manipulation of the body's innate aura, a power called Nen. This is another great example of how HxH differs from other shounen. A strong cliche is that the MC will obtain a superpower, however Nen is...different. For one thing it does not seem very powerful at first, and indeed Gon and Killua are not suddenly granted ultimate-tier power on the food chain. Quite the opposite, they learn that the world is a lot bigger than they had first imagined and that there are hundreds of people who are stronger and more experienced with Nen than they are. This might seem like a subtle point, but experiencing it the show really adds a whole new dimension to the power dynamic that is essential in any shounen. This arc is a classic example of how HxH can seem to be slow but do an about one-eighty into fast paced and mind blowing action. As soon as Gon runs into an old adversary on the 200th floor, the arc becomes something else entirely. It is impossible to go into detail without spoiling it, but the climax of the arc is very different from what you might expect in a typical shounen. 
          Do these arcs sound interesting? Trust me, relative to the others they’re nothing special. There are certain chapters in this grand story that can and will blow your mind. I chose to summarize the first and third because I believe they have shown just how different HxH is from the rest of the genre.
         If you have heard about this show you will probably have heard the characters raved about. They are indeed one of the greatest attractions, and without exception they are different from any other shounen cast I can name. I’ve already talked about Gon enough, so I will skip him in this section. Killua is another boy that Gon meets at the Hunter exam. Killua has a dark past that originally made me think he was going to be the stereotypical foil to the MC, and while their pasts are indeed opposites, they have a surprising amount in common in the personality department, becoming fast friends and the two of them are the major focus of the series. Gon meets two other boys at the exam, the calm and reserved Kurapika with mysterious reasons for becoming a Hunter, and Leorio, an often rude treasure hunter who turns out to have a good personality after they get to know him. These two feature prominently in several of Gon’s adventures, but for most of the series he and Killua travel alone. They meet many, many colorful and unique characters, but at its core, the story follows the two of them. This is yet another way in which HxH diverges from the norm, it refuses to follow the Rule of Three (1 lead with 2 sidekicks, or 3 leads) which typically binds adventures and action in media.
Doesn’t Gon sound like a cool lead? Come on, a twelve year old boy joining an elite group of wanderers to find his lost father? Well there are times in this show when Gon just vanishes. The story is told from the perspective of other characters, sometimes even villains! It’s not just a few episodes either, sometimes he takes a back seat for a long time. And sometimes….I forgot he existed? It's certainly possible to not be a Gon fan, but I am. And the fact that he could disappear and I didn’t give it a second thought is testament to how fluid the story telling is and how expertly it is told from the perspectives of other characters. I can honestly think of no other anime, shounen or not, that tells the story from a perspective other than one of the leads. And it works. Some of my favorite parts of the show are seeing things through a different perspective. 
            The “heroes” of this show are amazing. They bring completely unique personalities and traits to the show. Every one of them without exception enhances the anime, collectively they form a complex web of relationships that bind both them and the show together, a phenomenon that truly is the hallmark of a great show. And yet if you hear HxH talked about you probably hear them mentioned for only a few words if at all. This is because they are eclipsed by the show's “villains.” If the heroes break the shounen character molds, the villains shatter it with an industrial jackhammer.  As someone who loves a good villain it truly hurts me to see the stereotypical shounen antagonist brag about his unbeatable super powers for five episodes straight only to end up being beaten by the power of friendship. If you feel the same way, fear not as you will find none of that in HxH. I’m not even sure I can call some of the antagonists in this show villains. Often they are more badass than the protagonists, and it has nothing to do with super powers. Take Meruem for example, it has been said (and I agree) that he went through more character development than any other villain in anime history. Or any member of the Phantom Troupe, they had no “destroy the world because we can” motives, they were more of a close knit family group that committed evil acts because they felt like it. If that seems cliche, it isn't. I just did a poor job of explaining it. The award for my personal favorite villain in HxH, anime, and media in general though has to go to Hisoka. Hisoka remains a mysterious figure throughout the series, he is originally introduced in the Hunter Exam but will have many run-ins with Gon and Killua throughout the series. Hisoka is addicted to fighting strong opponents, and like an angler when he sees the potential Gon has to be strong one day, Hisoka passes up the chance of killing him in favor of a more pleasurable confrontation later down the line. This makes him truly scary, he doesn’t have some death ray capable of taking out planets, in fact his Nen ability is not intimidating at all, it is how he uses his ability that's frightening. Hisoka is truly smart. He overcomes battles with his wits and experience rather than some overpowered ability. If I was going to point to a single reason that for me makes HxH such a genre breaking show, it is this. 
Hunter x Hunter is at its core an epic. It is a massive adventure that encompasses plots ranging from Gon searching for his elusive father to fighting in an all out war. Not only does the anime manage to tie this all together, but it does so in a fresh new way that takes some building blocks from the shounen genre and then makes them into something else entirely. Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's impossible to miss, but HxH is truly a genre defining series that is a victory in the life of every shounen fan. This review has attempted to present the various ways in which HxH differs from a typical shounen anime and should attract those who are bored to death with the cliches inherent in the genre. But there is still the question “will HxH still appeal to those who have never seen an anime before?” The answer is a resounding hell yes. Whether you are new to anime or are a grizzled vet, this show has something for everyone. It is a masterpiece of anime that can spend 10 straight episodes on a chess-like game and then instantly turn into an emotional rollercoaster. I will close this review by saying that no book, movie, tv series, or anime except Hunter x Hunter has ever made me cry.",10

                so since cant be a ""troll"" time to go on a in depth analysis on why its ass even though i shouldnt have to.
Anyways, The only character to have development is Killua, thats wack, When it comes to story telling the main character has a goal and when the series ends is when the main character obtains his goal, gon found his dad so the series should have ended, theres no point in dragging it on, Now i already know what you are going to say ""Oh Well gon isnt the main character, theres multiple main characters"" yeah no, theres this thing called a side
                  story and thats when a side character gets the spotlight or when the side character is a main character because its their story not the main characters story, so literally if you just re write episode 148 then it would be a perfect ending that makes sense and then after that make side stories kind of like in naruto with itachis shinden and things like that, Hisoka was honestly the best character, He was the most interesting, he was like goku, he wanted to fight the most powerful people and yes it might be weird that he got turned on by power but thats just his character, So hes like goku in the sense that he wants to fight the strongest people but he is actually smart which i think is really cool, One of the best fights was that Dodgeball game which confuses me because that wasnt even really a fight, dont get me wrong it was still good and i liked it but thats still some what confusing, Chimera ant arc wasnt really that good excluding mereum, the only reason it was good was because of Mereum, now for my personal experience, Everyone was telling me ""this is the best anime, its flawless, no anime can top this"" so i go and watch it with very high expectations, so i watched it and i was disappointed, I told those people i was disappointed and that it was just average and they just said ""ur opinion is wrong, its a masterpiece wym, you obviously didnt see what we saw"" yeah well obviously, you guys somehow saw a masterpiece when i saw that it was just mid, what am i missing? ""a brain"" yep so the fan base completely ruined it for me, Even though i watched all 148 episodes i cant remember some of the arcs, If it was enjoyable to me then i wouldve remembered all the arcs but i couldnt even tell you what happened in York new city, you also might say ""then why did you watch all 148 episodes?"" well thats simple, when it comes to anime i live by a rule, If i start a anime then i will finish it no matter how bad i think it is, ive wanted to drop multiple anime but i dont because i live by that rule and just give it the chance it deserves and watch it all the way through, so in conclusion if i didnt know about the fan base i would give it a 8/10 but the fanbase just ruined it for me so 1/10.",1
"
                This is my favorite anime of all time. This is the definition of greatness. This is the best shounen anime and no one can convince me otherwise. This is what people will remember how great a medium of anime can be. 
This is the anime that makes me watch more anime back in the early 2000s. I remember watching the 99 version and I was amazed at how dark it can be, how cool the character was, how vibrant the world is, and how goated both the protagonist and antagonist in this series. Each character serves a purpose and the character development of each and
                  every one of the characters is amazing. Despite the nostalgia part, i do think the greatness of this series is reflected through a brilliant mastermind in creating a world full of adventure, excitement, and lots and lots of emotional moments that I can't mention one by one. Once we start the anime, you will immediately be involved and dig down deeper and feel a connection to all the characters; you can feel their emotion, you can feel like you have an adventure with them, and you will cry, smile, laugh, all in one sitting.
Even though it came with a very slow start, but it serves a purpose in building up the story and set relationships of each character, and the story just getting better and better. Hunter exam arc is a good arc to begin, despite the boring Zoldyck arc, but once you get past the first 3 (three) arc and when you enter the Yorkneww City Arc, this is WHERE GREATNESS BEGAN, and Chimera Ant Arc is the best shounen arcs ever made with so many emotions, so many tears, so many laughs, so many fights, so many cruel antagonists, and guaranteed to make you entertain despite the slow start.
The 2011 HxH is the peak of any shounen. Madhouse has successfully created one of the best manga adaptations this industry ever witness. Honestly, the manga design is not as great as you will expect it to be due to Togashi's inconsistent drawing even though it came with a very very great story, however, Madhouse upgrades it to a whole new level. The attention to detail, upgrade on the character design, and they do give justice and this is like the best tribute to Togashi as the original creator. The opening song is so memorable and it has become so emotional for every fan, all the endings and theme songs fit really well with the overall theme of the series. The 2011 version has successfully adapted 2 (two) of the best shounen arcs ever created and the animation is so crisp, clean, and very clean. The voice actor acting are out of this world and they deliver their best in portraying the characters and we can feel every emotional moment become so alive with the seiyuu great performance
What makes Hunter x Hunter is so great and memorable is not only the story and beautiful setting. It's about all the characters that are unique and has strong personality within each of them. Togashi is a brilliant mangaka that beautifully crafted all the power scheme, story, plot build-up, incredible world-building, various mystical land and creature, and the best character interaction and rivalry I've ever seen. Some of the fights are also cool to see, the complex antagonist really uplifts the series, the protagonist is not also as naive as it seems to be, and the plot build-up is as good if not better than series like One Piece.
Hunter x Hunter is not just an anime; its an experience to be remembered; it's one of the comfort anime to watch; it will make you appreciate how far human imagination can go; 
Its a must-watch for every anime fan. It's a timeless classic that will make you appreciate the industry of Japanese animation for creating such a brilliant work",10

Ok people, let's be honest. This is one of the best anime out there. Unfortunately, it is not as popular as other shounen series( like Bleach, Dragon ball, Naruto, One piece) but it is definetely the best or at least at the top 3 of the shounen anime. Let's go deeper:
Story: 9
The story sounds like a classic shounen anime, and it is But, the story is full of epic-sad-badass moments. The pacing is nice, no filler episodes (just 2 recap episodes),  and a satisfying ending for someone who has no idea of what happened to the manga.
Art: 10
Madhouse oh Madhouse. Once again,
                  this company proves that it makes the best animation out there(or at least one of the best animations). The art is amazing, both on landscapes and characters, and it fits the anime. No more to say here, just awesome.
Sound: 9
A huge amount of soundtrack which have almost everything, for every feeling and moment. Sad soundtracks, happy soundtracks, action soundtracks etc...Everything!!! The soundtracks fit the backround atmosphere everytime with perfection. The only ''bad'' (well, not actually bad) thing i found about the sound of this anime, is that many of the soundtracks can be listened in almost every episode, which makes me feel weird, cause the anime has many other stunning soundtracks to use in a specific scene. Weird usage, but maybe thats just me.
Character:10
Very interesting characters, and an excelent character development both on the main and the secondary characters. Many memorable characters, and every villain has a motivation for his/her actions, and the villains are not there just to exist. There is also a narrator.
Enjoyment:10
I do  believe that a non anime fan will enjoy this anime. You may get bored sometimes, especialy at the first part of the chimera ants arc, but still the story and the actions of every character remains awesome.
Overall:9
Are you a shounen fan? Just watch this anime. If you are not, give it a try, i am pretty sure you'll stuck with it till the end :)

Thank you for reading!",9

                Hunter x Hunter, the anime that deconstructed the shortcomings and honed the strengths of the battle shounen genre, and did things that were otherwise deemed impossible for a battle shonen. This is a review of why you should watch this masterpiece.
Story: 10/10
 Hunter x Hunter is about the adventures experienced by a young boy on his journey to find his father who had left him years before. But the story is not mainly focused on the journey to reach his goal but on the adventures faced by the protagonist and his friends on his journey as is said by a character - ""You should enjoy
                  the little detours to the fullest. Because that's where you'll find things more important than what you want."" The story of Hunter x Hunter is something anyone would find simple at first but evolves into something much more complex as it goes on. The story is told in an arc by arc format in which each arc contains different genres but the manner by which the genres changes when the arcs shift is flawless. The story could change from an all-out mafia war to a lighthearted isekai. The worldbuilding is exceptional with each place having its own set of rules. The story of HxH is mostly unpredictable and has great pacing except for some parts. The themes conveyed are highly impactful that although the main audience of the show are teenagers(as it's a shonen) they can change the perception of even a fully grown adult. It also contains an arc that I consider one of the most well-written arc in anime. There aren't any plot holes in the story that I discovered. There is also no kind of plot armor, power of friendship, or unnecessary deus ex machina - The characters have to face the consequences of their actions. The power system, which is the best I have seen in anime, is highly creative and balanced. The power scaling is well-balanced and focuses more on strategy and intelligence over ""who is stronger"". The ending is great ​and a satisfying conclusion to the story.
Animation and Art: 9/10
The studio, Madhouse has done an excellent job in adapting this anime like many others it has made. ​The art and animation are excellent compared to most anime released at its time and can also stand up to those of this time. The anime did a good job in adapting the art of the manga which is known for its inconsistent artwork.  Some of the fights also have impressive visuals.
Sound: 10/10
​Hunter x Hunter has some of the best OSTs I have heard like Requiem arenea, Legend of the martial artist, Restriction and Pledge, Hegemony of the food chain, only to name a few.  The OSTs are amazing and make the best moments a lot better. The opening, although is the same song for the whole show, creates a good vibe for every arc. The Ending themes are some of the best I have heard in anime and the songs match the vibe of every arc. The second and fifth ending themes were especially good and are my personal favorite. The Japanese voice actors have also done a very good job in expressing the character's feelings. The voice acting in some of the best moments was outstanding.
Characters: 10/10
​Hunter x Hunter has some of the most well-written characters I have seen in anime to date. All the main characters have their unique characteristics, depth, motivations, and goals which have been done impressively. The protagonist may seem like a generic shounen protagonist in the beginning but is shown to be much more complex later on.  Hunter x Hunter also has the best antagonists I have seen in anime. They are not evil for the sake of being evil but rather have their own ideals and motivations except for one antagonist that I felt poorly written but is out shadowed by the other well-written ones. Each arc has its own primary antagonists - there is no main antagonist. The character development in some characters is phenomenal and is done in a very believable manner and not sudden. One of its antagonists has the best character development I have seen in anime.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Hunter x Hunter was extremely enjoyable to me and I haven't felt any part as boring. But some parts are mainly focused on world-building(which only account for nearly 15% of the show) that some may find unenjoyable because of pacing issues. But it wouldn't be a problem if they were able to bear the pacing issues of anime like Bleach and Naruto. It was also very memorable and had a deep impact on me. 
Hunter x Hunter is an anime that I would recommend watching only after completing a few battle shonen as only then would you be able to understand what makes it stand out compared to most battle shonen out there, otherwise it would escalate your standards for a battle shonen.
Overall: 10/10",10

                Here is my attempt of a review.
Hunter X Hunter 2011 is an shounen adventure featuring Gon Freecss who decides that he needs to look for his long gone father Ging that has been gone a long time to become a hunter. Gon wants to find out why Ging abandoned him and his family to become a hunter and what is so special about this profession. Gon wants also to become a hunter.
Along the way he meets his 3 friends, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio. All of those characters have their own backstories and the reason to join up with Gon in order for them to become
                  hunters.
What is so special about this shounen compared to the rest?
Gon is a 12 year old boy who wants to become a hunter but in this show he does not overpower everyone after a while, yes, he gets his powers too via training but it is a brilliant ride to see him gain all those abillities, they are all very well explained in how they work and what they do. Gon is young and he does not know anything about this world but as he learns it so do we, for every event Gon gains knowledge around him but also responsibility. All the main cast is treated the same way, none of them feels like side characters but more of an family to Gon.
Story arc telling
While the main ""father"" plot is pretty mediocre, it is the arcs and those characters that brings Hunter x Hunter together. Eeach arc features a theme and develops the show further, some arcs deals with different main character and their desire why they want to be hunters in the first place.
The battles and animation
This shounen differs a lot from the crowd. Gon is 12 and the rest of the group is pretty young and therefore the battles are not resolved with brute force but rather with brains. There are pure battles of course but it never feels like the main group gets overpowered and destroys stuff. Since Hunter X Hunter is 148 episodes long you may think that the animation and production value would decrease over the time but thats not true. In fact, the battles feels like movie quality and the animation is almost Ufotable quality.
My personal favorite fight takes place almost at the end of the series where the music, animation and sound effects brings it to life. I dont want to tell you more since its a spoiler. When you finish HXH you will understand why the rest of the shounen genre is so far behind.
Final opinion
I have to mention that there are a bit of sluggish and dragged out episodes, betwen episode 100 to 120 feels like a drag and it could have been shorter. The beginning is not that strong either, the series starts out very light hearted but around episode 30 or so the series starts to grab you. Dont get me wrong, its not bad but not great either, its your typical shounen start.
I cant stand shounen becouse of all those years of crap shows like Naruto, Fairy Tail and many more. Those shounen series is what i dropped very quickly but HXH 2011 shows that the genre can change and the series is a proof of that, similar to what FMA: Brotherhood did back in the day. Those two are the staple of the genre for me.
Hunter X Hunter 2011 is amazing and you should watch it.",9

                -Ayumey Spoiler Free Review-
IF YOU THINK THAT THIS IS A KID SHOW OR IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS WHETER IF YOU SHOULD WATCH HUNTER X HUNTER READ BELOW, OTHERWISE READ ANYWAYS.
If you for some weird reason want the review in Swedish here it is:
http://imgur(dot)com/a/RrxDL
First, let me begin by saying that I was very surprised that I convinced myself to watch the first episode. It all started a year ago, when my fellow Swedish buddy told me about Hunter x Hunter and recommended me to watch it.
My response was something like this.-It doesn’t look good.
-It won’t fit me.
-I’ll put it into my plan to watch list (with a mindset that I’d never actually watch it).
It wasn’t until November 29th this year on a regular boring Tuesday that I realized that I was wrong all along. It’s at times like these that you realize how easily you misjudge things instead of looking and trying it out and to be honest I felt a bit embarrassed with myself. I can wholeheartedly say that Hunter x Hunter is one of the best shows that I’ve ever watched, whether if it’s an anime or whatever. So, what I’m trying to accomplish here is to open the eyes of those who thought just like I did and to give this anime a review that it truly deserves.
Story: I’ll go through this somewhat quick since most of you probably already knows this from the synopsis or perhaps reading someone else’s review. Anyways, after being abandoned by his father as a young boy, our main character Gon goes on an adventure to find him as well as becoming a Hunter to understand what made it more appealing for his father to become a hunter instead of raising and be there for his own son.
 However, Gon is not alone on this adventure as he meets a lot of new friends as well as enemies on his journey. The show builds up a lot on friendship and becoming stronger overtime. It’s not a show where the main character deals with every problem unhurt, it’s quite the opposite since Gon fails more than he succeeds. After being such a long anime I don’t think it damages the story at all and there aren’t really any filler episodes. I can agree with some people that the Chimera Ant arc is relatively slow from time to time, however I don’t think that there is too much to complain about as it’s more of a minor issue, the beginning looks very promising and you get some real kickass episodes toward the end.
Characters: Hunter x Hunter consists of a bunch of different characters and in my opinion they managed to create them almost perfectly, it’s one of the stronger sides to this anime. Although that the spotlight is on Gon and Killua, I feel that they really succeeded to create unique and promising characters with strong personalities. Holy !#?% they develop so well throughout the story.
Sound: I don’t have too much to say about the intro / outro, I feel like it fits the show well. The intro catch onto you quickly and before you know it you’ll stand in the shower humming to it. When it comes to the voice acting all I must say is that it was amazing and it fits the characters so well as they could capture their emotions remarkably well.
Art: Here comes the tough part to decide since the characters’ design was the big reason to why I was rejecting this show in the first place. But I’d say the more I was watching, the more I accepted it and then I started looking at the big picture instead. However, Gon for example could have easily looked so much cooler, instead he kind of resembles a garden gnome in my opinion. You’ll most likely get impressed by the art style sooner or later, just like I did, there were a lot of amazing episodes. *cough* episode 131 *cough*
Negatives: The beginning of Hunter x Hunter felt a bit slow (still good), it could have been a lot better and way more engaging to capture the viewer from the start. Chimera Ant arc was slow from time to time, but it was way far from being bad, could have been better though, but hey nothing is perfect.
Conclusion: One of the best shows I’ve ever watched. Although I was quick to judge I don’t regret a second that I chose to watch this amazing anime. Incredibly unique, well planned with a fantastic story. Well-made none generic characters, with good voice acting and great character development. Plus plus and plus from my side. Thank you, Madhouse, for this wonderful anime called Hunter x Hunter.
TLDR: For those of you who immediately jumped down here, don’t take this personally but you are a lazy person and with that being said here is the TLDR version.
-Don’t judge the show, if you feel unsure whether if you should watch Hunter x Hunter, just take a few episodes and make your own judgement. It’s not meant for everybody, but at least makes sure if it’s for you before you just leave it.
-Story: Amazing, marathon friendly (even though it’s 148 episodes long).
-Characters: Likeable, none-generic and well developed.
-Art: The big reason why I rejected this anime in the first place was because I thought that the main character Gon looked like Garden Gnome. Yes, I just said it. But believe me you’ll most likely be surprised if you start watching this.
-Sound: Fits well, intro will get stuck in your head and the voice acting fits the characters well.
That was it for my review, thank you for reading it!

                Oh no! Hunter x Hunter ended! It was inevitable, however the manga continues. This is your typical shounen adventure serious with an interesting plot.
What is a hunter? Well simply, hunter is a strong and skilled individual that was good enough to pass the hunter exam and get their hunter license making them part of 
the hunter association. 
What do hunters do? They do whatever they want! They have very little restrictions and are given tons of credibility. There are different types of hunters:
Blacklist Hunters - Go out catching criminals
Contract Hunters - Hunters hired by businesses to do jobs 
Gourmet Hunters - Hunters that go out
                  looking for new and dangerous ingredients
These are just some of the MANY jobs a hunter can do.
The story is about a innocent, happy 13 year old boy who was abandoned by his father as a baby to be a hunter. Unlike most little kids that would cry about it ""OH MY FATHER LEFT MEEE"" this kid had a different approach ""Being a hunter must be an AMAZING thing if he left his own child for it"" and he was right, his adventure began with the hunter exam, making friends and having more adventures. His goal for being a hunter? To find his father. Although he has such a simple linear goal, he finds himself stuck in multiple situations where his life is on the line and has to become stronger to survive.
The drawing is nice, kind of cute-ish. The attack effects are nice looking, nothing too significant.
The opening music doesn't change, thats what sucks. The sound is the same but you hear slight word differences but really its the same song through the whole anime.
The characters are varied, we got all types, the idiots, the always happy, the dark, etc.
BIGGEST PROBLEM, way too much narration, the characters don't explain shit, the narrator does, it kinda kicks me out of the mood. I would feel like I'm part of the adventure and then the narrator starts explanations and its really annoying, i mean some of the stuff is obvious but still gotta be explained.
Very enjoyable anime to watch, the more it goes the better it gets, the beginning of the anime is nothing compared to the rest. My favorite was Greed Island ;)
Overall - 9/10",9

                Hunter X Hunter is essentially a Shonen battle series that takes all the common tropes within the genre and flushes them down the toilet.  It's so well crafted, and easily a cut above just about any other Shonen series I can think of. If Togashi claimed the majority of his hiatuses were to gather material and think things over, I would believe him. 
Story: 9- The story of Hunter X Hunter follows Gon Freecss, a young boy who's long dreamed of becoming a ""Hunter"" so he could explore the world and find his dad, Ging. 
Now, don't be fooled. Hunter X Hunter is NOT
                  a series about hunting... or at least not in the kind of hunting you're thinking of. Hunters are part of an organization of elite humans who typically use their skills to discover, and help the world. For example, some Hunters specialize in assassination, while others may work to uncover ruins. Hunters are granted permission to go nearly anywhere they choose, and do whatever they want. 
I don't want to say too much about the story, because I think the less you know, the better, as with pretty much any series. Only other thing I'll add is, like I said, this is a Shonen battle series without the Shonen battle traits. Battles are almost always tactical, each character is incredibly unique as far as abilities go, characters can be killed off just like that... It actually tends to be quite dark at times. 
One other thing, is that the manga of this series has been on hiatus for quite awhile (over one year) and because of that, the series has also stopped. Don't let that deter you from watching it, though, as the anime does give you enough closure for now to feel satisfied, until Togashi starts working on the series again.
Art: 9-  Madhouse captures Togashi's art style for the series perfectly in this adaptation. I'd even argue that they do a better job in fact. (Togashi got really lazy with his art sometimes)
Character: 9- While it may share some common elements of Shonen, Hunter X Hunter is really in a league of its own, creatively. 
Enjoyment: 9- From beginning to end, I had a blast with this series. A lot of people seem to think it gets slow at times, and some episodes border on an entire 20 minutes for narration, but let me tell you that when it gets going, you'd be hard pressed to be as an enthralled as Hunter x Hunter will make you.
Overall: 9- As mentioned, Hunter x Hunter is really its own breed when it comes to Shonen series. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting plot, great characters, and something that's generally much different than anything you've experienced. If you're looking for a dumb over the top action series, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. 
Why are you still reading? Load up Crunchyroll and get watching!",9

                Hunter x Hunter is about a determined, optimistic, oblivious Gon as he comes out of his sheltered island and learns what life is. Along the way, he learns about Hunters.
Okay, before I review it as a whole, let me just say. I LOVE the character development. It's outstanding, realistic, and it doesn't surprise you. It isn't sudden. It takes your breath away, yes, but it isn't a headscratcher.
I also love the variety of the characters. I must say, if there were a few more female leads, that would've been great, but the two main ones we have are great.
This is a bit irrelevant, but there
                  is a canonically trans girl in this. Take that as you will, but she's adorable.
The reason why I gave the story an EIGHT was because at some parts, it was slow. I suppose it added onto the development, but I don't think we needed so much screentime about Nen, or for some arcs to be drawn out. In contrast to this, things I wanted to see more were cut off, leaving me a bit upset. Plus, it's a whopping 140~ episodes long.
Hunter x Hunter has an original plot, an original twist on shounen anime, and makes you actually snort when Gon does something stupid, or when he and his best friend bicker. Nothing seems very forced about the character development. I love all the villains, except for the one from the Greed Island Arc.
Good development, good art that fluctuates depending on the mood of the scene, fantastic everything. Yes, there are downsides, but go watch it. Now.",9

                Hello, fellow animesters!
 What I would like to say at the very beginning is this. At first I thought this shonen is for kids, because of its childish appearance but in reality it is NOT. If you wanted to watch it and decided not to do so, then go and watch it! What? you still here? Ok.
 I did like this anime very much. It shows how friendship is important in life and you cannot do much without friends. If you feel very lonely and even have no friends, because of some reasons like I do this anime is for you. 
 It is very
                  mature and quite deep. I personally did not like the ending but that is for you to decide whether it is good or not. 
Take care, everyone.",10

                (SPOLIER)
(SPOLIER)
(SPOILER)
Before I begin, this review is more of an opinion piece for myself; a way to achieve catharsis by reasoning out my experience and trying to move on. It may not make sense to others and I don't think it would give much insight until after you've watched HxH 2011. If you choose to read be warned it also contains major spoilers. 
Overall I would give hxh 2011, a 6-7. My suggestion is if you plan on watching it, don't binge watch it. You can finish this show in a week if you have the time, even less if you have the effort. But I
                  really suggest you don't, because I made that mistake and it's what drove me to a lower score than I think it honestly deserves. 
The first half of this show is amazing, it would cement itself easily in best shonen animes/manga based off of the first 70 some episodes. That is why I gave the original hxh a 9/10. However, in my opinion, it's all down hill from there in regards to pacing, rhythm and character development. 
Everything after the events of Greed Island, namely the Chimera Ant Arc, is where it went down hill. Up until this point, the pacing was typical shonen with building friendship and trust, big battles, short training periods, and battles testing strength and resolve again. Even with all this, most arcs didn't take more than 20-25 episodes.
The entire last half of hunter x hunter is dedicated to only one arc, spanning more than 60 episodes. It's a complete pace change, where we went from light hearted hope and admiration of Gon and Killua's strength to complete terror and darkness. No seriously, I'm surprised the rating didn't go up considering the torture scenes, massacres, lack of morality, death and the amount of dismembered limbs. 
The characterization goes completely wonky where half way into the arc Gon and Killua do a complete character swap - Gon with murderous intent motivated by revenge and Killua the loyal friend with a driven will to protect those around him. Mentally it left me a bit put out when I realized I was more excited to see Killua on screen than Gon, considering a large part of his part in the battle is sitting in one spot, crying, and then going bat shit insane. The power-ups were insane but ultimately useless. Gon and Killua's characterization remain questionable right up until the very end. I can't say with certainty I disliked their new qualities but I just felt that the reasons for the shift were too quick and too unfounded to really have any impact on me. I was left more confused as I jumped episode to episode on where this was going than excited to see how this would end. 
The battles are disappointing and the defeat of the Chimera Ant is almost largely accidental.  Netero defeats the King not with Nen but with a bomb and the King's own pride, after which we see the King being reborn even *stronger* than before. It's at the point where I threw my hands in the air and was just done with the absolute imbalance of power. It was at the point where I was so certain the only way they could go with this was the complete devastation of humanity because not even a Goku level power up could save any of them. But then lo and behold, the Ants are defeated not by strength, but by a delayed poison effect, leaving them to die on their own with no opponent needed to face them (not that anyone there stood a chance). What's worse is before that point, there is a complete character change in the 'villains', to the point where you almost sympathize with them. That was neither good nor bad but just a quiet end to a bombastic season. 
 I think the biggest reason the Chimera Ant Arc was so disconcerting is because it was fruitless. We spend 60 some episodes on the massacre of humans, the fight for humanity, the ultimate war,  and at the end of it I do not honestly feel like the Hunters 'won', just that they got lucky that the events unfolded the way they did. Knuckle and Killua hardly do anything real fighting the entire 'war', Netero and Morel too much.  Gon going berserk in his battle with Pitou led to more harm than good - and that he had to go to that point to win also made the months of training and will beforehand seem pointless. Netero's fight was fascinating, but it wasn't a good enough to tip my opinion - his ultimate attack did mediocre damage, leaving him to have to resort to death by bomb to kill the King.  The character deaths in this arc give me a strong reminder to the pacing of AoT/SnK and it was really off putting compared to the first half.  
The snowball effect continued on with the last 10 or so episodes with the Chairman Election Arc. Most of the time spent on this arc was trying to figure out the dubious logic that was fuelling the election. I have a university degree that specializes on critical analysis, and even with it I was left shaking my head in confusion on how any of the events made sense or were even pertinent to the growth of HxH. 
The final straw that crumbled my enjoyment for HxH were completely summed up in the last episode in 3 main parts: how Gon finally met Ging - an abrupt end to the journey I felt like Gon has yet to complete; how Gon and Killua chose separate paths - the deep bonds of their friendship leaving me to wonder why they would do so when the narrator even admitted that Killua considered him his most important person; and how we never see Kurapika again - the most interesting plot line from HxH that was left too short and uncovered, and which I thought we would revisit one last time before the end. The culmination of all of that was having all the 148 episodes I binge watched become empty and hollow - like  the stairs I was climbing to reach the peak suddenly started to crumble the closer I got only to completely break leaving me to free fall.  It's an empty feeling I feel like a lot anime lovers can empathize with when the end is not what we expected. 
So overall I cannot say that this was a bad anime - just a confused one.  If there is another season or renewal in the works a year or years from now, I would like to watch it. No, I need to watch it. Because as it is right now I am left with a niggling feeling of disappointment and empty promises where there is brilliant potential for more.",7

                Before I watched Hunter x Hunter I've seen that reviewers here are divided
into two major sides. One is the people that praise Hunter x Hunter, saying it's the best shounen ever and the second is people that say it's overrated and very typical. I used to agree that it's overrated, but as I started watching I realized how wrong I was and my opinion drastically changed.
First I wanna say that I don't think Hunter x Hunter is the greatest anime of all time. ""Then why you gave it 10/10?"" you may ask. 
Well there are two major aspects that I value the most in anime
                  : characters and overall enjoyment, and Hunter x Hunter managed to nail them perfectly.
Story : 9/10
Hunter x Hunter storyline definitely isn't the greatest and most complex, but it also isn't simple nor dull. The world of HxH and the way it works is very solid and makes sense.  This anime well manages to slowly teach us principles of it's world to then descend more into complexity of it.
The plot itself is very enjoyable and the story progression throughout the series is carried out very well and it's balanced between typical, brighter scenes and very dark, unsettling themes and series of uncommon, original developments. 
Art : 10/10
Artwork in Hunter x Hunter is straight up brilliant. Animation is fluid and pleasing to watch from start to finish. Characters designs are very diverse and nice.
Sound : 9/10
Music is great and it really does it job well to express climate and important of each scene. There're few tracks that are various versions of same track or instrumental version with slight changes, but it's completely fine, it's even better to hear different variations. Overall, Hunter x Hunter OST is just beautiful.
Characters : 10/10
Here it is, one of the best things in Hunter x Hunter - characters. They're well-written and more complex than you might think. You can get attached to them and sympathize with. Gon and Killua are great protagonists, they both develop emotionally and physically and sometimes they do it in uncommon and unexpected directions. Antagonists are very interesting, amusing and some of them have very complex personality. Supporting characters also get their chances to shine and have fair impact on the story. 
Enjoyment : 10/10
Hunter x Hunter gave me great joy and many different feelings that other animes can't simply trigger so easily without cast of characters such as this. 
Overall : 10/10
Maybe fair score would be around 9-9.5/10, but I just love this anime and if you're looking for a great adventure with lovable and memorable characters then just give it a shot, it's absolutely worth it.",10

                so many amazing things in it, it's hard to describe! But I will say to begin with, don't judge it on how it looks to begin with!
The anime overall is incredible! The art style is fun and attractive, but also does very well portraying dark scenes and gloomy settings. It really made me want to imagine the larger parts of what you don't get to see from the characters perspective! :D
The music and sound are great! I loved the Japanese voice actors, I can't say anything for the English version as there is none, but I'd highly recommend the Japanese version even if there was
                  one. The songs have loads of feeling in them, and really bring in the extra step in making the visuals more enhanced! 
The characters have great depth, and are really made lovable and relatable  throughout the story. Thy develop in a semi-realistic manner, and really get your emotions moving alongside them. Each character makes an impact, no matter how small a part they play, and they seem to bring a different view to things making them more interesting to encounter.
One thing which I absolutely LOVE with this anime, is that there are no filler episodes! This means that you don't have to skip pointless episodes that have nothing to do with anything, but they are all incredibly interesting and really help you flow from episode to episode. Although there isn't any filler, there is technically one episode which recaps all the past ones, but that's only around episode 12, and only happens once.
Overall, I honestly can't find much fault in this anime at all, at least not without analyzing it from all points as if I were to look for things I can scrutinize. I don't watch animes to see whats bad with them, I watch them to enjoy them, so any minor flaws that I might have missed can probably be found in someone else's review :P",10

                “You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that’s where you’ll find the things more important than what you want”.  - Ging
I don't have anything else to say other than this is a masterpiece. As such, I'm highly recommending it. I personally liked the fast-paced manner on how they remade the Hunter Exam and the York New City Arc. 
The Chimera arc  was brilliant. Story wise, Hunter X Hunter is one of those on top of its league. Brilliant. 
The art has improved, adding more vibrant palette compared to the 1999 version. It's also quite notable how the Gon and Killua
                  of this version look younger compared to how they started on the original version.  Nevertheless, the slight change didn't affect the story delivery as a whole so I think it's fine.",10
"
                I've read most of the reviews for this series, and there are a couple of things I must say that I really don't understand:
1. If you don't like shounens, why do you bother watching them just to write your obviously under-rating (because you don't like shonens) review? People (who DO like shonens) read these reviews to find out if THEY will like the series.
2. How can you give a review having only watched a couple of chapters? Do you know how the series will develop and/or end? The beginning of a capable series says nothing.
And now down to business. Hunter x Hunter is without any
                  doubt one of the best (if not the best) shonen series you'll get to see. Although the first couple of chapters are rather average, the story will evolve so It'll keep you on the edge of your seat most of the time. With it's near to none filling chapters or flashbacks, and the inexistence of annoying fanservice, it'll keep you hooked on almost all along the series (when I rewatched it, it took me less than 3 days).  
-Story (9/10):
I'm not going to enter in details, since it's already more than detailed in other reviews. 
It's rather simple, but deepens in in many aspects such as side characters. Sometimes the narrator will even explain some characters' backgrounds for no reason at all, which can turn into a pro or a con depending on the liking's of the watcher.  Although the several arcs are more than interesting, the links between them are quite faint. 
Overall the pace of the story was rather satisfying (except the Chimera Arc). You won't get the endless ''battles'' you have in Naruto or the staring you have in DB. 
The end was not quite a HxH-worthy one. You could clearly see something was missing, as if they had run out of ideas. Also, the main objective, which at first looked near to impossible to achieve, was just cleared like 'ok, found ya'. I wouldn't call it disappointing, but it could've been better.
-Art (9/10):
In comparison to the manga, the anime's art is surprisingly well done. All the reactions, movements (who said 'Hisoka'?) and battling are well put into screen. Hats off to you, Madhouse. 
-Sound (8/10):
I'm not a big fan of ed's and op's -I always skip them- so I can't say much about them. However, the OST's were convincing and fitted good in every scene.
-Characters (9/10):
You can't really wish for better main characters/villains. In all the anime I've seen, near to none have a as good starring as HxH. Deep backgrounds and psychological changes. Cruel deaths leaving deep scars. Almost no emotional power-ups or 'The Power of Friendship' crap. 
What I did find a bit disappointing was that good characters such as Leorio and Kurapika were forgotten after a while and turned into secondary characters. What happened to Kurapika's conviction to avenge his clan? 
Sometimes the appearence of a narrator can be a turn down in series. However, in this particular one, the existence of a narrator is crucial. Because of the amount of details, sometimes it's rather difficult to guess what's actually going on without a proper explanation.
-Enjoyment (10/10):
This is the anime I have enjoyed most. With it's intriging storyline, fabulous characters and good anime quality, I forgot about everything around me and only wondered about what surprises would come next. I feel like I can watch it over and over again and never get bored. I recommend you watch it for the first time with your friends and/or family-- the more, the merrier!
-Overall (10/10): If after all the reviews you've read you still can't make up your mind, I certainly reccomend you to watch this. If you like the shonen genre, I can guarantee you're going to love it.
Hope reading this helped you. Thank you for your attention.",10

                One of the best written pieces of fiction I ever experienced 
Imagine with me this  just imagine : 
1- creating an entire fictional  language for the world of this anime alone not jus a random fictional language but actually a language that it's written with it's own alphabet and can be translated to any real language in the world !! Just for an anime 
2- imagine creating an entire fictional video game with its own mechanics and rules contains over 300 collectable /  playable cards each card is carefully detailed and classified according to categories , this isn't some anime video game
                  that it's  there just  for the characters to get isekaied to (Sao) this is an actual unique game that can be played in the real world  !!! Created to just one arc and it's amazing !!!! 
3- imagine creating an entire fictional board game with rules and pieces and actual moves and strategies !!! to develop just one character and with it you write one of the best love story/ character development ever told !!!! 
4- imagine creating the best power system ever created in fiction with souch complexity and dynamic and intricacies that can literally contain any other power system in other fictional stories in one system and makes even more sense 
.
Now imagine that all of what I mentioned earlier existed in one story !!!!  Not only that but it's filled with a cast of one of most complex/ three dimensional / nuanced characters ever in fantasy stories , characters that feel like real ppl with different complex motives and complex goals that just clash into one another creating scenarios where there are no evil and good it's all about actual ppl finding themselves in complex situations and they have to solved not through punching and powering up but by bringing actual complex real logical  decisions that (like every decision in real life ) brings both good and bad results 
this gives the feeling that you're following some ppl trying to achieve something in their lives running from their past / trauma that shaped what they are now and continue to discover more things about themselves and the world 
There's no  chosen ones no great evil no saving humanity ( it happens once but the complexity of the situation makes realise it's not about it) no great good it's just peaople 
.
On top of that everything is happening in such a complex nuanced  world that feels real just like ours due to the amazing amount of details that writer put in every place the main characters go to 
Every place have its own personality and the writer takes a step further to gives details that not only makes this place alive but feels like it might exist in real life 
.
HxH managed to achieve all disguising as a typical shonen / fantasy adventure story and it really done it's disguise well that alot of ppl may dismissed as a simple shonen story 
.
.
I can write an entire book detailing what makes HxH work but let's just leave it here , It's hard to achieve what HxH achieved in story telling and not in just shounen",10
"
                Please don't hate me over this review. And I do not speak english fluently so excuse my grammar and spelling mistakes! Thank you (:
In my opinion, this anime is nice but that's all. It feels incomplete, something is lack, something is missing. 
Story: 
6/10.
Once I started watching it the first thought I had was ""what the hell, are they trying to imitate One Piece?!"", then while watching their attempt to get back Killua from his own dark family I couldn't help myself from thinking about Shaman King. As the series went on more animes popped up in my mind as Naruto, Sword Art Online etc.
Well,
                  I will not say that this is the biggest issue that bothers me. Nope, actually it feels that almost each arc wasn't properly finished. What happened to the spider's leader? What was Hisoka's contribution to the story? I liked his character but nothing really happened with him.
And I did not like the chimera ant arc at all.
On top of all that, EXCUSE ME for thinking that Ging's excuse was extremely lame, and accordingly, the end of this anime really disappointed me...
Art: 
9/10 
Not much to say. The art is great. Lovely (:
Sound:
5/10
Hearing the same opening over and over again for 148 episodes made me hate this song... Why didn't they change it? 
Overall, the OST wasn't too varied but it wasn't bad either.
Character:
7/10
I must praise the mangake and thank him for the creation of two of the cutest and the most charming characters in animes I have ever encountered. 
Gon and Killua are adorable and have made me smile so many times. Their friendship is encouraging and enviable. Seriously!
But .... The other characters were lacking and they didn't contribute to either the main characters or to the story. 
Enjoyment:
6/10
quite enjoyable.
however, I rarely do it, but watching this anime I had to skip parts of the episodes. The storyline was too slow, and there are episodes with no developments. A little frustrating. 
Over all
7/10
As I said, this anime is nice. I do recommend watching it, but all the good reviews made me believe Hunter x Hunter would be a whole different level, which I think was not. So with this recommendation comes the advice: lower your expectations and you will enjoy it twice! (;
Pls Don't hate me !
Thanks",7

                HxH feels like a niche enough, big Shounen anime that didn't have a long enough run time before parts of the fan to turn on it. For one of your first animes, it's probably the least offensive popular Shounen anime out there. If comparing highs and lows with the other nostalgic animes, HxH honestly stands no chance, aside from their best arc near the end, but the issue is that HxH has far fewer episodes, therefore less mistakes to be made for them to receive the same amount of criticism because you can bet they'd have just as many filler and garbage arcs for profits
                  as other notable titles if they continued airing.
At it's core HxH is a Battle Shounen, the story is basically nonexistent, and you're just on for the ride of cool fight scenes. My absolute biggest issue with this genre is power scaling consistency. You have this rock, paper, scissors power system that is extremely confusing as you not only need to understand their matchups but their Nen outputs as well, and nothing is concrete so it feels like it's a power system where the author could bullshit enough ways to make fights make sense without making it seem completely impossible. People always praise this power system in HxH, have no idea what they're talking about, the last thing you ever want is to be questioning whether or not certain characters should survive, or win fights in this genre.  
The pacing is relatively slow in some arcs, and drags on for too long. A large majority of the arcs are pretty dull and disinteresting and feels almost filler like with convenient main story plot. That narrator is extremely out dated and breaks the flow of the show constantly.
Aside from everything that there is to criticize about HxH, characters is probably not one of them. Aside from Gon, and I can go on a tangent about that but I'll refrain myself.",6
"
                A very overrated anime for sure.
If you, like me, watched or want to watch the anime based on what the fans said, you will end up being very disappointed.
It is a difficult work to evaluate, the first arcs have a good rhythm, interesting characters with a medium development, a soundtrack that excites a lot in some moments, but the end of the arcs are so disappointing, all with magic solutions of ""Deus ex machina "".
Many episodes are dragged, especially in the last arcs, in some of them I even wondered if I was watching the correct anime! I had to skip many to stay interested
                  in the anime and even the episodes I skipped barely made a difference in the development of the plot.
Many good characters are misused, while extras are given an unnecessary focus. Almost the whole plot ends open, it is very frustrating to watch so many episodes and realize that nothing really interesting has happened.
However, it is a good work. Nothing spectacular, some may like it more or less, but in general it is difficult for someone to dislike at least the beginning of the anime. Just keep in mind that the plot decays a lot in some moments.",6
"
                i will not go into detail a lot because i agree with so many points other reviewers made before me, but the series is a lot of wasted potential as well as having a lot of incosistencies in both the storyline as well as the character ""development"" (it basically doesnt exist). 
theres a bunch of interesting characters that just do not get enough screentime when meanwhile a whole bunch of new characters that arent even remotely important for the plot, get explored on a lot before getting sidelined again. 
the story really has so many interesting ideas and characters that they dont expand on for
                  whatever reason and while i wouldnt necessarily say that the exam arc was the absolute best, it felt it went really downhill from then (the chimera ant arc is so annoying i have no idea why its so popular. the writing is straight up bad and the pace is so slow i wanted to skip parts which hadnt happened even in the mediocre greed island arc before - not to mention the whole chimera ant thing feels like it just derails the main plot). its certainly not ""bad"" but i would only call this a ""masterpiece"" if it was the first time i had ever watched a series in my life. overrated as hell, but not terrible. 6/10",6

                ‘There’s nothing new,’ George Lucas once said.
Indeed, indeed. Despite the discourse surrounding it, Hunter x Hunter (in all of its incarnations) is a deeply shallow series with barely anything new in it for those who have basic understanding of art, anime, manga and culture. 
I have experienced loads of different art during childhood, boyhood and adulthood. As one grows up, you (hopefully) become more aware of the world and how, with regards to art, the sausage is made. Fist of the North Star, Dragon Ball, Ranma and other series during the 80s were inspired by wuxia and wuxia-inspired works. Even Togashi himself was inspired by
                  that with regards to Yū Yū Hakusho. 
With all this in mind, what Togashi has done here with Hunter x Hunter is nothing short of a massive disappointment for people who have actually dared to have an interest in the world. For starters, the characters are for the most part bland and the ones that actually are interesting have usually been handled much better in other works for actual adults (yes, folks, Hunter x Hunter is a show for literal kids. Get over it, buster). There's just nothing new.
In fact, that ""there's nothing new"" works on multiple planes for this series.
Hunter x Hunter has been adapted multiple times before this series. There was the 1998 OVA, the 1999 adaptation and then several OVAs that followed up on the story from the adaptation from 1999. Those still suffered from having a bad premise to begin with (the manga is bad in and out of itself), but the adaptation from 1999 was at the very least interesting since that series actually had quite impressive animation for a TV anime. This adaptation is bland from beginning and the animation only picks up at episodes in the late 70s if I remember correctly. Other than that, the animation is very stale for huge parts and the series is overly bright for a vast majority of the time.
That ""there's nothing new"" can also be said of a key aspect of the series. Huge inspiration is taken from wuxia, but it is only ever used at a shallow level to the point that the show suffers for it. Loads of lore and ""systems"" doesn't necessarily make for an interesting series. There is supposed to be an incredibly breathtaking battle in the series between two incredibly strong fighters later in the series, but it only showcases that Fist of the North Star and Dragon Ball did it better way before this series even hit the pages of Weekly Shōnen Jump. As the saying goes: being newer doesn't always mean better. Abilities and worldbuilding deftly handled in those series are instead presented as ""mind-blowing"" in Hunter x Hunter and act as time-filler until the episodes inevitably ends. 
On the whole, my main takeaway from this series (and general ""anime/manga fandom"") is that there is a bubble of sorts. Too many people staunchly refuse to experience beyond what they know and consume the same crappy modern Weekly Shōnen Jump titles that are doing nothing interesting or even well to begin with. Every time you watch a series like this you are (1) robbing yourself of experiencing more challenging/intriguing works for adults and (2) effectively contributing to the complete and utter annihilation of works for adults. Good Lord, put down your copy of Weekly Shōnen Jump/Star Wars/Lord of the Rings/The Hunger Games/Modern-day Dragon Ball/Naruto/Boruto/Seven Deadly Sins/Demon Slayer/My Hero Academia/Gintama/Bleach/Negima/Solo leveling/Tower of God/One Piece/Mandalorian/DCEU/Marvel or any other of that crap and try out actual works for adults because utilizing those works for the kind of escapism that anime/manga fandom is suffering from is in no way, shape or form even remotely healthy. You don't have to kneel before your corporate overlords and accept their garbage/lick their boot.
To summarize: there's nothing new and your time is better spent elsewhere. In fact, stop using anime and manga for escapism and actually acknowledge that you are a human being living with other people. Be critical. Participate in demonstrations, organize politically, develop new skills (learning a new language perhaps?), fight bigotry and help POC (people of color), attend university, find friends or deepen your bonds with existing friends. Good Lord, do something else. Anime and manga is a form of medium for art and just like any other medium, there can be good, bad or mediocre works. Just like how certain movies/books/games/television shows etc. don't cut the mustard, some anime and manga works also do not cut the mustard. Unfortunately, Hunter x Hunter is one of those works.",3
"
                It is hard to review this anime since it is not complete - at least the manga is not. 
However, I will say I enjoyed this quite a bit. It felt a lot like Yu Yu Hakusho, but more lighthearted for the first half of the series. It was an adventure in every sense of the word, and a charming one at that. The second half of HxH feels almost like a completely different show, with a much more serious tone. The pacing was pretty bad sometimes, and I did skip some episodes that seemed pointless to watch. There was also a narrator, and I
                  think this was a mistake. The audience is smart enough to know what is going on; we don't need somebody to point out the obvious. I realize that there is a narrator in the manga for this portion of the story, but I think the director should have scrapped this idea and just let the words of the narrator be heard in the thoughts of the actual characters themselves. That being said, some of the episodes in the CA arc are extraordinary. It was really hit or miss in this arc. 
I would probably give this an 9.5/10 when considering all of the arcs put together. 
* Hisoka & Netero are incredibly well-written characters",10
"
                When people say HxH is the best Shounen they mean it. What makes the anime so unique is the story itself. Each Arc has a distinctive story line reflecting parts of life. If you haven't watched the anime yet, you're missing out a lot! Believe me those 148 episodes were worth the journey! I rate an anime based on story, animation, sound, character and enjoyment. 
Story - 10/10
As said before the story is what makes the anime unique. Unlike other shounen anime where either the character is too weak/ too strong or tries to win a battle using ""power of friendship"",HxH is based on something
                  which has a deep meaning. It's about a young boy named Gon trying to find is father who left him when he was a small kid. On watching the anime, it's much more than a boy trying to find his father. Different arcs portrays different things about life such as - survival, war, crime, politics etc. Each arc keeps you hyped up. Apart from episode 13 and 26 HxH has no fillers, which again helps the viewers to understand the anime better. At start you might get a feeling that ""this anime looks childish"" but as you move forward it does take a turn. The characters itself teaches us a lesson that winning or training too hard won't get you a thing or two. Of course Gon does go on an adventure, meets friends under goes training, becomes strong, defeats enemies, etc. but what is different is that it shows that sometimes winning isn't everything, it's not about will power it about your emotions. It also tells us that we yet to learn more about this cruel world. Yes, the battles in the anime is another thing which makes the anime a masterpiece. The battles are well fought and animated. (talking about strategically and not strength wise). Again the battles are based on experience rather than your strength. The concept of ""NEN"" is visualized perfectly. Nen is just a source of power ( e.g., stand in jojo, chakra in naruto) which is based on the character and how he manages to use it. Yoshihiro Togashi did a great job writing a beautiful story. 
Animation 10/10 
I'd like to thank MADHOUSE to re-adapt this series. MADHOUSE is one of my fav. studios who animated some of the great shows like- Death Note, Monster, Perfect Blue, One punch Man Death Parade etc. The HxH 1999 lacked animation issues and didn't explain the story well. Thank god there was a re-adaption of this series or we would have missed a hidden gem. The anime as well as the characters are well adapted and the art is perfect. As I mentioned before the animation of the battles are magnificent. The amount of money MADHOUSE spent animating this series was totally worth it.
# Sound/Music 10/10
Most people blame that there was only 1 opening (Departure) used in the entire series. My reaction to that was - ""BRUH"". Of course there are 2 versions of the opening that was used accordingly in different arcs. I personally feel that the Opening was really good and I was happy to listen to it till the end. The OST in the anime was splendid which gave this ""alive"" feeling to the viewers watching this show. Voice acting was done exquisitely especially for Gon and Killua. I don't know why people have problem with the voice acting of the Narrator, I heard many people say it's ""Irritating"". Again, Bruh Why? It was perfect.
Character 10/10
Again, I would like to Thank Yoshihiro Togashi was creating such unique character based on standout personality. The four main characters are - Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio. Each character teaches you different morals and beliefs. 
1) Gon - One of the most positive characters that teaches us never to give up. He never showed any kind of hatred to people and forgave everyone due to his kind nature. 
2) Killua - Killua has a depressive childhood coming from the family of assassins. He's clearly the type of person who always stand for his friends and helps them in the darkest of times. He clearly shows that he wants to be his own person, and make his own decisions. It shows that he's willing to pursue his own journey and make friends, no matter how dangerous or intimidating his family may be.
3) Kurapika - Kurapika is another character who has a disturbing past. Knowing his clan got killed for their eyes, he stills values his friends and is not very eager  to run behind revenge. Tho, later on he's shown a bit depressed, his friends never leave his side. 
4) Leorio - He's a goofy character who seem really funny. he also has a way of showing his care and love for everyone around him, and cares about helping those in need. Like Gon and Killua, he would put friends first among all else, (which can be seen in many arcs especially Election Arc) even if it meant not having his own dreams become reality.
Enjoyment 10/10 
Personally I'm not that interested in Shounen, but HxH has to be my fav. shounen. It kept me hyped up and I always wanted to know what happened next. Had one of the criteria (for scoring) was not up to the mark I would have not enjoyed the show, but I had high expectation from this anime and it lived up to my mark. 
Overall 10/10
For those who haven't seen this anime, please watch it. I promise you the journey of 148 episodes is worth it. It might be a bit slow at the start or seem a bit childish, but don't drop it coz of that. You're gonna miss a true masterpiece. In the end I would thank Yoshihiro Togashi for making an incredible series.
 Thanks for reading till here!",10
"
                This anime is simply a masterpiece. Everthing about it. From the story, to the character development to the ost, this anime does absolutely everything correctly. Hunter x Hunter may seem like a childish, stereotypical shounen anime, but it isn't. Trust me, this anime deserves to be the number one anime on this website. Every single character is perfectly developed, the main character is exactly what a main character should be like, and it has that sense of underlying darkness, but not overwhelmingly so, like other anime tend to do. The animation is amazing too, the fight scenes are vivid and quick paced, and will keep
                  you wanting more. I finished every episode in 2 weeks, i loved it so much. My number 1 anime, of all time.",10
"
                ""When it comes to Chimera Ant I feel it's emblematic of the series as a whole. Togashi has a lot of great concepts but can falter heavily in the execution and can be a bit heavy handed at times in order to get his point across or, worse yet, introduces something interesting only to barely use it or blow it off.
Before Chimera Ant arc I thought the series was okay and I didn't find myself questioning too much because they either explained it (at times over explained it) or I figured it'd eventually get fleshed out and, for the most part, that held true. But
                  the Chimera Ant arc left me scratching my head so early on that I couldn't enjoy it.
Before I get into all the things I didn't like I'd like to point out the things I did. I really liked that Royals different ideas on what's best for the King. One taking an active role in trying to keep the King as is and one following orders and letting the King dictate what's best for him. I liked the Phantom Troupe getting a chance to showcase their abilities and, for the most part, they all had good fights. I loved Meruem's and Komugi's relationship (despite him stacking the deck sooooo hard to make you like Komugi) and the slow change for the King. Knuckle is AWESOME. Really liked Pitou too.
Wing, a teacher of nen and its techniques, explains that forcibly opening nen can be dangerous and if you have even the slightest bit of ill intent you can kill someone doing it. All the ants have theirs opened up in this fashion and none have any repercussions. This could be explained with their bodies being tougher or acting differently but that's just speculation on something that was defined earlier. They also are able to instantly control their nen which means opening and closing their nodes so they don't harm themselves.
The King is evil for the sake of being evil. It's not like the queen was especially cruel. I'd say this is a nature vs. nurture theme if the ants remained static but some ants are born bad, others are born neutral, some are shaped into being better people (the King himself). If this was a theme he was going for it's muddled by the characters action and growth (or lack thereof) so, I have to ask, why is the King evil to begin with?
It hurts the concept behind the nen system. The system is that there's classes you have an affinity for and you can spec into other classes but it won't be as strong as what you're naturally inclined into. It also says that Class A of equal strength could beat Class B of equal strength (there's a whole thing of attack and defense points) while Class A might lose to Class C under the same conditions. It makes it so that you might not really need to have more nen (in comparison to a Dragonball where your bigger number means victory most times). This makes it seem like the class system will be important but The King simply has more nen, the ants abilities aren't ever really counteracted, and the ants are inherently ""stronger"". It made me realize how little this actually comes into play.
Dark does not equal quality. I see too many times how much people applaud this arc because of how dark it gets. To me it detracted because it felt very try hard with the kid killing and brain eating. It never really hit that height again but I found myself kind of turned off by it. Not because of it being dark but because how hard it tried to establish itself as dark.
Too many awesome powers are barely showcased or dismissed quickly. Knuckle is the key offender here as he has an amazing and unique ability, he uses it in his fight against Gon, attatches it to Cheeto (who gets it removed by another ant somehow), and against one of the Royals. Kite has a 9 slot weapon, we see 3 slots (2 being bad draws) and never get to see the others. The ant that could borrow abilities for an hour showcases 2 (maybe 3) abilities and then dies in his first fight.
Why did the bird attack Komugi? That was so forced. Komugi is an established klutz, she could've banged into something and go bird seed in her hair, she could've opened the window and the birds nest be outside, something, ANYTHING.
That's the stuff I remember off the top of my head. To me this is when HxH started to become ""worse One Piece"" to me and from what I hear is going on in the manga that's looking to be the case more and more.""
On top of that too often HxH gets praise for its subversive nature but subversion in and of itself is not a positive nor negative. Something that does something unexpected can surprise you and leave you entertained in a way you didn't think but there's just as much chance it disappoints as you don't get what you want. Beyond that, HxH is not subversive nor deconstructionist, so I don't know why it's believed to be such.",5

                Hunter x Hunter is a series that will you probably see a lot of acclaim for on the internet, and it has a tendency to be warmly received by a lot of people unsatisfied with the writing in most shounen manga.  When it comes to battle shounen that reach the highest of highs and transcend being adolescent power fantasies with mediocre writing and simplistic morals, the two series you will see frequently being praised are HunterxHunter and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. While I get the impression that it's become more common for people to be critical of HunterxHunter due to a variety of reasons (it
                  happens to anything that becomes super popular, people tend to scrutinize it harder since they come in with bigger expectations), I feel that HxH does so much good that it largely deserves its acclaim.
A lot of people unaware of HxH's reputation might mistake the series for a saccharine and light-hearted adventure romp, and they might have good reason to suspect that, given the presence of its main character who appears to be just another idiot shounen hero, not one but two ""mysterious cool guy characters with a secret past"", and another big abrasive dumb guy with an enormously kind heart. The boy wants to find his long-lost father and follow in his footsteps by becoming a ""Hunter"", which is basically a catch-all professional who can perform a wide variety of tasks, but who are usually superpowered in some way. The beginning of the story follows Gon and his band's quest to qualify as Hunters, each with their own personal reasons for doing so. The series' OP is very cheerful, and the soundtrack is a whole is bright and optimistic.
However, upon watching the series it becomes more and more obvious that the series' creator, Yoshihiro Togashi, was not interested in producing a run-of-the-mill battle shounen. 
To begin with, the series isn't just about fighting. Even in just the first arc it's emphasized that Hunters do a lot more than just fight, and the main characters participate in a lot of different competitions that seemingly have nothing to do with one another, like a race, a cooking contest, survival in a jungle, etc. When there IS combat, it's governed by a set of specific rules and conditions pertaining to the intricate ""Nen"" system, which adds a lot of variety in terms of the powers the characters have. In that sense, it's comparable to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure where the characters can have very off-the-wall or seemingly useless abilities that can prove horrifyingly useful.
Other than that, and what I would consider HunterxHunter's biggest strength, is its unpredictability. It not only fails to conform to a lot of expectations in battle shounen, but seems to delight in openly defying or criticizing them. And in doing so, it is nearly always compelling. Its main characters are not the absolute strongest out there and are rarely the central players of any conflict they find themselves in, and what parts they do play often mean they can't brute force their way against the main antagonist of the arc and might not even be able to beat them at all, meaning they have to accomplish their goals through other means.
 Its characters are relatively unique compared to other shounen series. Many shounen series have enormous casts of characters who are superficially interesting or likable but just as many who feel superfluous and irrelevant. Hunter x Hunter also has a large cast but not only does it feel smaller, the majority of the supporting cast has SOMETHING that makes them unique or interesting. In fact, it could be said that Hunter x Hunter later on almost feels like an ensemble piece. As Gon and Killua are often not at the center of conflicts and instead have their own goals and parts to play in the broader narrative, a lot of time is spent on other characters, who sometimes get just as much or even more development than the main characters, whose own development is anything but underwhelming.
In particular, I have to praise the nuanced characterization of Killua, my personal favorite character, who can go from adorable to an absolutely horrifying murderer at the drop of a hat. His relationship with Gon, and both their individual character arcs, forms a strong emotional backbone for the narrative. In addition I have to confess that the development of the villains, particularly the soldier ants in the Chimera Ant arc, was a nice surprise and especially compelling. I won’t say much about it, but some of these characters will likely end up surprising you.
Characters can not only die, but do so frequently, and if they don't die, their actions and mistakes often have long-lasting consequences and affect their development in a significant way. This means that there is a significant tension present in the story, because even if you aren't under the impression that Gon and Killua may actually die, they may NOT achieve their goals or have to live with some sort of horrible failure. 
Which is another thing worth mentioning about this series; not only does it push the envelope in terms of the tropes and story structure it uses, the content in the series is quite shocking in how non-shounen it gets. The series had a number of subversive elements to begin with, like the character Hisoka being a gay pedophile, but the series gets darker and darker as you find out more about the world culminating in the famous Chimera Ant arc which is honestly the darkest, most horrifying and depressing story I have ever seen in a shounen manga. It honest to god does not feel like something that should have been allowed in a shounen magazine, although I'm glad that the author was given license to go that far since it easily works to the arc's benefit.
 The arc seems to have a bit of a controversial reception among the fanbase, likely due to the deteriorating art quality during serialization and several hiatuses, but many, like myself, consider its dark nature a major plus and the arc as a whole to be brilliant even if it is too long for its own good.
The world and scope of the story is completely staggering. The more is revealed about the world the more it seems like we don't know anything at all. It also seems like a haphazard collection of various ideas the author had and wanted to discuss, but it doesn't feel incoherent or distracting, and only makes the world richer. Every single arc of the story has a completely different focus and genre from the previous, from a battle exam arc, a psychological crime thriller, a deadly game, and even unspeakable horror. This is also another significant strength of the show because it offers a lot of variety and it feels like it could potentially deal with any type of story and genre while making it interesting to watch.
And finally, it would be remiss for me not to devote some attention to the exceptional quality of this adaptation of the story in particular. Studio Madhouse deserves some serious props, as this is by far one of the most consistent and well-produced shounen anime adaptations I have ever seen. Not only does it have no ""filler"" (anime original content), it does not abuse flashbacks to the last episodes like certain other anime (cough Naruto cough) to pad out the episode because they don't want to run out of manga content to adapt. There is a lot of ACTUAL animation in the show with the overall visual quality and polish being very well above average, and when it comes to the really important fights and emotional moments you can be sure that this series will deliver in spades.
The series also possesses a highly memorable soundtrack composed by Yoshihisa Hirano, who also worked on Death Note (you might find some of his work here reminiscent of that, especially Chrollo's theme). While it starts off decent, in the more dark and dramatic arcs like Yorkshin and Chimera Ant the compositions become amazing and easily one of the highlights of the show. While I don't care for the opening too much, the ED's are better. In particular, the incredibly hype ""HUNTING FOR YOUR DREAM"" by Galneyrus is widely agreed to be central in many people's enjoyment of the Yorkshin arc.
With all that is so good about the series, I feel much of the criticism that is thrown at it is due to the aforementioned subversive elements in the series. While Togashi's ambitions in deconstructing the elements of most battle shounen are frequently praised and celebrated, it also tends to have the effect of making the endings of arcs in the series feel a bit anti-climactic to some, especially since a lot of them don't end in ways you would expect. This can leave you a bit miffed and unsatisfied, especially given Togashi’s habit of leaving small plot points unresolved from one arc to the other, presumably to be followed up on MUCH later…which is not helped by his habit of taking extremely long breaks, making following the series very difficult for many. In particular, I can think of one admittedly pretty significant development in the Chimera Ant arc that felt like it was written for an entirely different series, but to go into too much detail would involve spoilers. 
Regardless, I feel that HxH brings so much to the table compared to other shounen manga that it’s one of those works you should watch, even if it’s just to have an opinion on it. If nothing else, it is certainly interesting and unique, which is a lot more than many manga and anime can say. It is one of the most consistently enjoyable shounen I have ever read, and while there arcs that are better or more fun than others, and while I have criticisms I could make about various things, in the end the show was so damn enjoyable from start to finish they don’t seem that important.",9

                Hunter x Hunter is a great anime. At first I was hesitant to watch because I did not like the style of Gon's Hair(Gon: Main Character), but this series is so good. The story line is great because he has one goal but, along the way he reaches many obstacles and meets new friends. His will power is also very inspiring. Gon is kind of like Naruto, except that he starts out with pretty much no skill what so ever, where as Naruto has the Nine Tails. Anyway, you should definitely watch this.

                It has been about 4 years since I saw this series, and all this time I have been thinking about how to make a good review on this incredible anime. 
Yes, this anime was very special to me and I want to treat this criticism very carefully in order to express my thoughts well.
                                                   --Minor
                  spoilers--
Story: 10
Our journey begins with a happy tone of adventure, even somewhat childish. The first arc of the series the ""hunter's test"" works as a way to introduce our main and minor characters, and a small glimpse into the world in which these characters will develop in the future.
As for the exam itself, it seemed pretty good to me, it should be noted that at that point in history we really don't know what hunters are like, and one doesn't really know what to expect from a “hunter's exam”. But to give this opinion you have to look back, this is presented as a contest of physical and mental tests, incredibly difficult
This arc also teaches us a bit of the harsh nature of the world we meddle in, but as I said before, even the story is treated in a slightly childish way right now.
Something negative to highlight would be some tests that feel a bit out of place for the seriousness that being a hunter must entail.
This that is presented to us in the first arc of Hunter X Hunter, is basically to characterize our protagonists and villains, and how they interact with each other and with the rest of the world, even giving small sightings of things that will be presented to us later in the series, so that everything feels more organic in the future.
(Now I will cover the rest of the arches in a more summarized way)
As for the second arc of it may be one of the most underrated in the series, personally it is not one of my favorites either, but it is necessary to conclude that this arc works perfectly to reinforce the friendship and the bond that unites our protagonists.
The third arc Works around introducing us to the power system of the series, one of the best planned and explained power systems in anime, to tell the truth, from now on the whole plot revolves around this power, the “Nen ”, And later we realize that without him there would be no Hunter X Hunter.
What can be said about the arc of ""Yorknew"" or ""Yorkshin"" surely here we will be introduced to one of the best groups of anime villains. The famous Phantom Troop, so intriguing and deadly, made us all fall in love.
Apart from that, here we can see how Nen works in practice, and that, in this world, being ""strong"" does not mean ensuring victory in a Nen battle.
Greed Island, is also a fairly underrated arc, since it is between two monsters such as Yorknew and Chimera Ants, this arc serves as a training arc, where our protagonists will specialize in their Nen.
The sixth arc of Hunter X Hunter must be one of the most loved arcs not only in this anime, but in the entire anime in general, how incredible and complex this saga is left me speechless, many people also detest this arc for how slow the fights are and how detailed the story is, but for me it was an example of what a good writer Togashi is.
Surely one of the best villains in anime was formed in this arc, one of the saddest deaths in anime was formed in this arc, and one of the best power ups I saw.
The last arc, it is a bit uncomfortable, it ends in a very open way, since what follows later in the manga was not adapted to the anime, but I will not delve into the manga, simply the last arc served as a conclusion to the goal of our protagonist, Gon.
In conclusion, believe that the story of Hunter X Hunter is one of the most complex and careful of the Shonen, without a doubt with plot twists that you do not see coming, therefore a series that is not at all predictable in my opinion. Not counting the ending of the anime that leaves much to be desired, and some mistakes that the 2011 adaptation made regarding the manga, it is without a doubt an incredible story.
Art: 8
The work of Mad House in this adaptation, I think is impeccable, it is not the best animation without a doubt, but it is very good, and you can see the improvement in visual quality as the chapters go by, especially if you compare the latter with the former.
Sound: 8
For me one of the best ost of anime is Hunter X Hunter, the famous ost of ""Kingdom of Predators"" (yes, the one with memes) seems to me a masterpiece.
Apart from that good music and atmosphere, when there is action, music does its job accentuating it, when there is mystery, it also provides good music to get into the atmosphere. There is not much to add other than this.
The only bad thing that I put here is the repetitive use of some ost on certain occasions, I am very much in favor of using music only in key moments, and there are times when this breaks for me.
Characters: 10
Gon: Very good protagonist, at the beginning he may be the generic shonen boy who has a goal to fulfill, but as the story passes, the way of seeing this character changes completely.
Killua: Surely everyone's favorite, the complexity of this character left us all perplexed, a good supporting character, and complements Gon very well.
Leorio: Togashi's forgotten character, leorio's personality is quite funny and noble, I wish he had more development in the anime.
Kurapika: very well developed in the series, even with an arc dedicated to him, with one of the best skills in anime.
Meruem: One of the best villains in anime, at first it would seem that he has no purpose, but then he will find a reason that will make him the character we all love.
Hisoka: quite a peculiar Villain, personally, I do not even consider him a villain, but without a doubt one of the characters with the most extravagant and charismatic personality in anime.
Enjoyment: 9
What a great trip it was to see this anime, although at first it did not capture my attention so much, then I fell in love with this series, the feeling of adventure I felt when watching it, and the emotion that it gave me is unmatched, without a doubt I would pay to forget it and see it from scratch.
Overall: 10
This anime is almost perfect, I totally recommend it if you are looking for something different shonen, and an extensive adventure, I assure you that you will fall in love with this Anime, you will thank me later ;).
Thanks for reading my review, and I'm sorry for how extensive it was.",10

                Ok... so why 3 overall ? well, watching this show, while skipping the intro + the startup falshback of what just happened in the episode beforehand, + skipping the ""episodes that just put alot of episodes into one"" weird ass thingy, i needed to watch each episode at the max speed that my computer could andle playing while still processing sound. And they were still talking way too much way too often, every 5 to 10 seconds a character starts thinking for 3 minutes or start speaking about boring ass shit for like 5 minutes, and even sped up, some sequences are still taking super
                  long to get to the point ! Sometimes, they would just play rock paper cisors, and start speaking for 10 minutes about what strategy is better to use in rock paper cisors but in such zero dynamism way that could make a royal guard sleep or a astronaut sleep i dont fucking know. Like, seriously, they are talking all the time. ALL. THE. TIME. + there is like 500 episodes, you really think im gonna watfch this piece of garbage ? hummmmmm no thanks. im gonna watch something like dirty pair instead.Oh and i want to add, that like, some episodes LEGIT, are basicly them doing nothing in a closed room, for the all episode and the only plot points are like... some ugly dude feets are stinky. REALLY.",3

                This anime is something everyone should watch before they die. I believe that Hunter X Hunter (2011) should be used as a base for what all anime should be compared to. ""On a scale from 1 to HxH, how good was it?"" Why do I say this? Because Hunter X Hunter has qualities that anime these days strongly lack. Now, the length of the anime surely helps to allow amazing character development. Some people might think long animes are a turn-off, and I agree. Usually.
Hunter X Hunter is the only exception. The episodes flew by so fast, and all merged together into one beautiful stream,
                  one glorious story. Gon and Killua represent everything you would want in an anime character, which says a lot since they are so different from each other, but at the same time complete each other. I could not recommend any other anime as strongly as this one! Please do yourself a favor and start watching now!",10
"
                No, I will not be talking about spoilers because I want everyone who still has not seen this masterpiece to go in with as little knowledge as possible. In fact, I feel the BEST way to enjoy this series is with as little knowledge going into it and as little expectations as possible. But nowadays that's nearly impossible due to the fact that you're online. Me giving this show a 10 already contradicts my point. Anyway I'm writing this for people who are still on the fence about the show and want to know what the appeal is so here we go.
This is the most
                  unique shounen I have ever seen in the story and characters department. Hunter X Hunter is my favorite anime of all-time and is what really got me into the anime medium (similar to when people watch Naruto or Dragon Ball) I watched Naruto and Dragon Ball before watching HxH but those never really made me want to go out there and watch other genres like HxH made me feel. HxH was the anime that opened my mind to watching more anime genres. The show definitely has some typical shounen troupes (which I don't mind), but it was so different from every other anime I had ever seen that it had got me hooked. This show has one of the most passionate fan bases I've ever been a part of and it's for good reason. Let's get this review started.
Actually one more thing, this show has essentially no fan service. Now I don't hate fanservice as long as it doesn't interfere with the main story, but Hunter X Hunter not having any fanservice whatsoever just felt more mature. Like the show was respecting itself in some sort of weird way I don't know I appreciated it
Story: The world of HxH is huge filled with all kinds of unique creations, locations, concepts, and creatures. It feels unfathomably grand. The first arc in HxH made me feel like I was watching the original Dragon Ball again. The show was charming, timeless, adventurous and innocent. This is something I miss in modern shounen. Right off the bat, I was starting to fall in love with this series. Nowadays it's more about what the next power-up is as opposed to the next adventure that awaits them. HxH's adventurous tone was something I was missing and I was absolutely loving it.
Before we move onto the second arc, I want to highlight how seamless every arc flows feels like an actual story funny enough. In most anime, after every arc feels like a story in itself. While this is somewhat true for Hunter X Hunter, it all flows really nicely which makes the show easy to marathon through. Also, there is no time skips in this series. It just flows. Time just goes by instead of skip. Don't get me wrong I love time skips, they add hype and change a lot in the story but this again helps Hunter X Hunter feel fresh and unique compared to other shounen.
Now moving on into the second arc where Gon and Killua are introduced to Nen in the Heavens Arena. This is by far the best use of an anime power system. The more Nen someone has doesn't mean anything. It's all about how you creatively use your Nen to outwit the other person. It's also amazing how Togashi manages to fit so much personality with each Nen ability. Every ability in the series was tailored to that character specifically and it's truly amazing to experience I love the power system. It allows for a lot of unique and diverse fights which make the show never get repetitive but aside from that, the Heavens Arena arc was kinda lame to me. There's a sweet fight scene but that was it really. There wasn't really anything too interesting in this arc so let's move on.
The 3rd arc was where this show became my favorite anime of all time. This is where the best villain group of all-time makes their debut. I'll be talking more about them in the characters part of the review. Overall this arc was amazing, the characters were fantastic and this was where we really get to understand the true motivations and resolve for the main figures in the story. It felt like all the previous arcs were just leading up to this one. Lots of action and overall a fantastic arc. I'd be getting spoiler territory if I were to go any further so I'll stop.
Let's just skip the 4th arc because it was essentially a training arc and to go over some details would be heading into spoiler territory. Anyway, I loved Biskey. She's one of my favorite characters in the show for sure.
The final arc I'm going to talk about is the Chimera Ant arc. This is where shit gets real!!! This arc in the show reveals one of the most interesting villains of all Shounen ""The Ant King"" is one of the best and certainly most interesting take on the whole ""learning to be human"" and ""who am I really"" philosophy. His character development through this arc is nothing short of pure brilliance. The entire arc does an amazing job at building up the action scenes and making them as epic as possible. The narrator did admit-ably get somewhat annoying though. Also, things did slow down too slow a little bit too much in my opinion. And this is coming from someone who marathoned the whole show in a week and a half. Throughout the arc, we see different sides of some characters which also makes you question who is really the good guys. Which is amazing storytelling in my opinion. It makes the story feel like it was just a bunch of people being people and not good guys vs bad guys. Makes the story more realistic. By the end, I honestly didn't know who to cheer for.
Characters: Gon is your typical Shounen main character. Stubborn, childish ignorant etc. Unlike other Shounen main characters, he isn't born with some unfair advantage. He is talented indeed. 1 in 10 million talent I believe. But he isn't some sort of ""chosen one"" or anything. His family is legendary but people don't really recognize him at the moment. He's just another human. He wants to find his dad which is kind of a lame goal (kinda glad he doesn't want to become chaiman of the hunter association or anything like that). Good thing most of the show doesn't revolve around that goal. 
Despite being the main character, Gon lost many of his fights which isn't normal in Shounen. He's also a forest boy which keeps him lovable. Luckily, because of his simple character, I am able to enjoy the other more deep and complex characters more. His morals and motivations were unclear to me in the first time watching but after rewatching the show twice now, I understand him more and he is a surprisingly complex character. He embodies a child with his behavior and actions which weren't readily apparent the first watch. Gon is also one of the only MCs of a shounen anime I actually like joining the likes of Goku and Luffy. People like to say he goes through some sort of character development but I never understood that. He doesn't develop into anything. In the last episode, he's the same character as in the first. He simply goes through a character phase which leads into major spoilers so I won't go over it,
Next up is Killua who comes from a family of assassins. Gon and Killua are best friends despite seemingly coming from a completely different manga, but it works well because they work off each other so perfectly. Gon accepting Killua despite dark and sadistic ways. It shows that Gon doesn't care about your past. He just cares about where you are now. Killua accepts Gon because it's his first real friend and he brings out the best in himself. The 2's friendship is beautifully presented. They don't let each others differences become a reason to not be friends. Killua seemed like sort of a blind fan towards the end but Gon was really all he had and he wanted to protect it no matter what. They are really just kids at the end of the day which people tend to forget. Killua comes from a family of assassins and rejects everything about them. Right now you could say he's just a kid who just wants to play. Whether he will shift his character and become an assassin is unlikely yet still possible. This is where he and Gon differ. Killua is locked up with his family controlling everything. Gon has all the freedom ever. He wants the freedom Gon has. He wants to live his own life. He strives to be like Gon. Gon truly is the light for Killua. For someone who has never had a friend before he's pretty good at being one himself. For a majority of the series, Killua does not know his purpose. He just knows he doesn't want to be with his family.
Let's talk about the villains, first off the Phantom Troupe. It's obvious from the start that there's something different about this group compared to other Shounen anime groups. These guys are stocked to be criminals. Most villainous groups would sit down somberly lamenting the existence of the heroes and what the best way to dispose of them is. The phantom troupe, on the other hand, are shotgunning beers and playing cards whilst doing their task. There's kind of a mutual friendship between them. You can tell through their actions and dialogue that they've been through a lot together and enjoy each other's company. Their comradery is also something to respect. They will go to hell and back for each other. Most other villain groups don't care for each other. These guys do and it only adds more to this already awesome villain group. They also all have their unique quirks and charm to them that gives them a weird sense a balance. Each character feels so unique yet so charming.
Let's talk about the other villains. I love how the main villains (apart from Hisoka) of the show don't care about Gon. They just mind their own business. Gon doesn't really come in contact with the main villains. I don't think Gon or Killua even speak a word to the Ant King. (Speaking of the Ant King he is the best/most well-developed character in the series.) The side characters are the ones who are in conflict with the villain which is something not only unique but also beautiful. Gives them a chance to shine. The main characters are usually caught up in conflicts with the side (not as powerful) villains. The main characters aren't very strong in the grand scheme of the story. They aren't weak by any means but they are often overwhelmed. This is a great way to develop the side characters while also having the main characters grow and become strong. There isn't any pure evil nor is there pure good. The characters have so many levels of depth that you sometimes forget who is good and bad. I really appreciated this as it made the show seem as if it were a show about real people as opposed to good guys vs bad guys. Nobody's perfect. We see the evil and good parts in both the heroes and villains.
Something I found really odd about this show is that absolutely no one is afraid of death or even hesitates to kill. It does make the show feel less real and more make-believe. I know this is a fake story but I just went on praising the show about how real every character felt and how they were actual human beings but now I'm talking about this common human aspect everyone seems to lack. I don't mind it, it would take away from some of the awesome moments in the show if they second-guessed themselves 
Art: This show is beautifully animated for a show with 148 episodes. It makes the manga look like trash. The fight scenes are great and everything. Absolutely no complaints
Sound: This show has a lot of memorable soundtracks that fit every scene of the show perfectly. However, the opening got boring listening to it 148 times over and some of the minor arcs had some forgettable tracks.
Enjoyment: If you couldn't tell, I enjoy this show A LOT! The only problem is that some there isn't enough fights and when there were fights, they were often one-sided. I'm not the type of guy who just loves fights all the time but there were a bunch of fights teased throughout the show that never happened. 
Speaking of fights, I love the way this anime uses music to make the fights stand out. Or rather the lack thereof. It makes the few fights we do have all the more epic. Sometimes there will be epic music pumping in the background of some spectacular animation, or sometimes there will be nothing at all and we just see some badass martial arts complemented by nothing but the sound of raw fists.
Overall: This show is the pinnacle of anime. This show deserves all the praise it receives. It's a testament to the show how most people's main critique to the show is how there isn't enough of it.
Individual Arc review scores:
Hunter Exam/Zoldyck Family Arc: 9.5
Heaven's Arena Arc: 8.5
York New City Arc: 10
Greed Island Arc: 8.5
Chimera Ant Arc: 10
13th Chairman Arc: 9.5
Mean score: 9.33
But if you take into account that the Hunter Exam/Zoldyck Family, York New, Chimera Ant, and 13th Chairman arcs take up 119 out of the 148 episodes, the mean score is closer to 9.5. And then when you consider the good moments stick with me and HEAVILY outweight the bad (I mean there's 148 episodes, ofc some stuff is gonna be bad) it's closer to a 9.8 or 9.9. Some REALLY minor points stop it from being a 10 but regardless, it's my favorite anime.",10

                *This review does not include any spoilers*
Story:
So, the story involves a 12-year old boy named Gon who wants to be a hunter just like his dad. Gon sets off to find him, since his father left him to become a hunter. On Gon's adventure he meets some people, those who have the same ambition, but want to use it for a different goal or objective.
Characters:
The characters are what makes this show so amazing for me. The main characters are well-developed along with some villains which are really interesting. The villains are likable and calm. Most of the times villains can be really annoying and irritating
                  in shounen anime, however that's not the case with this one. 
Hunter x Hunter does a good job between keeping a balance between the personalities of the villains, which I don't see very often. 
Animation:
Personally, I like the character designs and they're very different compared to each other. The backgrounds are done well and the animation is really good, especially with the fight scenes.
Sound: 
The soundtracks that I've heard in this show are one of the greatest ones I ever heard in any anime. They also keep a balance with the instruments that they use, so there is a lot of variety. The opening is really catchy, but one of the best things of this anime are the endings. I never skipped them and I usually do that with most of the anime's. 
Enjoyment:
I was watching Hunter x Hunter literally 24/7. I was also so excited and they never disappointed me. The arcs are different compared to each other. With most of the shonen anime's the arcs start to get a little reiterative. The most exciting thing was to watch Gon and Killua grow and develop. Hopefully, the mangaka of the series starts writing again!
Overall: 10/10
If you like an adventure anime and some dark stories, then this is definitely something for you! Let me know what you think of this anime!
Thank you for your time and I hope you will start watching this anime soon if you haven't done that yet

                HxH is one of those shounen anime which are both well written and well executed.I just completed this anime so it'll be easy for me to express my thoughts(this review is completely based on my opinions,so you have all the rights to disagree with me).
I wont give any major spoilers but there can be minor spoilers in my review.
STORY- 10
Unlike most shounens HxH is unpredictable. Its story is not as unique as FMAB but its also not as predictable as Fairy tail or other generic shounen. Let me explain, So basically HxH is divided into 7 Arcs:
1.Hunter Exam Arc
2.Zoldyck Family Arc 
3.Heavens Arena Arc
4.Yorknew City
                  Exam Arc
5.Greed Island Arc
6.Chimera Ant Arc
7.13th Hunter Chairman Election Arc
In the first 2-3 arcs, even though the story is good, you wont feel anything special about this anime.If you're not a shounen fan, these arcs can be a problem. But at the same time as you proceed you would realize that these arcs were important for the character development of this series.The actual fun part of this series begins from Yorknew City Exam Arc.
The best Arc of this series is Chimera Ant Arc (its also one of the most well written arc I've ever seen).
For me, any anime along with good story,it should have a good ending. HxH has an outstanding story and also ,even though not great but, a satisfying ending.The story continues in manga but I think the anime also ended at a good note.
ART-9
The Art & Animation in this series is great. I like how the animation in the first few arcs was so light and there are not much gory scenes.But as the series proceeds the tone changes and suddenly there is more bloodshed and gore on the screen.The change of tone of animation is done so perfectly that you wont even notice.
SOUND-8
The Osts and other sound tracks of HxH is not as great as FMAB or Naruto
but its good.
CHARACTER-10
The characters of HxH are same as most shounens, i.e.
We have the main protagonist Gon Freecss who is friendly,optimistic and helpful in nature.He is strong in combat but is a weak strategist.So basically he is Naruto of HxH!!
Then we have Killua Zoldyck who is smart,cunning and a good strategist.He is Gon's best friend so basically you can call him Sasuke of HxH(before leaving konoha, jk!).
Then there are Leorio and Kurapika who are also among the good friends of Gon.
But the most interesting character (what I think) is Hisoka, the main antagonist of the series. He is not the generic villian of a shounen like Frieza who just wants to defeat the hero and wants to show everyone that how powerful they are.He is like the Joker of anime who does want to defeat and kill his enemies but only if they are worthy enough. In fact there is a part in the series where he fights along side Gon for a competition. 
The character development of this series is magnificent! The writers gave enough time to each character as the story proceeds which eventually pays off for the series.
TLDR: HxH is one of the best shounen anime out there with a great unpredictable Story, great Animation, decent Music and an outstanding Character development.Its a MUST WATCH.",10
"
                Watched four seasons of this after a friend gave it glowing reviews. I can't say I agree that it's all that good. It's actually a strange watching experience, because you've got these really cool characters, well-designed--and then most have names so bad they literally sound like the names a small child would come up with. Shalnark. The assassin boy is Killua. Kurapika. The list goes on. And the ones that are kind of cool are pronounced really obnoxiously. And it's a great example of what plagues this show: It just falls short in weird areas. Establishes crazy huge arcs--then ends them extremely anti-climactically. Has a
                  really great concept for a season--then changes style and direction completely. If it actually was written by an eight year old, it's wildly impressive and somebody please correct me. Otherwise, very oddly underwhelmed.",5
"
                This review contain spoilers.
Animation: 8.5
I think that Madhouse did an excellent job by animating Hunter x Hunter. The studio does always make a really good job in animating characters and in showing their emotion. I think that is the strongest point here. Otherwise wasn't Hunter x Hunter that much of an animationorgasm, there were some hights and pretty good and smoothly animated fights but mostly it was not that overwhelming. 
Story: 10 
The story itself is pretty simple. A twelve year old boy is searching his dad... wow. Likewise is the world building of HxH simple but great. It is like our world but with
                  some extras until ep. 148. But what makes the story a masterpiece is how it is told and there is espacielly one Arc that stands out: The Chimera Ant Arc.
The best Shounen Arc i've ever watched which reflects the deep abysses of humanity.
Characters: 10
Where do I start? The characters are probably the best HxH has to offer espacielly the antagonists are excellent. Of course the protagonists are also great where i liked gon the most who has become on of my favourite main protagnists in anime due to his development in the chimera ant arc. But as I said it's the antagonists that make up this anime. More specifically: Chrollo, Hisoka and Meruem. 
Of those three amazing characters i liked Meruem the most. He is for me the best antagonists that exisits in anime. How he transformed from an invincible monster to a person that only needs one word to find his inner peace is just incredible.
Sound: 10
Hunter x Hunter has one of the best soundtracks i have ever heard. It is unique and fits perfectly in every scene. I would here to highlight the soundtrack of the phantom troupe which has made some episodes to a masterpiece (ep.51).
Enjoyment: 9.5
Actually there would be also a 10/10 here too but i didn't like the Greed island Arc so much. Nonetheless every episode was enjoyable and some of them where one of the episodes i have ever seen (Ep. 51, 111, 112, 116, 126, 131, 134, 135). 
Overall: 10
Overall Hunter x Hunter is the best shounen arc i have ever watched. Maybe the best anime i have ever watched with amazing characters, ingenious story telling and a great soundtrack.",10
"
                Basically, this was the most important anime for my critical formation on various factors, of course, impressing me as well... How does a 148-episode work have such a stable and absurdly wonderful production all the time? I can't forget the role of the manga's author, Yoshihiro Togashi, who created everything in a magnificent way and almost gave life to the so real characters.
Practically everything in this anime works like a ""game"". First the rules are presented and then, they're developed and broken. Also, the characters are disposable, in other words, they don't have to appear in all the arcs (even the main character), some even
                  die very spontaneously, showing a balance of functions and needs within the work.
The themes, mainly in the Chimera Ants Arc, are constructed in a glorious form attached to the direction and narration. Togashi hits the society shit on the fan.
Hunter X Hunter, the greatest subversion to ""Shounen"", certainly deserves your time.",10

                MASTERPICE~~!!! YOU CANNOT DREAM OF BETTER ANIME THAN HxH!!!! Since Ive watched quite a lot of those shounen anime, this one is just like 10/10 of all parameters. Even my favorite Fairy Tail didnot awake emotions that HxH did!! Actually you just live through lives of characters, you feel happy/depressed/frustrates/kawaiii and you know you never regret the time you spent on that brilliant!! The contrast is perfect, story is PERFECT AF, opening and music are just SPECTACULAR, i want to meet this composer and give him a big hug!!:D All my feelenigs cannot fit into this small review, but anyway... WATCH IT!!! TASTE IT!!! FEEL
                  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HxH and all you have seen till now!! And later you say that my review was supehelpful and send me a big thanks for this reccomendation!!:D Gooood luck and have at least 1 week of nice time watching this candy!!!",10

                ""Human life is too long to devote to reproduction yet too short to devote to learning. Perhaps that is why humans succumb to desire and thus seek release. Despite the fact that life is complete with the sun, the land, and poetry."" -- The real Supreme Leader Diego
What follows is my first ever review for an anime series. I've watched it two times. In short, it is a masterpiece.
The story is fantastic. The 'arcs' of hxh are nothing like One Piece or Bleach. The ebb and flow in each story's development is unpredictable, and will leave the viewers' puny attempts at guessing the course in
                  the dirt. Sometimes, such a juicy plot bomb is dropped, that you have to pause and marvel at how carefully the threads of various details led to a certain conclusion. The author doesn't care for going easy on you, so you will feel every bump on the heroes' journey as your own, and you will feel deeply for the characters. The fights are intelligent, emotionally intense, and often completely unpredictable. The breadth and depth of themes is arguably the most ambitious of any anime I've seen: the sacrifices of friendship, the meaning of struggle, the cost of love, the nature of humanity, and many, many more.
The comedy, the training sub-arcs, the raw emotion: everything is well-thought out. The characters' emotional reactions are much more believable than in your standard shonen. The tropes (e.g., ""kill me please"", ""bad guys work alone"", etc.) are destroyed mercilessly in the process, and the world is better for it. God, so much better.
Character design is amazing. Almost all characters have meaning. You really need to see for yourself the many ways in which they shine. The initial appearances are already enough for you to fall instantly in love with many of them, and just as quickly hate some others. Gon and Killua make for a fantastic and very balanced duo. I absolutely adore Netero, Kite, Bisky, Tsubone and many others. They stand out even at first, but the real magic happens with character development. You will come to feel for the villains, which are nothing like your standard regurgitated shonen tropes. Wait till you see Chrollo Lucifer or marvel at Meruem's transformation. Even the much maligned Bomber has his purpose. The simplistic notions of villainy and heroism are cast aside, and what we get is a riveting psychological study of the rich tapestry of a world, whose every element is a living, breathing, and vibrant existence.
Honestly, the soundtrack and pacing could have been better at some points. But. This is eye-popping character design of Bleach (note: NOT character development, which Bleach lacks pretty much entirely), emotional intensity of Attack on Titan, strategic subtlety of Death Note, riveting fights of some of Naruto's best ones, and the intellectual depth that simply has no rivals in anime, unless you pick up a (really good) book. I really think this anime is the closest thing we have to The One, The True, The Ultimate that this medium has to offer. Its few flaws become endearing, to the point that approaching the end of the series is the most dreaded part in the whole process.
I simply can't see it ever being surpassed.",10
"
                Hunter X Hunter is one of the best shonen anime ever (if not the best). There is no ""power of friendship"" or plot armor here to save you, so you can expect the unexpected.
The anime starts slowly and goofy, with the MC, Gon Freecs, being a happy-go-lucky character. He leaves home with the purpose of becoming a Hunter in order to one day find his dad, which is missing since Gon was 2 years old. You are going to see that HxH is different from any other shonen anime you have ever watched. If what you are looking for is an anime with non-stop action,
                  then HxH will often look anti-climatic, but that is the point. Togashi is a master in creating these legendary moments to shock the audience by subverting their expectations of the story or character development, but at the same time, he lays them a trail of clues within the narrative along the way to that subversion.
Nen is a technique that allows a living being to use and manipulate their own life energy and is the most complex and well written ""power"" from any other anime or show (such as haki, ki, chakra etc).
The story is excellent and it doesn't have to rely on explosions or huge breasted women to keep going. The results of the slow progression rewards you beyond belief, you'll be taken through so many loops, it is going to be a roller coaster of emotions. It will make you question the most explicate of details. Even though it starts goofy you will see that with each arc, the story gets darker and darker. The Chimera Ant arc (the latest and best arc) is EXTREMELY dark, it hits you out of nowhere in this bright world of Hunter x Hunter, and it stays a dark world from there on out, it's amazing.
10/10 I recommend watching.",10
"
                Hunter x Hunter is great and outstanding. Even though the first couple of episodes are a bit underwhelming, and not very well adapted, I think the series excels at so many things, which after watching the whole thing allow you to see and perceive the value of everything along with the perfect build-up of the world. A world that is just fascinating and highly immersive.
The characters are all top tier, and the presence of each one of them is used in moderation and is not forced at all, producing a lot more unique and lasting perceptions on them, it is just really outstanding, and you
                  are guaranteed to love the characters, there are just so many great characters, both protagonists, and antagonists, and support characters are really good. The development of every character is really smooth, and genius, and it is delightful seeing the way each character can influence, and mold the plot into a really complex, and intriguing world, all the same having great and really interesting complex interactions between each of the characters. Altogether you are guaranteed to bond to at least one or more of the character and develop opinions on them all, which is just how good they all are.
The story demonstrates its mastery of the world build-up, with just the right amount of everything. When you get into a really mindblowing arc, there is always a great transition arc following it, which at the same time opens up the question mark for new mysteries, and a short break from really intense genius story arcs. The symbolism is not left aside and is present through the story on so many strategic occasions, with really subtle, almost unconscious foreshadowing to what is to come, alongside allusions, and life lessons about us humans, and the world we live in; explicit contrasts, crossed paths, and parallel journeys, pushing the audience into reflecting about the meaning of things, and what is it, that a given situation, character, group, or result is telling us. Ten out of 10 for world and setting build-up
One more of the many strengths that I regard to the series is without a doubt the basis of the story and plot,  rooting to the nature of the world build-up, and the diverse scenarios, which successfully create a sense of logic to the major events, turning points, and plot build ups that we see in the series. The presence of Nen, the nature of morality, our protagonists, that journeys o each character, and the experiences that share, and fins together, all come together to form a flawless engaging story, successfully achieving a great connection between the audience and the story, granting meaning to every event, while making the audience feel that everything is there for a reason, and it all makes sense.
The last thing I will say about the show is the fact that it accomplishes a great feat, of having a piece for everybody, and anybody. What I mean is that the show is easy to enjoy, and find something you can relate to, and bind to in this show, and there is just the perfect rationing for everything that adds up to create this magnificent and unique world. The world of Hunter x Hunter.
Overall, Hunter x Hunter is a great show and an actual masterpiece; yet, it is far from perfect, therefore it cannot be called perfect, Nevertheless, it stands out from many other shows, and it separates from the common trend, ultimately creating a unique show, going beyond common shounen anime, and what a show itself is able to accomplish, transcending the limits of our screens. A show that I've come to love, and is known as Hunter x Hunter.
PD: if you noticed I didn't mention anything about the ending, it is because it is still ongoing, and on Hiatus to this day.",10
"
                Okay one thing i fail to understand is that why does not this masterpiece has a Huge fanbase as of like Naruto,bleach etc For I know this anime has been the best out of 373 anime shows I have watched .The Story is superb the action is awesome and the characters are ridiculously mind blowing it competes with some of those overly popular shows and in many aspects defeat them,However the Chimera arc was a little bit frustrating I felt that it was elongated for no reason but that makes a very little part of the whole anime 
I rate this anime 11/10 ",10
"
                The standout feature of Hunter x Hunter is strong abstract reasoning.  Togashi reveals a wide breadth of interest and good knowledge of fundamentals.  Understanding an idea and applying it in a natural way is harder than it looks.  HxH is full of entertaining games, contests, and puzzles.
One character has a unit limit of 216, equal to (2x3)^(3).  Writers with weak maths default to numbers like 250.  Hisoka’s card trick in the colosseum is an algebra problem. I doubt I’m the only one who paused for the satisfaction of solving it first.  The difficulty level is accessible to the audience.
                   Killua’s manipulation of reflexes is fun biology.  It hits a “seems plausible” sweet spot and accurately describes how the neurological command system works.  Carbon dioxide asphyxiation is relevant in one scene.  HxH uses it properly, times the reveal delightfully, and finishes with appropriate detail, explaining that the relative concentration matters, not just the presence of the gas.  Togashi is skilled at strategy games like shogi and go.  You can tell by his comments on player psychology.  He applies game theory directly, not just in toy situations: the Zoldyck family professional philosophy of risk aversion is a good example.  The election arc includes valuable insight on the mentality of a masterful game player.
Adept analytical skills tend not to mix with potent people skills and Togashi is no exception.  The vast majority of Hunter x Hunter’s characters have one or two personality traits.  HxH borrows liberally: you have seen these personalities many times before.  Design is a mishmash of tropes (e.g. Neferpitou) and clothing (e.g. Phinks) that often conflicts in tone with the character’s role in the story.  Each arc removes most of the previous side characters and introduces many more.  This rotation shields Togashi from the challenge of developing side characters further.  He does a creditable job with one main character.  The other has some of the worst character progression I’ve seen in a while.  Togashi’s middling understanding of human nature keeps HxH from being a masterpiece.
Hunter x Hunter is still a great story.  Togashi’s abstract wisdom is worth a lot.  Scene after scene reflects philosophical truths about the world.  Here’s one: there is no “right side” and “wrong side.”  Everyone stands up for their brethren.  Justice to one person is injustice to another.  Against a backdrop of one-dimensional protagonists, the Spider and Meruem stand out.  At times, their behavior is unequivocally evil.  However, Togashi refuses to keep it that simple.  He honours them.  They have virtue.  Their dreams matter.  HxH invites us to care about them, and we do, sometimes deeply.  This embeds a profound lesson about the tragedy of life into the story.  These antagonists are magnificent.
Anime-specific:
The music is very good.  Some songs don’t match thematically (e.g. “Kyrie eleison” is a poor fit in scenes where it is used).
Significant stretches have inefficient exposition.  This mainly occurs during the Chimera Ant arc, which has a lot of atrocious material for a story whose core is good.  Outside of this arc, HxH is not oppressively draggy.
The directors give special attention to key emotional moments of the star antagonists.  Well played.
Hunter x Hunter is an excellent watch.",8
"
                I'll try to make this short and sweet, and down to the point, for those wondering whether, or not, to watch this show. Short answer, yes! Reasons why? Read on.
So I'll start with this: ""At least watch the first 24 episodes, and then see how you like it."", that quote is roughly something I read from someone else before I watched this show and I can tell you that just after the first episode I was hooked, and I'm sure that you'll get hooked too.
Anyway getting to the actual show, as you can see I've rated this a 10, which it's well deserved, Yoshihiro Togashi,
                  the man behind this show, has created a masterpiece with Hunter x Hunter. Some of you may know him for another one of his popular works too, that being ""Yuu☆Yuu☆Hakusho"".
(Hunter x Hunter = HxH)
Story / Characters:
The story for HxH is very well done, with the show consisting of the major plot surrounding Gon, one of the main characters alongside, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio.
Each character has their own significant importance, with that being anything ranging from their backstory to their goals, their motivations. All of the characters have a detailed backstory, so you'll understand their aspiration to become ""Hunters"".
While Gon and Killua have the most prominent involvement in the story, don't fret, Kurapika and Leorio also play major parts as, they too, are main characters. While Gon and Killua set out to achieve their goals and Kurapika and Leorio do the same, they group splits up for a period of time, while they each make names for themselves.
The further the story continues, the more sucked in and attached you become, the darker the story becomes, the greater the ordeal, for the characters, becomes. Don't get the wrong mindset that it's all fun and games, with arcs of the story becoming darker by the episode, you won't be able to stop from watching ""just one more episode"", you'll want to see the climax, the conclusion, you won't be satisfied until you do.
Also as the arcs change more characters are introduced with quite major roles too, as one would expect. These characters also have their own motivations that become intertwined with the main characters, helping and assisting them along the way.
Oh and if you're worried about the main characters being ""too op"", then don't. They win fights, they lose fights, they accept that, and they train. There are also many characters who outrank them, in terms of power, skill, and experience, and they accept that, they know they don't stand a chance, especially if they just run straight in without thinking. If they do come to a situation where they do rush in without thinking it through or not knowing the severity of the situation they're getting themselves into, they're very quickly, taught it by having to live with the excruciating consequences of their actions.
Art / Sound: 
Okay, so I don't really have much to put here, and to keep this as short as possible, I'll tell you this, the Art and Sound are absolutely amazing.
For the Art, it's truly amazing, very highly detailed, adding another layer of depth to the show, and you're never left with a moment thinking ""Wait, what's going on, why are these colours all splashing together?!"", it's very clear and all just flows together.
For the Sound, it too is outstanding. Just like with the art, it adds a new layer of depth, changing with the mood of the characters or the atmosphere of the environment, you'll always feel immersed. A situation where a characters life is on the line? The situation will become obscure with a tense feeling, that you too, will be able to feel.
Just in case: TL;DR - You really can't go wrong with this Anime, truly a masterpiece. An outstanding story, which you'll want more of after the 148 episodes come to a close. 
A very enjoyable Anime, would definitely recommend watching. Don't miss out on this truly amazing adventure, watch the show, and enjoy the ride!",10

                NOTE THIS IS NOT A PROPER REVIEW, IT’S MORE OF A PLACE WHERE I CAN DUMP MY THOUGHTS OF HXH. 
Hunter exams is a pretty strong introduction to HxH.
Filled with mind battles (Lady quizzer, Gon chasing
kiriko, candle game, Gon formulating a plan to
acquire hisoka's tag, illumi imposing on killua.) And I
don't believe it to be visually blanned either. It
definetely isn 't as ambitious visually compared to
other arcs. But manages to create a fitting tone.And the simple characterization to characters such as
Gon, Leorio, Hisoka, Kurapika, Killua, and Illumi
work very well. It makes them feel like humans, it's
not extremely creative or characterization that would
leave an impact but it's something necessary and
done well.
Hisoka does so well in imposing his character on
other's and the way they react makes his presence
even more real. He's a jester, playful, guileful and
unpredictable. And it offers nice character
interactions between Hisoka and the others.
And I believe it sets the tone of HxH very well
something which would be full of adventure,
creative, and endless possibilities. It's use of imagery
is also pretty cool such as the hemotrophic butteHlies
which represent Hisoka at times, and the scent of
blood.
Arc rating 8/10
The zoldyck family arc doesn't really add much to
HxH as a whole apart from the introduction of the
zoldyck family which was cool, I liked how the
family operates and how important each member is.
This arc was really short so there isn't much that I
could talk about, But I always love HxH's choice of
sound at a given time, the sound department nailed
what to use during what scene, and the visuals were
great like always.
not related to zoldyck family but it's a nice detail as
to how nen was shown way before it was even
introduced through Hisoka's cards and gon
concealing his presence without even knowing what
Nen is. (7.5)
Heavens Arena contributes a lot to HxH, and I think it is slightly underrated. Because of the introduction of Nen, The exposition was good and nothing felt too convoluted. It provides an important aspect to HxH's Worldbuilding, as it not only tells is about different places but more so on how the world functions. And we know how much of an important aspect Nen is, and how it can change the way society works(How it divides systems, people, societies etc;)Heavens arena also acts as a tone shift for the coming arc, Yorknew had a very grim and noir tone to it, HxH usually finds itself full of adventure and Heaven's arena helped make the change in tone feel very smooth something good wouldn't even notice. And it also allows for killua and gon's dynamic to breathe. Speaking from a technical standpoint, it has great animation like Gon vs Hisoka with very impactful frames, probably didn't even blink once during that segment.
8/10
And I think Gon and Hisoka's dynamic is pretty great, as their are both contrasting and similar ideas to them, Both Gon and Hisoka have a similar nature and are both driven by anything that interests them. Hisoka being more of the extreme. Gon's goal is that to find his father while hisoka's goal is quite more loose, he's only seeking pleasure through any means. it's very interesting to see how these characters differ and resemble each other.
One of the things that I like about the first couple
episode of yorknew is the tone it establishes, kurapika's point of view is deepened which in turn we know more about the auction system, and the very peculiar introduction of the phantom troupe which is all great with appropriate ost and lighting.
HxH ep 48 makes a nice point on Gon's viewpoint.
He's not bothered by what is right or wrong only what interests him. He opens his mind to everything and it's one of the key points which sets his morals. Which then makes him dangerous and where he begins to act the way he does in Chimera ant
And this is one of the reasons which makes Gon interesting.
there isn't much else that I can say about chrollo than what is already said. many aspects of him have been religiously analyzed, but I still have a sense of appreciation for how togashi crafted his character.
HxH episode 51 is my favorite so far in my rewatch. Everything about is really perfect, animation, ost, and the actual writing itself. The climax of yorknew, A fitting requiem at the loss of a part of himself. Lacrimosa and Riot are
great choices as ost.
I want to highlight how beautiful 1999's take on kurapika is, as i'm nearing the end of yorknew decided to check out some of the 1999 episodes and they've absolutely nailed Kurapika through Imagery.
this all ties in to characterized Kurapika pretty well and make him feel more distinct
They've played extra emphasis on how kurapika's bound to hell. He's pulled down by the very ability he uses on his enemies. And it gives that extra depth to his character because of his wanting to Isolate like I mentioned before, but his isolation is something disrupted by his connections and it gives him the confliction between himself and acts almost as a double persona for himself. this itself makes him interesting and what route he's willing to take. And some of the 1999 scenes definetely help place more focus on his internal thoughts compared to the 2011 where it wasn't executed on this level. Yorknew definetely paints him as tragic with great execution as shown through his wanting to isolate himself. how he's shown to be indecisive about wether he should hold connections with his friends, how he's been consumed by rage And his relation with Chrollo.
I love everything about Yorknew. The character interactions, dialogue, tension, and the story. It manages to convey Kurapika's revenge narrative well, which one can say much above kurapika's character. (His conflict, personality, ideals) He's someone blinded by rage and is so hung up to the idea of revenge he's unable to find any meaning behind his useless rage. Even though he does try and control himself, the path he's willing to take is that of isolation. And Yorknew does display some strong themes(purpose, Vengeance, Existentialism). And while they aren't as impactful, they still contribute to HxH as a whole. And Togashi's character writing does shine here. It's cool to see how everyone's situation starts to interconnect definetely raised the stakes. Chrollo's character was very enigmatic and I definetely do think he does receive characterization, which just means character traits, and thoughts given. And while one may say it's implications, It's pretty evident and makes sense. I find his relation with the spiders very interesting, gives another side to the spiders and chrollo himself. We did get an insight into Chrollo's ideals, his idea of understanding yourself, and expressing yourself. Even excluding The phantom troupe and Kurapika. Characters such as Gon do gain interesting screentime especially when Gon's ideals are made pretty clear. It excels in it's atmosphere and I don't think there is much denying. I do think I love this arc more than before. 9.25
Killua's journey is great and him meeting Gon helped illuminate his world. He's someone who's found a genuine connection for the first time and this friendship is what makes him feel valuable. 
Greed Island was honestly a fun arc on my rewatch. It's understandable why it seems weak because it's sandwiched between two 9+ arcs. But there are
redeeming factors about greed island. I've mentioned this before maybe twice but it's really good in strengthening Gon and Killua's relationship.
Makes their connection feel a lot more organic because of this arc. HxH is great when it comes to
variability, every arc is different to the rest and it offers something new, So an arc like this does work
in HxH. The dodgeball game was pretty intense paired with the ost, and the arc's finale was great. Gon was shown to be selfish throughout the arc and
it keeps on adding to his personality. That of someone who is reckless, selfish, and hypocritical. One may say Genthru wasn't detailed, and lacked any exploration of themes. And while that is true,
Genthru never needed to be someone who had insane characterization. He fits the narrative well and does a good job in opposing Gon, Greed Island
wouldn't need an antagonist who creates an extremely strong presence, and ideology.
I like how the first 5-6 episodes brought change to HxH's world. It was seen more so as vibrant and adventurous, rather than devastating and unforgiving. And it does a good job in showcasing the harsh reality of HxH's world. Chimera ant's show themselves as the dominant species to Humans and show human's suffering but that isn't any different to how us humans consume animals for our survival. And Gon is soon to see the reality of being a Hunter. And it's interesting how much time was spent on Gyro's backstory considering he doesn't make a major appearance any time later on. I don't think Togashi would randomly craft a backstory like this to be forgotten. If HxH was to ever return, he will make an appearance. Because his backstory is pure nihilistic, and one of the causes as to Gyro's wish to cause humanities suffering. It's such a strong backstory
Chimera ant's first 20ish episodes are great . it lays the groundwork for the rest of the arc. Presents many new characters and takes it's time to show the chimera ants. What would have been bad was it rushing to Meruem's birth. Not showing how dangerous chimera ants are, Not explaining some of the events, the Exposition is handled pretty well. And it still is pretty entertaining. Kite's death, Gon's denial, Gyro backstory, Knuckle fight, Meruem's birth, Killua removing illumi's needle are great scenes. And I love one of Meruem's scene which I believe to be quite important. Right after his entrance in the royal palace. He questions why such foolish humans have the right to power. Meruem believe power must fall in the right hand, and he's willing to fix it, Through means that can be considered unjust to humans. ""in the hands of an incompetent power brings nothing but ruin"". Meruem is shown to be someone who realizes the importance of power, there are leaders at this time who have gained their status not because of their just ideals, but because of their connections, An example would be Kim Jong Un.
These HxH eps stretches are amazing (103-108), Komugi and Meruem's dynamic starts taking form. And the entire Gungi sequence is so good in adding subtle changes to Meruem's character while not major changes but great in making smooth transitions. Even though I wouldn't say Meruem is gentle at this point, His questioning of his actions, and komugi's actions help flesh out his thoughts. just supreme character building through Gungi. We see everyone's situation it helps in making the palace invasion all the more real. And one very intense sequence of Knov's infiltration of the Palace. A very genuine scene of knov's breakdown. the voice acting, ost, animation are all perfect. An example of true fear, The royal guards presence is shown to be terrifying because of this. And episode 108 is just brilliant in it's characterization, interactions, and ideas. The royal guards all get the main point of their characterization. Which I'm going to talk about soon. And Pouf's growing hesitation for the King. His slow rise of hatred for Komugi, which would slowly turn into his obsession is all just great. Meruem's empathetic choice for Komugi yet he doesn't understand why he's trying to care for such a fragile creature, his thought process especially when he's questioning makes him a very engaging character. this is Meruem's turning point through previous interactions and now in which he becomes a great character. Chimera starts to go from good to incredible from now on.
Ep 111 is great, nothing but hype and tension. The entire palace invasion was such a well orchestrated strategy, and the sequences were beyond good. (The use of narrator, Morel's situation and Netero's occurring at the same time.) And it took it's time in showing both sides to make the payoff of this scene all the more memorable. The narrator just makes this scene as amazing as it is, because explanation of this depth could not be done through the characters, essentially would have made it awkward, and out of place. And Netero's backstory is particularly interesting for his character which i'd want to make a better opinion of when I finish Meruem vs Netero. it's very engaging and each moment was intensful.
Gon's interaction with Pitou is beyond insane, tor him to act like this. In complete selfishness and hypocrisy, he's narrowed his view only on pitou and decided to ignore everything else, not even consider the situation. Unable to even sympathize for a human who was being healed, For someone who was shown to be so selfish and reckless in the past it's understandable as to why Gon would even act this way. he's been characterized from the beginning to be rigid, and selfish. Seeing him breakdown unable to comprehend what Pitou was even saying. You could feel his pain in his voice, he sees this as totally unfair through his perspective. Why did Kite have to suffer by the same person who is healing another human being. Gon views that as illogical, his entire dialogue in ep 116 is him struggling against himself, he's in a dilemma where he can't even make a decision. Gon is unable to listen to Pitou, because he sees it as no benefit if he does, all he wants is to save kite, that's what he's most interested in. He's so caught up in his acts he views Killua as an interference in his own personal matters, ""This has nothing to do with you"" For him to be so warped in how he sees things he's damaging his relation with Killua, and this episode is the perfect execution of Gon's Character, all helped by the animation, and ost, nothing more you could ask for.
The whole Knuckle vs Youpi fight was fun, Youpi's maturity to acknowledge Knuckle's effort despite
him being much weaker shows his honor and respect as a person which slowly grew over the course of the fight.
Netero is someone who is striving to be grateful through his 10,000 punches in his backstory, essentially seeking enlightenment, where he wishes to awaken, and find the truth of life. It's apparent that he is shrouded with buddhist signs (100 type guanyin bodhisattva, how he looks, and his meditation) In Buddhism reaching Enlightment requires meditation, following moral precepts, understanding wisdom and we see Netero do this, in his backstory.
Despite Netero seeming to be someone who has understood englightment, and empathy. He has used the teachings of Buddhism as a tool to become stronger, in order to continue fighting. He says this during his fight with Meruem. ""To battle an unstoppable adversary"" He's thankful for everything in life that led him to this point. Meaning he's happy that he gets to fight, but that goes against one of the teachings of buddhism, killing any living being is greatly prohibited and negatively affects the karma. which further shows his hypocrisy.
Netero being the person who 'kills' Meruem because of the rose bomb in him (it was his intentions to kill Meruem with the bomb) his death is suddenly filled with malice and grimness, Netero's rebirth according to Karma would be terrible, Netero says to meruem ""if their is a hell i'll see you there"". Netero is someone with a buddhist persona underneath which is hidden of humanities malice.
the use of miniature rose to end the fight was insane, especially calling it a low budget extremely lethal. It was human's deadly creations that would end them
both, not Nen. I think Togashi is trying to make a statement about Humans, the good, much of the bad, and what us humans are capable of, which is far
worse than any other living species.
Meruem's wish to create an unjust world makes sense, without any of the borders humans make, where rich scums exist freely taking more than what they need, and many of the poor suffering from wars and famine. He was originally ordered to become king of this world, and not spare any humans. But through subtle changes over many episodes, his realization with Komugi showed that he believes few humans are worth to be able to keep alive, the human race is allowed to live within a certain area and seeing this through his perspective is crazy, considering how ruthless he should be. Meruem understands the use of power and that it must be used for Just, no one understands the idea of power like Meruem does in HxH.
Meruem slowly learns to understand himself and displays some Humanity or he wouldn't have considered sparing Humans not after seeing how unjust some of them are, for Meruem being born ruthless to slowly treat a fragile person like komugi with care shows his empathy. even during his clash with Netero, he admires Netero's strength, he had unreserved admiration for his enemy, he's not full of hatred for all of humanity. Meruem's thought process, what he says, and his effect on others makes him an amazing character.
Hxh ep 131 is the supreme climax of Gon, The moment where Gon loses it and succumbs to his only option of sacrificing everything, i'll make it clear that Gon's decision is not inconsistent to his character, we've been constantly shown how Gon is willing to sacrifice before. Prime example is when Gon sacrificed his arm against Genthru. His rage against Pitou is a culmination of his anger, guilt, denial, and selfishness. And his decision to sacrifice everything makes his climax, one of the highest i've ever seen. He was willing to sacrifice his life, just so he could kill pitou. Gon was willing to sacrifice everything, never being able to see Killua again, and his life goal, to meet Ging everything that was built up towards his goal shattered in minutes. Gon's situation with pitou is that of denial, anger, confusion. He's in a battle with himself over who to blame. When Gon constantly blamed himself then switched to Pitou then himself, he was unable to accept that Kite died. Gon was so perceived in Kite's death, he didn't hesitate in making his decision. Gon was thrown in a situation where he can't comprehend what to do, and his conflicting emotions, his dilemma to who to blame, his choice to sacrifice everything, makes it the best episode and one of the most important character choices. And apart from the writing of the scene. Everything from the visual direction, animation, and soundtrack was the best. Quite a few new tracks, and some incredible sequences.
Meruem's conclusion might be perfect. Born to rule this world, be the most ruthless in HxH. But for his final moments to pass away like this is insane progression as a character for him, it's not Meruem's change that only makes him great but rather the development he gets since his introduction, ever since the beginning. His commentary on Humans, his characterization from Malicious, and Unforgiving to acquiring Compassion, and humanity through subtle details which help it feel natural, while also presenting themes of power, individuality, and human nature supported by his dynamic with komugi, Netero, and Pouf, I just think it's amazing stuff from Togashi. It's not as if Meruem has forgiven Humanity and realized that he was in the wrong it was never about that. He sees the good, and the bad. He realizes Humans can be terrible far worse than every creature but there's also some light in Humanity, people like Komugi who are fragile and kind, Meruem learns to love and that was the most befitting ending for him.
Meruem himself by the end realizes what's truly important was the time he was spending with Komugi, he was born for his final moments with Komugi. It's one heck of a character journey.
An end to chimera ant. And this is Togashi's Magnum Opus, An arc which no one would have expected when it was first introduced, and an arc which is ambitious in it storytelling, themes, and characters. Where a multitude of characters have their journey explored, it is amazing in shedding light on different perspectives where neither humans or ants get more importance, Chimera is also togashi's commentary on Human nature, Societal issues (conflict, corruption, The use of power) and it all is done so well. No other arc really comes in mind in terms of creativity, and exploration as much as Chimera ant does.
There's still much? want to talk about regarding Chimera and some of it's characters but that's for another time
As much as Chimera ant is about the very disgusting and hypocritical nature of humans, and the nihilistic approach to some of it's moments and what Togashi had to say about the negatives of Soceity (Netero, Gyro, Rose bomb, East gorteau etc;) Togashi sheds much light on what Humans are capable of doing good, and how compassionate humans can be. The ending of Chimera ant says it all.
This is my favorite arc. An easy 10/10
Knuckle, Morel, Knov, Shoot, Ikalgo, and Meleoron were all decent characters in their own right. Certainly nothing insane but nice. Knov's breakdown showing his hypocrisy and trauma was great. A different side was shown of him. Knuckle and Shoot's humiliation during their fight against Youpi, unwilling to leave without payback, Knuckle's choice to repay after shoot's humiliation And Knuckle views ants not so much negatively and some of the other members might have done like Netero. He's willing to accept any ant that has a good heart. and he did make me laugh at occasions.
Morel did get me really hyped at times, and his strategy battles were cool. He was entertaining, and strategic. Chimera probably needed someone like him to make some of the smaller fights better
Human Nature in the royal guards
I saw a comment a while ago regarding the royal guards and it stated the main characterization point of each of the royal guards. Credits to that comment i'll try to find the video. Anyways regarding that comment, I wanted to talk about how that character theme was communicate in Chimera ant for the royal guards and it's link to Human nature. Meruem asks the royal guards their names, Pitou responds saying that the king's feelings are of most importance, she slowly shows empathy, placing important on emotions. Youpi responds saying he's unable to answer the question, he's only dedicating himself to his duty. Pouf, he believes the king has no name, the king shouldn't focus on feelings rather conquest, his loyalty lies towards the idea of a king, not to what Meruem becomes.
Through Chimera ant. When Meruem orders Pitou to take care of Komugi and heal her, tears roll down her face. Komugi is able to emphathize with the king's decision she values the king's emotions the most. And does her best in order to heal Komugi, even during the encounter with Gon in Ep 116 she's not willing to compromise on healing komugi. She slowly starts to show empathy
Youpi originally never showed any signs of Honor or dignity. But his fight with knuckle helped him realize how hard fighting some of the humans were, despite them being considerably weaker. He showed his respect to Knuckle, he had praise for them, almost like a samurai who shows high respect to their opponent.
Yet. But Pouf Never showed positive changes, rather his situation has more focus on it. Pouf shows growing hesitation to the appearance of Komugi, and senses danger for the king. He fears the change that might occur in Meruem. The reason why such emotions and human qualities can even exist in chimera ants is because of the queen consuming them, their genes passed down to the ants.
Upon the palace invasion, One scene of Pouf plays quite a significant role in his character. He starts blaming himself for failing as a royal guard, he believes he's not fit for the king. This shows how strong pouf's resolve was towards the king not meruem, he places the utmost importance in his ideals, Pouf swears Loyalty to his perception of the king. He constantly blames himself but he doesn't want to admit it. You could call Pouf's ideals twisted loyalty. What Pouf doesn't want to admit is his strong hatred for Komugi, Pouf directly sees Komugi as the biggest obstacle for him and the King. In his perception of the king, he believes a king shouldn't spend time with such an inferior creature, not with a lowly human. It is unforgiving, The entire sequence strongly shows Pouf's emotions, and Ideals. Pouf's almost mad fantacism is a result of komugi. He smiled upon knowing that Komugi and Meruem's gungi was disturbed. his Fantacism with the king results in his negativity. He picked up traits such as obsession and hatred from humans.
Pouf's next appearance's result in his extreme obsession, scheming, guilt, despair, and a slight showcase of happiness. Upon arriving with Youpi and recovering Meruem's literally baked body, he starts to let out all tears, his king had died for a brief moment, and we also get one of the weirdest scenes in the show, Pouf's display of feeding himself ends up with him in absurd joy. But that is to be expected from Pouf, he's done something which would save the king, there is no greater joy for Pouf. And Pouf's spiral downfall starts to begin when he schemes a plan to kill Komugi as the king is lost in his memories. Pouf's obsession was once again highlighted he has no other choice other than Killing Komugi to satisfy his ideals. He wished for the king to fulfill his duty of ruling the world. Pouf suddenly becomes very twisted, and the same obsession and resolve which keeps Pouf alive would lead to his inevitable death. Fast forward to the welfin scene. Pouf is ready to die by Meruem's hands, that's how strong his resolve is. Pouf has lost in making Meruem the idealized version, has failed to protect the king from his death. It is nothing but total despair, the poison slowly spreads and Pouf's obsession, fantacism, and twisted loyalty all resulted in despair all because of the barrier being Komugi. In my opinion Pouf is an incredible representation of loyalty, extreme obsession, and despair. His dynamic with meruem, his flaw being obsession, his ideals being perception of the king, all tie in to make an incredible character, it's evident that a lot of focus was placed on him apart from Meruem.
Meruem shows the idea of Determinism and Existentialism. His nature as a chimera ant decides his fate of conquering the world. Determinism means that all events and choices are affected by previous existing causes. Meruem's nature as an ant would be the cause, because he was programmed to rule over all species. An example of Meruem's choices affected by the cause, when Meruem kills many humans caused by his nature as an ant. But he also shows signs of free will, where he goes to kill Komugi but stops. He sees Komugi who is hurt, but acts freely to protect her. It's Meruem's transition from killing humans because of his nature but through interactions with Komugi does he learn about humans. Where Existentialism ties in with Meruem. when he realizes the importance of names he's shown to be existential. He questions his purpose, who he is, and his value. Meruem takes his actions into his own hand, he's constantly battling his own existence, And he continues learning about himself. Meruem is someone who faces determinism and existentialism, where he's originally adapting to his fate, but progresses into finding meaning in his life by himself, And it's that aspect of Meruem which shows Determinism vs Existentialism. 
Election handles the aftermath of Chimera ant perfectly, introduced many new characters while giving a satisfying conclusion to some. The Zodiacs and the election provided a new insight to HxH's world, Gave us Pariston and Ging who are an interesting dynamic and Pariston kept the elections quite entertaining and unpredictable. Pariston is quite the troll, he remains someone with much potential and his nature of challenging himself is fun to watch, and annoying others in order to seek entertainment. Reintroduced Hisoka, who is really important at keeping the stakes high, his impact on the plot is quite significant as he remains unpredictable. Hisoka is a pure hedonist, as he only seeks pleasure. everything from his design, personality and actions scream chaos, and despite not having a backstory still remains very solid, One of the more entertaining HxH characters. Gave Killua his conclusion, his character journey and progression are brilliant. Finding meaning, and self worth is Killua. This but also showing much depth to it, And it's not only because of the change, his flaws as a human of being unable to form connections at the start, dynamic with Gon which goes through much light and dark. A representation of friendship, he becomes much more of a human in chimera and election, he starts to learn kindness, he has a fun personality which I much liked despite what some might say.
Election also reunited Gon and Ging, gave us a farewell to one of shonen's best friendships. gave us one of the most important scenes of the series at the world tree. Ging's philosophy is a perfect encapsulation of the series main message. (using this as an opportunity for a post) And it shows many connections to other character's. Ging is so important to the story of HxH, and Gon's goal is finally achieved. We get to know about the dark continent expanding HxH's world. And provides a heartfelt conclusion to a show full of adventure. If HxH doesn't get an ending. 2011's ending is the one for me. It still manages to end of pretty strong and gives us the final say of what HxH is about. Election also has some very cool shots especially for the last episode just something I liked.",10

                There is nothing quite like HxH when it comes to story-telling. The anime is divided into around 6 arcs, each with their own unique narrative structure and cast of relevant characters. Yet while these arcs might seem disjoint and vastly different in terms of tone and atmosphere, they all connect into one amazing adventure through which characters grow, develop and learn more about the world around them.
While the show finds its strength in the diversity and versatility of its world, it also focused entirely on its characters and the interactions between them; there were many times in the show where an antagonist or side character
                  would feel just as, if not even more, compelling as Gon or Killua. I, and many others, would go so far as to say the show shines through its stellar antagonists. From Hisoka to Chrollo to Meruem himself, each antagonist is something never quite seen before--both within the show itself and among fictional works.
Granted, the show is a shounen and will rely on some shounen tropes. Gon and Killua are exceptionally strong main characters with vast potential; Hisoka enjoys the thrill of fighting and loves fighting strong opponents; certain character developments (no specifics to avoid spoilers) can be attributed to many other similar developments in other works as well. 
However, HxH shines in its execution of these tropes and its subversion of expectations. Gon and Killua might be strong, but they lose more often than they win; the show does an exceptional job in organically having them grow as fighters, but also making sure they don't get the special 'OP protagonist' treatment many other shounen suffer from. Hisoka might just be a guy who likes to fight, but he is portrayed more so as a hedonist and even a parallel to Gon in terms of self-indulgence and selfishess.
And the developments I made mention of might be some that have already been done, but the execution of these developments in HxH distinguishes the series as a gold standard of character development and personification. In the CAA, for example, two characters go through major development that not only fit thematically into the arc, but also juxtapose each other; more over, one of these characters' overall development flows naturally with his character progression throughout the entire series itself.
We've talked about the superb story and characters, but if that's not enough to get you watching this riveting tale then I hope the well-fleshed out power system and amazing production value will. Going off the former point, Nen is perhaps the most consistent, nuanced power system to date. It models aspects of real life, such as:
- jack of all trades, master of none
- risk vs returns (high risk for high returns)
- people being fundamentally different and excelling in different areas
One thing I thought would be a problem is that Nen seems TOO diverse and versatile. Powerups could possibly come up as random, making fights seem contrived because how can two people engage in combat when they have such different skills?
Well, HxH fixes that problem fairly quickly. While characters have certain special abilities, those aren't the only abilities they have. Nen can be used in a myriad of ways, and there are techniques to enhance the body or senses using Nen; as such, someone with a disadvantage in terms of ability can still win if they use Nen effectively and efficiently. Because of this, Nen battles don't resort to randomness for an outcome; it's all about planning, experience and strategy. 
Another thing I feel HxH does well is its focus primarily on story with fights serving as a catalyst for development. It doesn't feel like a linear battle shounen where a fight takes up 10-20 episodes; fights come up when necessary and offer the needed stimulation, but the show holds its own by being a story and character driven tale taking place in dynamic environments. This works wonders because the pace, for the most part, is snappy and allows a viewer to feel engaged.
Finally, the production value of HxH is hands-down the best of any long-running shounen. For a 148 episode series released weekly, Madhouse surpassed all expectations. The quality only goes UP throughout the years, and really never dropped in any single episode. The studio focused more on good direction, choreography and shots instead of just throwing money at the screen. There of course are clear differences between fight quality with, say, the end fights of certain arcs vs more trivial battles within arcs, but even then the latter sorts of fights are still well done and engaging nonetheless.
All in all, I'd have to rate HxH a 10/10 no questions. The story is phenomenal, offering a wide take on themes while presenting everchanging scenarios and environments while still maintaining the core of the story: an adventure tale through which our characters meet other equally-motivated people and have their motivations intertwine and then diverge as both sides change in palpable ways. The characters are incredible and probably the strongest aspect of this show. And the art, sound, animation, basically the entire production value is stellar and still holds a candle to anime coming out in 2018, despite having aired in 2011 onwards. 
Despite being a 10/10 though, there are some nitpicks and issues I had with the show, but they aren't necessarily anything that should hamper you from watching it:
- I liked the first arc but it can be a drag to get through
- The narrator in the CAA can get egregiously invasive, luckily this only happened during a short bout of episodes. And given the CAA is most likely the best anime arc I've seen, tied with the Golden Age in Berserk, I didn't find this a fatal flaw.
- Greed Island's villain is noticeably lacking in quality compared to the antagonists of the other arcs. He's not bad, but for a Hunter villain he's really disappointing.
- The story ends on a somewhat conclusive note but there are obvious plot-lines hanging in the air. Togashi is still writing the manga but due to the hiatus it'll take a decade or two for all these threads to resolve.
Once again, none of these flaws are show-breaking and I think no show is flawless. This is definitely something you should see in your lifetime.",10
"
                One of those gems which are really HARD to find, that is Hunter x Hunter by Yoshihiro Togashi.
The starting point is that of a typical shounen: a boy who wants to meets his father who, instead of taking care of his son, went to a never-ending adventure. But how the story was executed compensated for that clichè. I'm pretty sure that  everyone who didn't watch the 1999 series and still hasn't got baited by this shounen type synopsis like me, immagined how this anime would be very wrong. There's much more to it. 
Unpredictability and development are some of the greatest point of hxh.
                  The fights are always strategy based, so even when a character is very weak, he can still win the battle, even just a part of it (what I mean here is completing the objective but not defeating completely the opponent) . And even when just talking (about the plans or deducing their opponents' move or power), you can feel its intensity which keeps you interested and pushes you to watch another episode. It's also very hard to anticipate how the story would go, it always goes on the other way, near or opposite of what you were thinking. The 'adventure'  and 'bright' theme you thought you'll see here, is not here. Surely, there will be some of those but not the amount you were expecting. The contrast between the dark and bright tone of every arc is enjoyable. 
The only flaw I think there is is the incomplete conclusions of some arc. People are left wondering where this x character go, what is  -insert name here- doing or what happened to this one.  
Madhouse, as we know, always does a great job. Good animations, excellent fighting scenes and in some scenes there are only pictures which highlights the emotion of that particular character be it joy, pleasure or rage, I think it's very fitting and likable. Hisoka and Togari's fight is my favourite. It was very fluid, Hisoka's graceful dodges and moves were well-animated. 
The thing that got particularly criticized is the color palette. Many think that the darker tone of the original is lost. The art which made numerous fans' spines shiver. I think it's just their nostalgia though that they tend to miss what they loved. Personally, I think the colors are just right and the darker color palette are still there or will be there when it's time to use it.
Character designs are fine. Some were changed or were added some details. Others' design really make their persona more interesting, enigmatic or cooler.
Departure! is one of those openings you're gonna hate in the first 5 episodes then will grow on you and in the end it'll be one of your favourites. At least that's the case for me. The only ending I don't like is the first one though I don't particularly hate it because all endings are well made. Ending 2 (Hunting for your Dream) and 5 (Hyori Ittai) are very pleasant to hear
The use of classical music for soundtracks is excellent. They will make you have goosebumps. I honestly don't know how to describe it.
The voice actors/actresses are magnificent, in particular Hisoka's and Killua's. Namikawa Daisuke and Ise Mariya really do an outstanding voice acting on their characters, even with different moods and/or changes of personality.
Knowing it's a shounen, I predicted that this anime would have a vast group of characters; more useless ones with 1 or 2 adjectives needed to describe him/her,  less screen time for each person, and people wouldn't really care if they appear or not. I was mistaken. They're interesting, each has their own story and persona. No one is THAT stupid, if serious, anyone in this series can think of their own strategy, complicated or not. 
Character developments. It's just amazing how the author can write these, especially Killua's and Meruem's. The transition of a literally killing machine into an exceptional and loyal friend: It is just fantastic. 
-1 point because it is unfinished, I'm here like many people wanting it to continue. Though what I really wish for is a conclusion without loose threads.
Everything I've mentioned above is the reason it is 10/10. The 1 point I added, is something you can only understand if you had watched this anime (of course, this only applies to those who loved Hunter x Hunter). Those are the reason why the enjoyment is without a doubt 11/10 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). The only anime I think is par with hxh is FMAB. I definitely recommend Hunter x Hunter to everyone because it  surely is a Masterpiece.",10
"
                First of all, I'm giving this a 1 because it is GROSSLY overrated.
HxH starts off well and is actually an interesting story early on. But the quality in story falls off horribly and enjoyment becomes extremely low (I'd rate it negatively if I could) once the chimera ant arc starts and from there on.
It drags and drags and drags and drags and drags (you get the point) and drags on. I can't enjoy a story like this, especially if it's boring on top of being super long. If you like unnecessarily long plots, then boy are you going to enjoy this. I prefer stories that
                  tell themselves with ease and wrap things up nicely as opposed to making you wait and throwing in a whole bunch of filler. I prefer other high quality stories in 20-40 episodes as opposed to the large quantity of BS that HxH progressively throws at its audience.",1
"
                Decent anime but I didn't find it to be that great. No desire to ever go back and watch it.
Simply put, I think Gon sucks. Just a very low IQ, annoyingly, pseudo altruistic character. Impossible to like because he's just feels so fake and is static/monotone as a person. If he wasn't hanging around Killua most the time, the show would be unwatchable.
With that said, let's discuss the arcs:
- Hunter Exam: Thought it was pretty boring
- Heavens Arena: Definitely interesting, learning how to actually use their skills
- Phantom Troupe/YorkNew City: Could've been good but kind of meh, thought Chrollo was neat
- Greed Island: Really good, best complete arc in the whole show
- Chimera Ant: So awful early on I nearly quit watching the show, it is literally that bad. The arc is crazy long and gradually improves to ""watchable""
- Election: Really nothing special except for Killua's part, which doesn't actually have anything to do with the election haha",6
"
                After Finishing HunterXHunter I've been completely amazed by how great it was. So I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it.
Please note that I haven't read the manga (yet)!
Story: 9
When I was recommended to watch this, my first thought about the story was that it was going to be a happy adventure about friendship and fun. It also seemed like that at the beginning, sure it got a bit dark during the Hunter Exam, but that was to be expected. However, the moment I felt that the story took its darkest turn was when the cast of characters had to complete the final
                  part of the Hunter exam.
After that the story became much more complicated, it enticed me to watch it even more than before. I couldn't help myself from watching it, because every episode had me on the edge of my seat making me more excited for what was to come.
I haven't got much more to say about the story without spoiling anything, but overall I must say that if you're expecting an adventure that teaches you all about morals and fun through lessons the characters go through... you'll only be half right.
Art: 8
The art style is truly incredible if you ask me. The main four characters, Gon, Kurapika, Leorio and Kurapika, look pretty simplistic, however the side characters are all memorable because they all look so diverse and unique. I think this is an interesting parallel to the majority of other anime and manga, as, with most shows, the main characters look super cool and unique, while all the characters they meet look identical and are fairly easy to forget, but I feel as if every character in HunterXHunter is different.
The animation is really beautiful and it goes so smoothly. I've also never seen a point in the show where something looks awkwardly animated or look really ugly (when it's not meant to be).
Sound: 9
HunterXHunter has an amazing O.S.T and it complements the story greatly. Every soundtrack is so in sync with the events and it makes you feel with the characters. The music also gives a bit of personality to characters, as you can clearly predict which character may appear or what might happen just by listening to the song.
The seiyuus for the show play each character incredibly well and the voice of each character sounds exactly like I would imagine.
Character: 9
Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio, to me, have fairly simple personalities, however that can't be said for all the side and supporting characters in the anime. Everyone else in the show feels unique and special, they all have different likes and dislikes, compassions, resolves and in general, personalities. I feel that every character was memorable and each one offers something different.
What I love most about the characters is how realistic their personalities are. Each one is relatable to someone in someway, even the characters that looked super badass and strong would make mistakes that made the feel more human. But, what makes them feel the most human is that not every character got a happy ending and each one had their own end result whether it be good or bad.
Enjoyment: 9
I enjoyed HunterXHunter more than I thought I would. Each arch ended making me want to watch more. I couldn't stop once I started. Almost every scene had me feeling lots of different emotions and the thing I love most about HunterXHunter is the pure friendship between Gon and Killua.
Overall: 10
I find it very hard to be harsh about HunterXHunter because of how great it is. I love this show so much and I would recommend it to anyone.",10

                English Version
I will talk only about the errors of the series .. Arc by Arc
1)Hunter Exam.
Although the beginning paints well and forms the friendship relations of which the main cast will be everything that consists of the examination itself is badly planned, to start all the characters do not seem to have empathic emotions with respect to everything that is happening in the same exam, nobody is unfazed or feels some fear corresponding to death, if I compare it with the whole cast that was raised and the situations in the Chunnin exam in Naruto this part HxH is too short, I could also talk
                  about the end of the exam the hunter is hypocritical in the sense that they had raised this idea ""No matter what happens we will continue with the exam until the end"" but when they reach the tournament part in the end they complement it with ""You can not kill the opponent"" here everything goes relatively ""Good"" but when Killua kills the opponent they send everything to take for ass and approve the others in such a simple way, all the effort of the people who died to love complete the exam they sent him to take for ass for that detail.
2) Tower of Heaven
A whole arc where Killua and Gon go in search of skills, their premise is their problem, because it is basically that, a focused arc only to start making ""Complex"" the fights and make the show ""Deep"", the arc entirely dense, not passable or entertaining, simply dense and tedious, the fights of that arc are worth nothing because Gon and Killua are entirely protected by the plot armor of the moment so you know that they will not lose or die, therefore there is NO RISK, that means ""boring"". The arc is entirely bad
3)York City
Decerebrate action with a protagonist Gary stu to summarize things ... Kurapika skips the rules of the Nen that were established a back arc, you can increase the powers as he wants, He has unlimited access to the whole bar of powers of Nen, does not have any reflection after killing Uvogin because he had previously established that from his point of view everything he does is correct, Togashi fills Kurapika with unlimited weapons and powers after taking all one to create such a complex system of powers ... Shit
4) Greed Island
The tower of heaven made worse; This arc is basically canon filler, you can skip it and it will not change anything, just take care to know that ""Gon and Killua train their powers in a world of video games"" because from then on the villain is the worst of the series in general , the bomber is forced into this arc only to create ""drama and tension"" .. All this arc is the worst shit
5) Quimera ants
Very good the arc entirely, the whole series was prepared for this moment and it is excellent, it has its criticable things as the Asspull of the nuclear bomb of Netero or that eliminated all the development of Meruem giving it ""Amnesia"" only to lengthen the arc still more in a more insufferable way ..
6)The elections
The arc totally shits the consequences of the chimera ants (Revive Gon), the idea of ​​Alukka was not so bad since it had rules but AGAIN togashi loves to fuck his own rules and makes Killua know the only way to get the wishes WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES ... To end the arc with Gon looking for his father in the world tree, Gin tells him the message of the work in general ""That what matters is the trip, not the final destination"" the message would have meaning if Gon had learned something in his trip through the whole series, but you know what? GON NEVER LEARNS ANYTHING, IS THE SAME START TO THE END ... With this proposed you can imply that everything that happened the series is a nonsense that even in its last moments can unite its history with coherence to the message of the work
In conclusion..
The work is anticlimactic, it breaks all its proposed ideas, the protagonist never learns anything, the work is worth only in a single arch of 6 principals, the direction and the music make the series mediocre even if the script entirely becomes bad ..
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version en Español
Hablare únicamente de los errores de la serie.. Arco por arco
1) Arco del examen del cazador.
Si bien el inicio pinta bien y se forman las relaciones de amistad del que será el cast principal todo lo que consiste al examen mismo está mal planteado, para empezar todos los personajes ni parecen tener emociones empáticas con respecto a todo lo que está pasando en el mismo examen, nadie se inmuta o siente algún miedo correspondiente a la muerte, si lo comparo con el cast entero que se planteó y las situaciones en el examen Chunnin en Naruto se queda muy corto esta parte HxH, tambien podría hablar que el final del examen del cazador es hipócrita en el sentido de que ellos habían planteado esta idea “No importa lo que pase seguiremos con el examen hasta el final” pero cuando llegan a la parte del torneo en el final lo complementan con “No se puede matar al oponente” aquí va todo relativamente “Bien” pero cuando Killua mata al oponente mandan todo a tomar por culo y aprueban a los demás de forma tan sencilla, todo el esfuerzo de la gente que murió para querer a completar el examen lo mandaron a tomar por culo por ese detalle.
2) Torre del Cielo
Todo un arco donde Killua y Gon van en busca de conseguir habilidades, su premisa es su problema, porque es básicamente eso, un arco únicamente enfocado solo para empezar hacer “Complejas” las peleas y hacer que el show sea “Profundo”, el arco enteramente es denso, no es pasable ni entretenido, simplemente denso y tedioso, las peleas de ese arco no valen nada la pena por que Gon y Killua están enteramente protegidos por el plot armor del momento asi que sabes que ni van a perder o morir, por lo tanto NO HAY RIESGO, eso significa que “Aburrido”. El arco enteramente es malo
3) York City
Accion descerebrada con un protagonista Gary stu para resumir las cosas… Kurapika se salta las reglas del Nen que se establecieron un arco atrás, se puede aumentar los poderes como él quiera, Tiene acceso ilimitado a toda la barra de poderes de Nen, no tiene alguna reflexión luego de matar a Uvogin porque desde antes se había establecido que desde su punto de vista todo lo que hace es correcto, Togashi llena a Kurapika de armas y poderes ilimitados luego de tardar todo un para crear un sistema tan complejo de poderes... Mierda
4) Greed Island
La torre del cielo hecho peor; Este arco es básicamente relleno canon, te lo puedes saltar y no va a cambiar nada, solo ocupas saber que “Gon y Killua entrenan sus poderes en un mundo de videojuegos” porque de ahí en mas el villano es lo peor de la serie en general, el bombardero esta metido forzadamente en este arco solo para crear “drama y tension”.. Todo este arco es mierda de la peor
5) Hormigas Quimera
Muy bueno el arco enteramente, toda la serie se preparo para este momento y quedo excelente,  tiene sus cosas criticable como el Asspull de la bomba nuclear de Netero o de que eliminaron todo el desarrollo de Meruem dándole “Amnesia” solo para alargar el arco aun mas de forma mas insufrible.. 
6) Las elecciones
El arco caga totalmente las consecuencias de las hormigas quimera (Revivir a Gon), la idea de Alukka no estaba tan mal ya que tenia reglas pero OTRA VEZ togashi le encanta mandar a la mierda sus propias reglas y hace que Killua conozca la única forma de conseguir los deseos SIN CONSECUENCIAS... Para finalizar el arco con Gon buscando a su padre en el árbol mundial, Gin le comenta el mensaje de la obra en general “Que lo que importa es el viaje, no el destino final” el mensaje tendría sentido si Gon hubiera aprendido algo en su viaje por toda la serie ¿Pero saben que? GON NUNCA APRENDE NADA, ES EL MISMO DE INICIO HASTA EL FINAL…Con esto propuesto puedes dar a entender que todo lo que paso la serie es un sin sentido que ni siquiera en sus últimos momentos puede unir su historia con coherencia para el mensaje de la obra
En conclusión..
La obra es anticlimática, rompe todas sus ideas propuestas, el protagonista jamas aprende nada, la obra solo vale la pena en un único arco de 6 principales, la dirección y la música hacen a la serie mediocre aun cuando el guion enteramente llega a ser mala..",5

                This anime is so wildly inconsistent -- the first half was thoroughly enjoyable whereas the second half was unfathomably frustrating to watch.
The first half was fun and exciting. It took some time getting used to the replaced voices (although I couldn’t ever get used to Hisoka’s new voice), and it was irritating to see blood get replaced by flowers and whatnot at the beginning, but these minor issues could easily be forgotten because the series in general was so charming and delightful. The characters had distinct personalities, and the story had momentum as well as consistency. Plus, I enjoyed watching the close bond between Gon
                  and his friends.
The Hunter Exam and Zoldyck Family arc were excellent. The fight scenes were interesting and fairly realistic (such as when Gon’s stubbornness brings him victory over a more physically powerful opponent). And the fact that the characters were acting out of clear motivations (e.g. Gon and Killua out of friendship, Killua’s butlers out of loyalty, etc.) came across as genuine. The Heavens Arena arc was great, although with the introduction of nen, it felt like the action suddenly got much bigger. The Yorknew City and Greed Island arc were okay, though the latter took some time to get used to.
But that Chimera Ant arc was an atrocity, horrendous beyond belief. It was a struggle to finish watching the damn thing. I’ll provide the reasons below:
- It is an understatement to say that the Chimera Ant arc is slow-paced. It’s so mind-numbingly slow that I couldn’t get through an episode without fastforwarding it. In fact, there’s a part where a character says, “It’s only been 5 minutes,” when the actual running time of the event is going over 20 minutes at that point. In the Chimera Ant arc, it takes as many as five episodes to cover a single fight (or at least it feels like it).
- There’s far too much reliance on narration and exposition. In fact, this may be the most problematic aspect of the Chimera Ant arc. Without exaggeration, nearly half of the running time is filled with an old guy pretentiously narrating unnecessary and meaningless information.
- The action just keeps getting disproportionately bigger and bigger. I know that that’s a problem that all shonen animes/mangas share, but it really gets out of hand in the Chimera Ant arc. Throughout the first half of the series, Hisoka was considered one of the world’s most formidable forces. Then come Chimera Ants, who could’ve squashed Hisoka in a second if they wanted to.
- Chimera Ants seriously lack character and charm. Sure, outwardly they’re diverse -- they’re shaped like various animals. But compared to Gon and his friends or the members of the Phantom Troupe, they’re so bland and boring, devoid of personality and not nearly intriguing enough to care about.",6
"
                I really wanted to like HunterXHunter... sooo bad. After being told countless times that this is about as good as it gets I found myself rather dissapointed. There are a LOT of good elements in this show but the manner in which they are presented ruins it for me.
Sound/Art
Overall good. The sound really picks up in the later arcs but i regardless I never disliked any of the scores. The animation is a solid ""good"". It's just about as standard as you can get for this type of show.
Characters
My first major issue with HxH is how it chooses to utilize its characters. From the start
                  of the show you have your focus on Gon, Kurapika, Leorio, Killua, and Hisoka. From the start I felt the only ""real"" Character was Leorio, having shown both ends to the bounds of his character fairly soon. On the other hand I feel like many of the characters in Hxh fall in somewhat of an ""uncanny valley"" between being a real person and just another anime character. Neither one of these is inherently better than the other but I feel like at the start of the show Killua, and moreso Kurapika fall into this category. Both characters seem like the writer wasn't sure how to safely develop their characters. Even in a work of fiction it is still important to have reasonable limits and expectations for characters. I found Killua's strength and backstory very offputting. He is a clear example of when more is less. With Kurapika on the other hand we had to wait till after a timeskip to see his character develop. It seemed like they were trying to develop a cast of really human characters which made me not able to enjoy Gon, since he is about as human as a bowl of pasta. I know during the Chimera Ant Arc this is flipped upside down but I shouldn't have to wait that long to see character development. What makes all of this worse is that Kurapika and Leorio get shafted every other arc and just don't show up.
Despite this Hisoka is an awesome character. This is the one character I feel is written perfectly. The writer does a good job at painting a morally grey atmosphere around this textbook psychopath. Often times he was the only character that made the show worth watching for me.
Story
I still don't know why Gon wants to be a hunter, or even what a hunter really is. It seems like a hunter is just a really powerful nen user who is really good at something, except way too many hunters we see are not at all good people who use this title for its privileges alone. The whole system really doesn't make a lot of sense since there's no inherent demand for hunters as well as no real coordination between hunters.
Gon wanting to meet his father just is not interesting at all. I know he is a naive 12 year old but his dad tells him that he doesn't want to meet Gon. It just seems like a wild goose chase.
The first few arcs are nothing special. The hunter exam is interesting but laughably boring at points. The zoldyk family arc was just wasted time. Heaven's arena was probably the height of my enjoyment of this show. I felt like it was a fun tournament arc that properly introduced the power system into the story, while also adding some much deserved fighting time. The following arcv however is where my interest with this show completely took a 180. The whole YorkNeu plot felt so boring and dragged out and really ended with no conclusion. They spent way too much time focusing on Kurapika's job rather than the conflict with the troupe. I could not care less about any of the characters related to the job. This is also the point in the story where I realized that the writer was just doing whatever the fuck he wanted to do with nen. If you didn't sit down and take notes during Wing's nen lessons you will genuinely be somewhat lost with these explanations. Even though a range of powers is really cool, as a watcher we don't know what can and cant be done which makes it seem like the writer will pull any and everything out of his ass and call it a nen ability. The most I enjoyed this arc was when hisoka switched out the pages and read the fake fortune to the troupe, but ultimately this resulted in nothing. The hisoka chrollo fight was teased so much where it was almost insulting that they couldnt duke it out. I started greed island but ultimately dropped the show",4

                First review on MAL!
Edit: I made this years ago and I was a dumb kid so that's why this sounds so cringe, lmao. Still love HxH to bits though. I'll keep this up as a relic of 14 year old Panda.
Hunter x Hunter 2011 is an anime I never imagined would be as good as it is. At first glance, it seems like a generic shounen, but it is so much more than that. There are layers upon layers in the story that make it so interesting and great. 
Story: 10
The main overall story is fairly simple. A young boy, Gon, sets out to become
                  a Hunter, just like his father. This isn't all Hunter x Hunter has to offer. Through the different arcs, the story takes many twists. At one point, it stops being a shounen and takes a really dark turn (hint: Chimera Ant Arc), and that is a good thing. There is so much meaning in this show, that you won't find in just any series. If you want to see a different and unique shounen, you will not be disappointed with Hunter x Hunter.
Art: 10
The art and animation is just amazing, as expected from Madhouse. They are my favorite anime studio and not only do they do great job of adapting the manga, but they put in time to recreate the scenes beautifully with stunning animation.
Sound: 10
The sound and music is also very well done in this anime. The battle music in particular is very fitting. It is probably the best battle music I have ever heard, and I listen to it while I read Berserk. But the happy and adventurous music is also great, along with the sad and tear-jerking music. It actually really helps with the emotions of the show, and I cried a few times in this show. I listen to the OST a lot, too, along with the one opening, and the several different endings.
Character: 10
The characters in Hunter x Hunter are so well-developed to the point of insanity. You will find likable and entertaining characters, but more than that, you will also care about them. This is one of the strongest points of the series, and it's what makes the story so compelling. 
Enjoyment: 10
Hunter x Hunter 2011 is very entertaining. I was never bored by this show at all. The beginning of it isn't as great as the rest of the show, but it is still entertaining to watch. So even before the really good parts, you aren't bored by all the stuff leading up to it. I won't spoil anything, but I think the Chimera Ant Arc is the best arc by far.
Overall: 10
Overall, Hunter x Hunter 2011 is a masterpiece with amazing quality. It IS my favorite anime, and I think it did everything right that it needed to. The only downside is that it's slow in the beginning, but that didn't really bother me. It was still above average in the early parts of the show, and it is great to rewatch it. I can't believe how much foreshadowing this show actually has. So please, if you actually read this whole review, go watch Hunter x Hunter 2011. I promise you will not regret it.",10
"
                I thought I was missing something. So I watched HxH through the end. That time is gone now. 
It reminds me of a restaurant that has amazing reviews online, smells good when you first walk in, and you're excited to order. The waiter describes their offerings in agonizing details: the farm the vegetables come from, the back story of the butcher that prepared the meat, the history of the ocean where the seafood was sourced, the style of food prep, - while your stomach growls for something/anything to eat. You're curious about certain menu items and you get told that they are all out of
                  them. Rather than let you order after the monologue about the food, the waiter tells you what you'll be eating and walks away quickly. There are several courses which take way too long to arrive and the meager portions of food are concealed amidst inedible decoratives on the plate. Some courses aren't so bad but lack enough seasoning/flavor to justify the wait. Some courses are a completely different flavor profile from the previous. Other courses are much larger than the rest for reasons that don't make much sense while you're attempting to eat it, finding mostly gristle, fat, and filler (looking at you Chimera Ant). One course appears burnt on the outside yet raw on the inside in a misguided attempt at creating something a fine dining experience. At the end of the meal, you're still hungry. You wish you had instead gone with your gut and left much earlier. You start to question if you came to the restaurant on a bad day, if the service was off causing your expectations to be off as well, or if you're just in the lone minority that does not think it lives up to the hype.
That is me when it comes to HxH. I stuck with it because I assumed (by the reviews) it would get better. It did not. In fact, for me it progressively got worse, mired down by its own attempts at creating a vast universe full of banal stories and predictable characters that survive more than they should (or whose appearance makes you question their purpose entirely). I cannot for the life of me understand why so many review it SO highly, continuously. It is both overdeveloped and underdeveloped at the same time. It has action but not enough. It's silly but not silly enough. It's dark but not dark enough.
For me, I should have managed my expectations. There were a lot of parallels to other shounens. The start of the series/Hunter Exam arc is probably the reason I stuck around. Gon gives Naruto/Luffy ""I want to be #1!"", vibes. I liked a handful of characters introductions and it had an old school anime feel with more darkness to it. However when I think about many old school anime that I've rewatched in the past few years, I don't enjoy them now nearly as my expectations for story, art, and action have changed. The art is fine. The action is super ""OK"". Once the chi elements began to come into play, the story shifts into more supernatural/spiritual elements. While not inherently bad, it changes the flavor of the story and it starts to feel forced.    
HxH goes into extensive details and storylines in a way that is continually anticlimactic for me. There is so much exposition at the cost of action and story development. I am meant to care or be interested in storylines, characters, and plots that are underutilized, under/overpowered, and under-developed. What's worse is that some of what could be its best material takes place off-screen (oh Kurapika....).
Many an amine have inspired me to pick up the manga to keep the story going. HxH is the first one that I can say with confidence that will not happen. Although I am curious about the fate of a handful of characters and the resolution of several threads of story, I am not curious enough to subject myself to additional washouts. 
If you're looking to kill A LOT of time, are new to anime, need cosplay ideas, and aren't picky about good storytelling, this may be your thing. Best wishes on that adventure.
**say something nice: There's no romance that I can recall- not my thing. There are gender fluid characters - that's always cool to see. In this, Killua, Leorio, and Canary exist - they deserve(d) better though.",3
"
                Oh boy, where to start with Hunter x Hunter. I guess I'll start off by saying that I'm not entirely experienced in the Shounen genre. At least, not the long running ones. I've seen my fair share of smaller shounen series but the only 'big' shounen shows I've seen are the two Fullmetal Alchemist series and Dragonball Z Kai. I'd say that out of those Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is hands down the best and one of only 3 shows I've awarded 10/10 scores. What I'm saying is, I don't have much of a point of comparison for Hunter x Hunter other than a couple of
                  shows I really like and one I consider perfect, so I am probably not the best person to be writing anything of any kind of depth as I've heard from others that a big reason that Hunter x Hunter is seen as being so good is how it subverts genre conventions generally seen in big shounen shows like Naruto and Bleach. That being said, I still really enjoyed Hunter x Hunter. Not as good as Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, in my humble opinion, but still sits happily at number 2 on that pile of Shounen shows. 
The first thing I'll address are the elements of Hunter x Hunter that, whilst not bad, are certainly what I'd consider the most average things about the show, the visuals and the music. The visuals, whilst not bad by any means, are probably just slightly above average. The general visuals in this show never really rise anything above that. However, I'm willing to let the show slide on this element because out of the 148 episodes, the visual quality never slips and is maintained throughout the rather long run of the show. This itself is actually rather impressive considering there are 2 cour shows with inconsistent animation quality (See episode 4 of Gurren Laggan) so I'm willing to accept above average. The music is catchy and some of the songs are kind of memorable but they use a handful of songs and loops way too much and after 148 episodes it can be a little tired. Again, due to the length of the show, I'm willing to excuse that. It would be crazy to want new songs so often in a show of such length, but still, I noticed it and it bugged me a little.
The characters in this show are plentiful. I'm not sure if this similar in other Shounen but there are probably over 100 characters in total in this show. Granted, most of the characters of contained within certain arcs so it prevents the show from feeling overstuffed. These side characters all vary a lot and in the brief amount of screentime some of them get manage to make themselves memorable. Characters such as Bisky, Kite, Knuckle, Shoot, Palm and a ton of others are all very memorable despite them being in a small amount of episodes in some cases. As for the main characters, this show only really has 2 characters that consistently appear in every arc and, as such, are the main characters of the show. The 2 characters are quite well developed throughout the show, Killua more than Gon. Killua is the only one out of the pair that really goes through an arc, whereas Gon is more or less the same at the end as he is at the beginning in terms of personality. The character development is quite slow and gradual as you might expect with a show bordering on 150 episodes so the development feels very natural. A huge highlight of the show is chemistry between Gon and Killua and watching their relationship grow throughout the show. Gon and Killua don't know each other before the events of the show so you see their relationship start from the beginning on screen and watch it slowly develop throughout the series and by the end you get a genuine sense of how much of a bond the pair have formed during the show. It's probably on the same level, if not a little better than Fullmetal Alchemist in this area, it really is a delight to watch. 
Now, onto the story. This show doesn't have a consistent storyline. Well, it kind of does. Gon trying to locate his father is present in most of the arcs and is sometimes the driving motivation however it is mostly a B plot, always something lingering in the background. So, since the story of this show is broken up into arcs, I shall break this particular section of the review into sections based on the various arcs, in chronological order.
Hunter Exam Arc:
I think this arc is the closest this show really comes to being a traditional shounen show. I also think this arc is one of the best in the show. The amount of variety seen in this arc is great as Gon, Killua, Leorio and Kurapika participate in a series of tests in order to get their Hunter's License. All of these different tests are unique and are a lot of fun to watch. Some of the tests run a little long in terms of episodes but never enough to make you bored. This arc also does a good job of introducing the main cast of the show and establishing the world of the show. This is probably also the lightest the show goes in terms of tone. I'll touch more on this in later arcs but this show is a little all over the place with it's tone. This initial arc sets the show up to be this very light hearted show, which it really isn't. It isn't Madoka-esque but it can be a little jarring.
Zoldyck Family:
This arc is the worst arc in the show, not because it's bad but because it isn't long enough to do anything meaningful and is the only arc where, if it was taken out, I don't think it would impact the show much at all. All it really does is serve to establish Killua's family who are very important in a bunch of the later arcs. Other than that, this arc is probably one of the series lowest points. However, it is still entertaining and not bad by any stretch of the imagination.
Heavens Arena Arc:
This arc is more akin to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. This arc is essentially the first training arc of the show and a lot of the episodes are dedicated to showing this. During this time, the show introduces the concept of Nen, a vague kind of power that is essentially the lynch pin of the rest of the show, and I'd say is quite comparable to Stands. It essentially serves as a means to give characters a bunch of creative and ludicrous fighting powers and I'm really glad they were introduced. Since the show gets more action heavy from here on in, these powers really stop the show from getting boring. As well as the Nen training, this arc also features a lot of fighting in the arena. This part of this arc is also comparable to JoJo as a lot of the fights don't boil down to who is strongest and is mostly about tactics and using abilities to get the upper hand. This makes the fights very entertaining to watch and are the highlights of this arc. 
YorkNew City Arc:
YorkNew City, along with a later arc, is, for me, tied for the best arc in the show. This arc is when the show very abruptly becomes quite dark. Not the darkest it gets, but the show definitely feels very different in tone. This arc introduces the Phantom Troupe, a group briefly mentioned in previous arcs, a group of villains that are some of the best characters in the show. Each of them are very memorable and, despite them doing bad things, are still mostly quite likable. This show is quite good with giving it's villains shades of grey and this really enhances how entertaining the show is and how interesting the characters are. This arc also serves to give major and well needed character development to Kurapika who serves as this arc's main protagonist, and actually has quite little of Gon and Killua and this is the only time this really happens. Nen is used to great effect and, for me, was the visual peak of the show too. I did say earlier that the animation is consistent but I think this arc just looks a tiny bit better than the rest for me. Not exactly sure why.
Greed Island Arc:
Greed Island serves as kind of a calm before the storm in terms of it's placement in the arcs. I takes place right in between the two darkest points in the show and this kind of gives you tonal whiplash both ways going both in and out of the arc. I also find this arc to be the second weakest. It is another training arc but it is kind of dull to watch. This is redeemed slightly by the character of Bisky, who is the first female protagonist in the show and is a delight to watch and very cute. Aside from that, the villain is very 2 dimensional and since it takes place in a video game, it kind of takes the stakes out of it a little big, especially when there is a power in this game that can heal any wound. Again, not terrible or even bad but in comparison to the rest of the show, it is another low point.
Chimera Ant Arc:
This arc is probably the best of the bunch, along with YorkNew City. This is the peak of the show. It is also the longest arc of the show by far, so it has the most time to build up the story and characters of the arc and it really shows. Chimera Ant takes up two thirds of the show and uses it's time well. The story is a slow build and it introduces a lot of characters and almost all of them are well developed. This is by far the darkest the show gets and, without spoilers, can very very shocking and violent. It's not Hellsing Ultimate or anything but it can be quite shocking in contrast to the rest of series. The assault on the palace towards the end is very peak of the show and is just overall fantastic. 
13th Hunter Chairman Election Arc:
The last arc of the show is quite disappointing. Well, half of it anyway. The election itself is boring and I didn't feel any interest in seeing who gets elected. That being said, the story with Killua is very good and entertaining, it's just bogged down by the other half of the arc that I really think wasn't needed. This arc also brings the anime to a close. Due to the manga being on going, there are a lot of loose threads by the end of the show but I think that it wraps up at a good spot and it feels like a natural end to the show. That being said, I do hope the rest of the Manga is adapted when it wraps up in however many years. 
To sum up, I think Hunter x Hunter is a fantastic show, in some places it's downright superb. However, it is quite inconsistent in both tone and the quality of the arcs. None of the arcs are straight up bad, but some of them feel like they could have been better. I'd still recommend this show to just about anyone who isn't put off by the hefty episode count. I think it is a little bit overhyped but is still well worth a watch, just for the Yorknew City and Chimera Ant arcs alone.

                This anime. THIS. ANIME. 
Story: (9) 
The story starts off lighthearted, jovial, and almost with a Pokémon-ish vibe to it. Like Gon, our main character, the story starts off naïve and hopeful. Don't let the beginning fool you. 
An aspect I really enjoyed about the story was how easily and smoothly the show could shift from light to dark and then suddenly back to light. It was almost eerie in a way. Like how babies or dolls sometimes seem scary in all their happy cuteness. 
Going into this show, I wasn't very impressed. Frankly, I was expecting more because of all the praise surrounding it.
                  Overall, however, as I began to watch more, I realized the anime definitely lived up to its praise. Two wonderfully crafted arcs include the Yorknew City Arc and the Chimera Ant Arc (particularly the Chimera Ant Arc; if you've done some research into the show, you've likely heard of it). 
The complexity and sheer masterful writing in the arcs I mentioned were so brilliant, both contrasting and complementing the more training-oriented, lighter arcs which I definitely enjoyed. 
Sound: (9)
I love anime openings and unfortunately, the opening song does not change. Ever (though the animation for the openings do) However, this almost works for the anime in a way, acting almost as an identity associated with the anime (so when you watch the last episode, you'll be feeling nostalgia and likely singing along to the all-too familiar song). 
The soundtrack itself, however, is amazing. I love the Zoldyck family theme, and I adored the endings in particular. They suited the anime well and were composed beautifully. 
There's quite a bit of controversy surrounding this topic, but I'll bring it up anyway: I do believe the character theme soundtracks are better suited to the characters now than in the 1999 version. I adored Killua's theme, which effectively summarized his internal emotions, his upbringing as a puppet of darkness, and his desire to be freed from his family and the burden of being heir to an assassin family. It was melancholic, thought-provoking, and eerie. 
Character: (10)
This is the key factor that resulted in such a high rating for the anime. The sheer complexity of the characters baffle me, especially in regards to Gon and Killua, and their relationship. I can tell you now that if you go into the anime expecting Gon to be a typical shounen hero (i.e. Natsu, Naruto, Luffy), you'll be surprised. I love the multi-dimensions of the main characters and their backstories, their unpredictability and uniqueness. 
The side characters are also memorable and intriguing (the intrigue of the Zoldyck family, the Chimera Ant King and his Royal Guard), and there is intensely well-done development on part of Killua and some others. 
Most importantly, the deconstruction of a typical shounen hero was my favourite part of the main character, Gon. He starts off as a seemingly typical shounen hero, happy, optimistic, and stubborn, with a set goal in mind and a relentless desire to get stronger. When tragedy strikes, however, we get to see a darkness in him that I haven't seen in other shounen heroes before, and it has you questioning who's really the villain or hero of the story. I adored that complexity. There are other aspects that deconstruct typical shounen protagonists as well, such as the instances where Gon's selfishness shows out as a result of his stubbornness and set goals. 
Killua, who I'd classify as the deuteragonist (or even another protagonist), is such a contrast to Gon that it's riveting. Since he's my favourite character, I could talk about his development all day. But I'll save you the long and tedious read for perhaps another time.

                I will go through every single aspect of rating part.
Story: is great! BUT! One big but is way they have represented it in anime. Every single event is over-extended. I'm pretty sure the main story would fit in 64 episodes. Its terrible when you have something interesting going on, but it gets boring super-fast because it takes like 20 episodes to get to the point and then, after 5 minutes, main event ends.
Art: I will take it as animation. Disgusting. Same as story, every single fight last for 45min, while real fight lasts for maybe 15-20 seconds. Its frustrating to have every single fighting move
                  followed up by 10 minutes of backstory, thinking and whatever.
Sound: While OST in general was decent, listening to 2-3 same songs over 148 episodes gets annoying so fast.
Characters: Maybe best part of the anime are characters. I can't recall a single character being ""out of the character"", having unreal develpoment or being annoying in general. Every major character have its own flaws and positive sides, and by the end of the anime, I still had sympathy for most of them.
Enjoyment: Narrator is most annoying thing I've ever heard in my life. He is explaining every single detail that is on screen. Like, hello, I have eyes too! Other things, as said in Story and animation part, it is EXTREMELY OVER-EXTENDED! If they've cut-off all unimportant things, flashbacks, delaying events, it would be probably best anime ever. But like this, its extremely boring. One example: Probably best event in the anime was about to happen. End of that episode, everyone is prepared to go on, clash is about to happen! THIRTY-FIVE EPISODES LATER: IT STILL HASN'T EVEN STARTED. Enough...
Overall: 5. Praise for characters, story was meant to be good, but marketing did the thing with delaying everything. In my opinion, this is most OVERRATED anime of all times, and if you, dear reader come across this review, for the love of God, skip watching Hunter x Hunter!",5
"
                So I'm a huge fan of short anime. I prefer to watch 12 or 24 episode seasons, as I usually find that longer stories feel like they drag on for me. Which is why I've never watched most big shonen, like Naruto, Bleach, or One Piece.
But my best friend adores this series like nothing I've ever seen. So naturally they wanted me to watch it and I obliged, with the expected response being that I'd go ""It was fun but eh"" 
I was wrong. 
With the way it starts I was sure I'd be right, a young boy goes on an adverture to fulfill his
                  dream and find his dad! Ookay, so it's a JRPG plotline. Lame.
But Gon is never annoying. He's never a bad character. I've often heard the term 'Green Naruto' and that's the literal opposite of the truth. 
But that's only Gon. That's only 1 of 4 main characters. The dynamic between the 4 main characters is where the anime shines in the beginning. 
I will not spoil in this review but I will say that this anime's story is very much like my wallet at an anime convention. At first it's happy and carefree, unknowing of the harsh despair that's ready to follow. Shit hits the fan. Seriously.
My biggest problem is that the anime, as it is now, ends a little weirdly. It's obvious there's much, much more to come, but as the manga's creator has issues slowing down the manga's output, we haven't seen the continuation of the anime itself either. Hopefully yet.",10
"
                This review only applies for the first 11 episodes of the series, it does not constitute for the overall experience of the anime itself and it will be comprised of what I liked/disliked about the anime and the reason I have had dropped it for.
One of the aspects that most people agree that Hunter x Hunter does have, is the element of analysis and strategy through the action and confrontations in the series. And it does try to do this at every turn. 
However, just because it tries, it doesn't mean it is good at it. I'll give you two examples of how I see
                  these attempts as botches, one being from episode 2, and one from around episode 10-11. If you want to avoid spoilers, although I will describe these in manners that merely describe the confrontations themselves, without real plot specifics, skip this paragraph. If you just want to get the Episode 2 example, because you see a spoiler from episode 10 as being too late in the series, then skip after I've delivered that one. So, in episode 2, there's a test the cast of characters come across, where you have to choose to save either a or b, with the choices being a person you're close to. Like mother and lover, brother and sister etc. You have 5 seconds. The test is obviously subjective. There is clearly no correct answer. How do you win the test? Pick no answer. Now my problem isn't the test itself, but the contradicting explanations for the test. The test evaluates whether or not you're capable of making a decision when there are high personal stakes. Then how is not making a choice the right answer, or at the very least, why is picking an answer clearly wrong? If you think about it, merely making an active choice in those 5 seconds, should be correct, regardless of reasoning. It just makes no sense, because a person that makes no choice because they were still thinking passes, and a person that made a choice, is failed because they made a choice. It is a poorly made exam to showcase the impressionable third choice between A and B, at its barebones. Choosing nothing or both, when presented with two options, is one of the simplest techniques of misdirection in strategy and writing, because it plays with your preset expectations. But in this situation there's not even a plausible setup to the situation, as the explanation makes no sense for the given purpose of the test, because stalling a decision, could result in saving neither. Now I will talk about episode 10/11's botch. So there is this fight to the death between two contestants and one of them leaves the other unconcious. However the participant refuses to kill them in order to secure the match. They end up agreeing the match is not over until the enemy becomes concious, so they can surrender. Eventually hours pass and they want to check the body, but the enemy team does not allow them, which is incredibly stupid. They should have no say in the matter if they simply send the participant of the test to simply check the pulse, but instead of that, they now start a betting game, where they bet their remaining time, on whether or not the guy is concious or unconcious. Now I also have a problem with this game. The reason is the following. One of the people first bets on option a, then wagers on option b. Lets say you played poker. You put in like 20 dollars. Then more cards were revealed. And then you changed your bet, and only bet 1 dollar. Does that sound like a rigged game? Yes. Because every betting game and game of chance is designed in a manner through which you commit to your answer. If you had the option to change your bet as you saw fit, you could always back down. The moment you change your bet is the moment you admit you were wrong. This is literally what had happened: You: I bet 20 dollars that this turtle is red. Other guy: Btw I can prove this is the right answer. You: Oh ok, then I'll bet all my income on the opposite answer. This just screams of a lack of understanding of the way bets are supposed to work, which simply does turn me off from the entire thing. It isn't necesarily wrong on the basis of the rules given, but it is an impractical betting game, which the participant should've objected against.
And these two instances aren't merely the only ones where I found problems in the confrontations, but are merely just examples. Hunter x Hunter's attempt at seeming strategic simply doesn't work with me, since it simply has flaws every time in the design of the confrontations themselves. At pretty much every point, when the show's goal isn't to just show character traits, it has flaws in the portrayal of the challenges, or some minor things that I dislike that are merely matters of the design itself, like the monster designs or the subjectivity of the exams, and the fact that some of them don't have clearly defined rules, or not really enforced rules, or are simply left to choice of the examiner, to the point the examiner could fail or let everyone pass on a whim. The focus on explaining how everything was planned out makes the action last only a few minutes at best, with the explanation lasting several more. So in terms of raw action, there isn't nowhere near as much as the explanation of every single move done up to that point. The action of the series is simply too short in length for my liking, and the actual strategizing and analysis of actions in the series is goofy/obvious at best or moronic at the worst.
That for me,  breaks the show, since I can't watch an action shounen when every type of confrontation I see is either not particularly impressive, with some guy just making a simple movement and everyone else dying or just a brainfart underwhelming everything they try to do. The story and the characters aren't something particularly stellar at the moment. The protagonist is a generic shounen protag in terms of personality, with him not being really smart, really energetic and looking out for his friends, while also having a lot of determination. The side characters are Killua, who was built to be cool, and as of yet, I've only gotten a glimpse at his backstory. He is meant to be an edgy cool character, who could kill at any time with ease. Another character is Leorio, who is meant to be the goof of the group and an average joe. And the last character is Kurapika who I didn't like the portrayal of. You see, he is the tragic ""I want revenge"" character but his portrayal was quite ridiculous from the start. Someone threatens to eliminate every last trace of his family at one point, and that is supposed to the introduction to how much this influences him. Kurapika reacts pretty much like this ""Please take that, I swear, please take it back. Take it back? I'm gonna allow you to take it once more back. Okay, take it back now. Please???"" Which I found really ridiculous, because this is a person that is on a revenge quest, that can't even muster enough rage to shut someone up directly insulting his lineage. The second time the same subject comes to mind he gets angry he knocks a person out, because they wore the same tattoo as the people that killed his family do, after... well... being provoked by him, and taunting him... and the goal of the fight being to beat them... He did absolutely nothing someone in his situation, revenge or no revenge, wouldn't have done. He defeated his opponent. So I'm not sure exactly what type of vengeful character he's supposed to be. Because his actions while angry don't really show that he's angry. At best it shows restraint. In the first interaction he played it so straight with so little anger that I thought he was legit bullshitting everyone about his family being dead. Which isn't particularly good thing for this type of character unless it takes 180 degree turn. And the story's goal so far is simply to present the characters and what hunters are. And the fact that it seems really rushed at times
But the unfortunate thing is, that any direction Hunter x Hunter might take with its story and characters, if the action is still like this, I don't want to continue it. Simply seeing something pass off simple actions as smart, and then not really having enough introspection to explain itself, is not entertaining. I won't claim it is entirely horrible, since I am familiar with Togashi's writing style, and I did think that the character trait establishing was done decently in the show, excepting Kurapika. I am familiar enough with it to understand that this arc is just mere setting establishment. And I know he is capable of writing interesting stuff, as well as interesting fights. But in this series, I notice that the action takes a weird turn, where it tries to be innovative by explaining the course of action, with the course of action not really being well thought out most of the time. The only way I'd be able to enjoy Hunter x Hunter is if I didn't attempt to understand what I am watching and I took everything they said at face value, the one set by the anime, and had like no reference points. 
But does this mean that I see no value in Hunter x Hunter? Why would I deem it as mediocre if I simply dislike it so much. It's simply because at least it attempts to present some situations that are meant to be thought provoking. Yes, they are simple and oversold, but the confrontations at least try to be something different and present what they want to mean. The overall animation of the show may not be of a style that I particularly like since it sometimes is cartoonishly colorful, but it is consistent and mostly preserving any key details needed each episode. The anime does often a good job of presenting new character traits and capabilties through the medium of the challenges that are posed each episode. And in some cases, it is self aware that the challenges may be poorly planned, solely on the basis that there are challenges set upon by an examiner where the test is impossible to pass, as they have to say yes to them passing the test. So the tests could occasionally be poorly handled, and that being an onscreen reason. So you could occasionally shift the blame on the examiner and the participants themselves. I wish that it possessed that level of self awareness all the times and called out any possible bullshit, but it doesn't. In other words, I can see that it tries to be something interesting and acknowledge in some ways that it can be flawed. But it simply doesn't interest me, because what it tries to execute needs to be better thought through. I could excuse this if the driving force of the series would've been something different, but the way the action is handled, does not entertain me and only makes me question it. Ultimately I can only recommend Hunter x Hunter as one thing, and that if you're curious about watching an action series that is introspective about its course of action. I didn't particularly find that it excels in what it attempts to do, but it is what it consistently keeps on creating. It won't have constant action scenes, but a lot of the thoughts behind the actions, and a lot of explanations on why the things that are done are actually being done. If you're interested in a series that tries to constantly present why someone in a shounen chooses a specific action in a confrontation, you will be 100% aware in Hunter x Hunter. But don't expect too much depth out of the confrontations themselves. It may be praised for those, but if you spend some time to dwell on them, you can probably find one or two holes yourself. Accept that it is a simple shounen that tries to diversify the formula that showcasing how some characters think about the situations they are in.",5

                Hunter X Hunter is unique. It brings the enjoyment of a series like Naruto but at the same time brings the quality of a series like Berserk. 
Art- The animation is absolutely exquisite. This is the only long running series that I have seen in which the studio is able to maintain high-quality art. We often see in series such as Bleach, One Piece, and Naruto that the animation quality is all over the place, sometimes being fantastic and at other moments being utter shit :) Hunter x Hunter's fictional world immediately captivates you with its beauty and mystery. And the art does nothing but
                  enhance this experience. 
Sound- The soundtrack carries a certain depth that very few anime have. I many of the modern anime I have noticed that there ost's are very simplistic and play the same songs over and over. Fortunately Hunter x Hunter doesn't rely on one song for people to rave about but rather a composition of many. In fact, even though I have already completed the series, often I will go on youtube and re-listen to a part of the soundtrack. 
Character- Hunter x Hunter is not about just one character but many. The main characters don't have a monopoly over the screen as is common in many anime, rather each episode gives you time to understand the diverse array of personalities within the series. The two main characters Gon and Killua are portrayed in a manner that makes the viewer want to watch them progress as human beings, and the same goes for the rest of the characters.
Enjoyment- In terms of enjoyment Hunter x Hunter is in a very select class of the best. It has that shonen quality that makes you want to watch more and more. But the difference is that many shonen contain many flaws,whereas this one has very little. 
Overall- 10/10 
For me Hunter x Hunter IS the greatest anime of all time. It's art, sound, characters, and enjoyment are all in a class of its own. If you have concerns about the initial childish nature of the series let me address them with a quick story. Recently I convinced my brother to watch Hunter x Hunter, after viewing the first episode he deemed it as childlike. I simply told him that it wasn't what he thought. The innocent manner in which the first episodes are composed is just a starting point to develop the characters. He hesitated to continue the show at first but decided to watch it. He finished the whole series within a month and praised it for its balance of light and dark themes. In conclusion, it is likely that you will enjoy this series. So please just watch it :)",10

                Hunter X Hunter is definitely an anime that will be heard a lot when someone first gets into anime. Should you watch it? That's up to you to decide. I can only provide my opinion on the anime, nothing more, nothing less. What's my opinion? Hunter X Hunter is an overhyped chore of an anime to get through. I mean, at times, I literally felt dread starting an episode. Almost like it was homework or something. The sad thing is, Hunter X Hunter is quite enjoyable in the beginning. Comical and interesting characters. Intriguing and dangerous obstacles. It all seems like it can't go wrong.
                  Oh but it does (for me at least). The story slowly evolves into a slow, boring, and confusing mess. ""Oh something happened to this character? Why should I care? Oh, I should care because they were shown in the first or second season?"". I understand a lot of people love this show, but I personally can't see why? Later in the anime, it feels like the show should be called ""Narrator X Narrator"". I mean, the narrator just won't stop explaining people's powers, moods, and the overall state of the entire universe. All jokes aside, the most lovable characters suddenly disappear in the beginning to middle of the show, only to appear in the very end. Hunter X Hunter had very few enjoyable moments to call it one of my favorites. The pacing is abhorrent in later stages of this anime. Not even in my top ten for what it's worth. Overall, it just wasn't my cup of tea. You might really love it, or really hate it. No way of knowing until you press that play button.",6

                Hunter x Hunter (2011), based on the manga ""Hunter x Hunter"" by Togashi is a 148 episode long anime, not rarely is said to be the greatest shounen of all time. It's widely popular, and with its lovable cast it became a must watch for anyone who's getting into anime. So, how does it hold up?
First things first, Hunter x Hunter is quite misleading. With its lighthearted soundtrack, joyful atmosphere and a male lead that might as well be radiating hapiness, the first arc leads you to believe that this show is the furthest thing from horrific you could think of. And it keeps up
                  that spirit for quite some time, but as you dive deeper and deeper into the show, the arcs grow increasingly moody. Deaths are no longer trivialised, and you can actually feel the main cast being threatened. Eventually you will reach the famous ""Chimera Ant"" arc, and you'll come to realise that none of that joyful atmosphere the show had gathered at the start will be left. The show has transcended into a dark fantasy, with chance of death ever looming.
All of this aids in the establishment of this show's strongest part: its cast. Killua and Gon make two fantastic lead characters, and I find it hard to believe anyone wouldn't appreciate these two. Gon's self righteous, yet goodhearted nature and Killua's familial roots clash perfectly. They're instruments, used to show the viewers how much these two grow together and what kind of bond they have. Other cast members  include Kurapika, Leorio and Hisoka: All of which are likable, established and interesting characters. Hisoka in particular with him being Gon's mentor alongside the anime's villain.
Take everything I’ve said above and coat it in fantastic production vialues. That’s what Hunter x Hunter is really like at its peak. While the art isn't always top tier, it seems to do its jobs and during the necessary action sequences, the animators went to extra lengths to add that bit of finesse. Madhouse did a fantastic job adapting this, and I have nothing but praise for them. 
So far I'm full of praise, but I did actually have some major issues with this show. With the chimera ant arc taking up 60 episodes, which is more than a third of the total runtime, I feel obliged to comment on it. Regardless of whether you love or hate it, it's hard to deny the impact this arc alone had on the series. The way I see it, the chimera ant arc was necessary for the show to distinguish itself from other shounen, but I found it to be very inconsistent. Oftentimes I found myself staring at the screen impatiently while they gave screentime to another character I did not care about. All to find out they were going to do this for 5 more episodes before finally giving the two characters I wanted to see a minute of development.
Don't get me wrong, this show's highest peaks all happen in the Chimera Ant arc and they are amazing. There are episodes here that will go down as some of the best anime episodes of all time, but this arc managed to bore me more than once. When all is said and done, those boring episodes are just as much part of the show as those amazing ones are. In the end, the Chimera Ant arc is not my favourite part of the show and at times reminded me of Overlord season 2 with the way it treated its viewers.
In conclusion, Hunter x Hunter is a quality show. It has a cast with two of my favourite leads of all time, and is fantastic at slowly making the show more and more unnerving with horrific scenery, which is highlighted by the show's high quality art and sound. However, the Chimera Ant arc at times bored me unlike any other arc in this show and I can't dismiss that. 
Final verdict: 7.5/10 with its main selling points being characters and sound.",8

                Just finished watching this and all I gotta say is that this is the best anime that I’ve ever seen so far in my anime/manga journey. Want a good exam arc? This is the show. Want an actual good isekai arc in Greed Island? This is the show. Want the best arc in any shonen in the Chimera Ant Arc? This is the show. I honestly don’t have enough words to praise this show. What separates this show from most shonens are the character driven arcs and the trials and tribulations that stem from the characters motives. Along with great motives, the characters are just
                  likeable. Gon, Killua, Kurapika, Meruem, Hisoka etc. are all eccentric and fascinating characters that all have their flaws that make them unique but grow as well as the series progresses. The writing in this show is also amazing due to the character progression as well. The flaws that each character has makes them stronger characters and them overcoming their flaws in each arc is what makes this show so great. Besides that, the animation is solid throughout. This series in my opinion has some of greatest fight scenes in a shonen because it’s not all just about people punching people. Smart strategies are just in pretty much every fight, making them all entertaining. Madhouse did a great job animating these fight scenes. Overall, I’m pretty empty knowing I can’t watch this show for the first time again. This show is a 10/10 no questions asked. Now if you excuse me, I have to catch up on the manga...",10
"
                I cannot get over how perfect this show is.  I started watching it, because I had read everywhere that it is one of the best things that has graced this planet.  I jumped into the show with really high expectations and was expecting a decent anime with too much over-hype.  BOY WAS I WRONG!
When you first start watching this show, it will seem sort of childish, or your typical Shounen animu.  However, you will begin to receive little hints throughout the series that there is more than what meets the eye.  This is definitely NOT a children's show.  There
                  are many subtle twists that nudge you along the way and then suddenly when you begin the Chimera Ant Arc from episodes 76-136, the show starts turning all of those twists and nudges into jabs and the show hits you like a Mack truck.
I am not saying that the show is not good until episodes 76-136, I'm just saying that that is the arc that no one can shut up about.  The entire series is beautiful and is very very well paced with only 2 episodes of filler.  The SUB voice acting is stunning and the art style stays consistent and is gorgeous throughout.
Overall, I would not only recommend this anime, but I would go so far to say that it is a show that everyone should watch at least once before they die.",10

                Truthfully, Hunter x Hunter changed my life. It leaves a lasting impression on those who take on the commitment. The time put into watching this series is 100% not time wasted. I learned a lot about friendship, power, responsibility, and myself. I learned about perseverance and consequence. I learned about patience and judgement (as it takes a little patience and reservation of judgement to really get started/past the first three episodes with this show). I learned a lot about the grey areas in life and how to not be so hard on other and myself when faced with those challenges. I learned a lot about
                  being an adult from watching this show. I didn't want to write this review about the series itself, but instead what I got from the series. To me, that speaks louder than any in-depth review I could give. I hope this is somehow helpful to someone.",10

                HUNTER X HUNTER: Why Gon’s character is so appealing and How Fathers Are a Factor.
[MINOR SPOILERS] APPLY
This is an analysis comparing like shounen to Hunter x Hunter and its main protagonist to the protagonists of these like shounen. I will not include One Piece or Bleach in this article since my knowledge of both is limited.
You know it: dads with unknown whereabouts, the popular training/arena arcs, deus ex machinas, main characters with exponential power growth, etcetera.
Shows like Fairy Tail and Naruto among others share these common traits. However, one show’s got them beat. That’s Hunter X Hunter.
For those of you who have not seen it,
                  Hunter X Hunter is about a boy named Gon who wants to become a Hunter, like his father, who he is obsessively interested in but has never met. A Hunter is a person who conducts different kinds of research, to put it vaguely. Each Hunter has different goals. Some search for rare treasures, to put an end to rare curses, and more. They explore and affront the mysterious which in the day to day most are ignorant of. Gon is one of these Hunters. His goal is to search for his dad.
And this doesn’t sound uncommon, right? There’s always shrouds of mystery over the fathers of shounen protagonists. There are the dragons in Fairy Tail, the Fourth Hokage in Naruto, and I’ve never watched past episode 20 of Dragon Ball, but who is Goku’s dad anyway? Regardless, there is a mystery surrounding these protagonists that is seemingly necessary for the development of our heroes. To know their background is to know them in a richer, more intimate way. These shows constantly broach the question, until it answers it, “how did dad pave the path for [insert shounen character].” This question focuses on the path, but really, what occurs in regard to this question is a development which makes the character’s further development dependent on finding dad. This means dad becomes the primary means for anything to happen with our character. So our focus is now filtered through dad. Why? Because it’s all thanks to dad:
Dad made me a dragon slayer. Dad put the Nine-Tails inside me. That’s why I’m special. That’s why I have to find him. I need to learn more. What happened to dad? I need to find out.
Now the matter on our hands concerns how dad affects [insert shounen character’s] existence. The original question then unconsciously becomes, “how has dad shaped [insert shounen character] by paving the path for him?” instead of focusing on the path itself.
Gon defies the necessitation for his development and identity to filter through his dad. In order to address why this is so, we first must address Gon’s development.
He has a strong sniffer. He has a lot of patience when it comes to fishing, fishing being a form of hunting many Hunters partake in, I should mention. These qualities come in handy. So Gon is special in his own way. He has two good traits to go on. Everyone has a good trait or two. But, unlike other shounen protagonists, he’s NOT MADE special. He’s not from a different planet with Super Man like strengths. He possesses no powers at the onset of his journey like Natsu. He doesn’t have the Nine-Tails in him like Naruto. Gon is weak.
Gon starts out as literally a regular boy. His weapon in the first fifth of the series is a fishing rod for Christ’s sake. So, he’s a regular boy by all means. Like shounen protagonists, Gon is kinda dumb with a heart of gold, and eventually becomes super powerful. However, Gon’s ability to become powerful is the result of the environment he grew up in rather than what he was imbued with by his father. He grew up close to wilderness. Gon’s from the boonies. He loves animals and nature. He’s ignorant like a country boy who didn’t grow up in the city, but unlike a city dweller, he’s resourceful. And that’s how he is throughout the show. Yes, like Naruto and young Goku, much of how he reacts to situations is very much dictated by his innocent and unprepared personality, but unlike them his only card against obstacles is his expansive repertory of experience from living off the land. Again, he has no special power or background. He’s just a regular kid. It’s not until later on that he discovers and begins learning how to use Nen: one’s life aura which can be used in combat, healing, or anything else normal to bizzarre you can imagine.
For me to further reach those who remain skeptical about Gon being unique, even more special than other shounen protagonists, Ging should be addressed now.
Now, Gon nor the show itself may seem unique due to the “like father like son” dynamic of shounen obviously being part of Hunter X Hunter, nor does he seem initially all that different from his father. Gon grew up in the same environment as his Ging. One could say the same for Naruto, but Gon unlike him has the choice to become a Hunter, regardless of the circumstance, without pre-destiny. Naruto doesn’t have a choice as to whether he will become a shinobi, and I don’t know what I should say about Goku. I suppose he has a choice too. However, considering what we know about Dragon Ball, more specifically Dragon Ball Z, we know that Goku is much needed to combat the threats that face him and the world. This is untrue of Gon. Gon is definitely not a needed character throughout Hunter X Hunter. Sure, he’s a vital component in defeating one of the king’s three royal guard during the Chimera Ant Arc, but it’s easy enough to image someone else who is much stronger taking on that role. He could have simply chosen to not become a Hunter, but we wouldn’t have the same show. So, it comes down to choice. Gon always has choices. His father merely gave him one path he could optionally follow: not one chosen by destiny.
And while it’s true that Hunter X Hunter hasn't finished serializing, it is with doubtful prescience one could foresee Gon becoming the most powerful Nen user to the point he’s the only one capable of tackling obstacles. After all, that was the point of the Chimera Ant Arc. Hunter Chairman Netero, the strongest human Nen user, couldn’t even defeat the primary foe with his skills alone. No one’s so powerful nothing can be done by others.
Gon becomes extremely powerful, but it is with determination and intent, not a Nine-Tails beast inside him or having the genetic superiority of some space monkey. And, we come to find out in the show, many Nen users have some condition which must be met in order to use their powers. It’s not necessarily that a power has a separate counter-balance like kryptonite; rather, the user affects himself through his own use of power. If he doesn’t meet his own condition to use it, or even if he meets a certain condition to exchange with something of equal value, the ensuing danger or consequence is his alone to take on. We see this when Gon changes (which I will intentionally say so vaguely), and when Netero uses Zero hand.
What we know about Togashi, the creator of Hunter X Hunter, is that he really only utilizes the teamwork dynamic. Nothing can ever be accomplished without a buddy, which is what makes Gon so special. Naruto may also rely on his team, but Shippuuden comes to a point where he’s so powerful, everyone else would just get in the way, besides Sasuke. Even then, the two don’t need each other in combat. Each is more than capable of handling a problem himself. What makes Gon interesting is he needs his best friend, Killua, as a foil, otherwise, without the balance of character, he might just become annoying over time as Naruto does which many fans complain about.
Sasuke acts as a foil to Naruto, sure, but like I said, Naruto can be imagined off on his own without Sasuke. Gon, on the other hand, needs Killua to save his ass more than a handful of times, whether that’s in a physical fight, mental breakdown or anything other. Both are the shoulder the other leans upon. Hunter X Hunter would become boring without this dynamic. I’ll stress again: Naruto and Goku can handle pretty much everything themselves come a certain point. This is absolutely, indubitably untrue for Gon. When he’s not with Killua, he nearly dies every time, and in the end, he would just become a boring character.
Like his shounen protagonist peers, he has a propensity for selfishness and heroicism when it comes to saving others, which reflects a certain careless optimism paired with a desire to win that costs him dearly in many parts of the series, especially the final fifth of the show. Obviously, most times, it is when Killua is not with him.
This becomes especially apparent during one part of the Chimera Ant Arc. Gon admits how “frustrating weakness [is]”. Even then, Gon continues to struggle through this mentality which gets him nearly killed. He may have the spirit of Naruto and Natsu, but neither character comes nearly as close to death as Gon. For both, positive attitudes are seldom met by dire consequences which cannot be countered and overcome. Nor do we ever see Naruto and Natsu address any overwhelming feelings of defeat. They’re always the “yes-man” backbone of hope. Gon is too, in a way, but he can’t always be right about the outcome of things. No one can. This is what Naruto and Fairy Tail fail to realize. Once Gon realizes he’s wrong about a tomorrow he thinks he’ll see, his ego breaks down and he has no idea what to do. This is when he becomes irredeemably reckless, and accepts death. This is when the show conveys that one’s own actions come at a high price: something else Naruto nor Fairy Tail seem quite able to capture, for the premise of both shows rests upon the principle there will always be a better tomorrow, or a certain future, something untrue for Hunter X Hunter come the Chimera Ant Arc.
Another thing that makes Gon especially interesting is that there is more than one side to him. As mentioned, he becomes a reckless character, and this brings out all kinds of dark and previously untapped thoughts that make his delve into the foray that much more enticing and gut-wrenching. He says things and acts in a certain way that, hitherto, has been completely unexpected. Throughout the first three-fifths of the show, you get to know him, and you think you know him, but then he encounters irredeemable loss and an irrepressible anger that he manifests into the climax of the show which serves as an antithesis to the Gon we meet at the beginning on Whale Island and the Gon we see during the height of his power while he’s at his lowest low mentally, emotionally and morally.
It’s the first time he’s frighteningly serious, his optimism all but diminished. This is what is expected, naturally, of shounen characters like Naruto. They maintain the same mental space throughout their encounters when everyone else loses it. Gon loses it while his resolve and will become stronger. This is a concept very unique to a shounen protagonist. I believe Togashi is the first to separate the will and resolve from the unperturbed state of the ego. Gon is definitely more than perturbed. This leaves the audience wondering on what scale Gon could achieve such a spectacle of recklessness. We are granted that spectacle. You’ll have to watch the show to find out if you haven’t experienced this yourself.
Unlike other shounen shows, everything in Hunter X Hunter (2011) up to the end of the Chimera Ant Arc is Gon’s training arc. This is all in preparation to find his father. It’s unclear whether Ging has plans for Gon, but more than likely, Gon will choose his own path even after finding his own father. I speak from the point the show ends, not the Dark Continent nor successive arcs which continue after in the manga. Even if he does team up with his old man for a while, it’s unlikely he’ll stick around long. Gon will want to forge his own path. Gon’s purpose was after all just to meet Ging. It’s clear why Togashi is having issues writing the manga. Togashi knows Gon will have to develop without relying on his father because of his development thus far not having relied on his father. This brings us back to the first point, which is that Gon is able to achieve his successes on his own, so we don’t need his background to know him in a richer or more intimate way.
In the end, it seems Ging is contrasted more than compared to Gon, because it’s clear they are separate and different from each other when introduced in the last arc of the anime series. Togashi has had Gon forge his own path and it would feel like a waste if Gon’s character suddenly relied on someone else. Besides, there is no connection holding neither Ging nor Gon together.
We’ll have to wait to see what Togashi holds in store for us",10
"
                I consider this one of the best Anime I've ever seen. 
I'm writing this after a long time after finishing this.
In the following i will try to point out the good parts of Hunter x Hunters story the good and the bad parts and hopefully I will show you what to expect when you watch this story.
I will start with the Story.
The story was around a 8.5 before the chimera ant arc to me. I'll now give it a straight 10 though.
The story as is an adventure anime with fighting. It fills some of the stereotypes of the average adventure story. 
It isn't very predictable.
The
                  Story is divided into several arcs. It isn't finished and probably never will be finished since it's author is on hiatus due to illness.
The story is probably one of Hunter x Hunters biggest strength.
It get's very boring during arc changes and at the beginning of new arcs. 
But it then slowly builds up and describes a small living part in the world and shows what is happening to our characters in that part. It then uses the characters described in other arcs. While it focuses mainly around the characters displayed on the cover it often drifts away and describes other characters and what happens to them. 
Another strength of Hunter x Hunters story is that it stays true to itself. In a lot of other stories that describe other worlds the authors have difficulties of keeping the world consistent. They often have to introduce new types of magic or the magic suddenly changes it's nature very very often (Yeah I'm looking at you Naruto). However that doesn't happen in Hunter x Hunter.
A lot of scenes make you wonder whether they have a deeper meaning or not.  In very few cases you can directly see it.  But mostly they don't have any at all.
Towards me it's a straight 10.
Art: 
I have really no idea what I should rate here. I'm neither an artist nor do I aspire to be one. And which art exactly should I rate here?
The drawing style - How well it fits the story? Whether it describes what is happening or not? 
At least that's what I'm going to do here.
I think the drawing style differs only slightly from the average look. What I also liked about it is that there are a lot of ugly and odd people.
In a lot of other fighting Animes it is difficult to see what's going on. So the authors have to slow down the fight or use a lot of ""What just happened"" scenes (Optionally with another flashback scene). This doesn't happen here either. I also think that the Art fits the Story. But I can't really judge that.
As I'm unsure on how to rate this exactly I will give it only a very minor role in the final rating (5%). I will give it a 9 here.
Sound:
As far as I know the Sound was perfect except for one little thing.
The voice actor of one of the male characters is female. It's quite disturbing.
I will still give a 9 though.
Characters:
We have a lot of stereotype character here. Yet that doesn't decrease their depth. A lot of characters are introduced. Some were better some were worse. Some were enemies. Some were friends. All of them developed. And all of them had their own character - a thing that is pretty rare for an Anime with that many characters. 
But first and foremost they felt realistic. In a major amount of other Animes character are often very 1 Dimensional and always and only act upon their motivations. In Hunter x Hunter feelings are introduced as well as the fact that those feelings can take you over and completely wipe out your logic.
The characters are interesting and you can relate to them.
I will give a 10.
Enjoyment:
The Enjoyment is a tough one. On one hand you won't be able to take your eyes of the screen during arcs and especially during fights. You will just sit there with your Heart racing unable to sleep until that part is over. When suddenly it gets interrupted by a mind blowing scene (e.g. Fight against the Ant king). 
On the other hand you have to wait some time before it slowly but steadily starts building up. 
I chose to priorize the good scenes due to the fact that the boring moments are very few.
This results in an 10 rating.
Overall:
Taking everything into account I will give the 10 rating. If I were in a bad mood this would be an 8.4. And on good days you can find me contacting the administration of this site to ask them if they can increase the maximum rating to 11.5.
I hope you liked my first review.",10

                Why you should watch HxH? What things made me love this anime? Why is so great?...
Hunter x Hunter 2011 is not flawless, it has boring moments, ""meh"" episodes and arcs. The animation is not surprisingly outstanding all the way trough, and (in more than one occasion) you just want some of the characters to die due to how annoying they are. So... why?  Why is so good even after all this things? Well, lets view some aspects of the series...
STORY: 
  Gon wants to find he's dad, that's the story. Boring, no? Well that's because that is not the story. Hunter x Hunter
                  is about a world, a world full of different scenarios, dramas, inner problems & people, and those people are alive in HxH (keep that in mind till we start talking about the characters).
  Gon is just a tiny tiny grain of sand in a gigantic desert. Defining the ""story"" of Hunter Hunter in a few words is nearly impossible, so long story short, Hunter x Hunter 2011 is a huge world ready to be discovered.
ART & SOUND:
  The art in HxH is great, colourful & picturesque scenarios, diverse and complex character designs, well achieved immersive effects, ej: the ""nen auras"" of some blood lust characters, the sensation of fear, panic and sadness. 
  But the thing that i like the most in the art of this series, are the elements of the real world that the author bring into his work. There are tons and tons of references, events and things of our world in the anime, for example the references towards Kim Jong-Un, Christianity, Buddhism, the atomic bombs of Hiroshima & Nagasaki, and more...
  Sadness, overwhelming fear, happiness & joy, rage and epicness... You will not want the themes to end. The soundtracks of this series are not just complements, but emotions in its pure state and irreplaceable elements of the experience that is HxH. Pieces like ""Theme of Kage & Rasetsu"", ""Netero's Theme/ Restriction and Pledge"" and Shaiapouf playing the f*cking violin man! Those are things that make Hunter Hunter so characteristic.
CAST:
  You see, the problem with other series is that, sometimes, the characters don't make synergy, sometimes they don't work out because they're not feel alive, the goals that they fought for doesn't convince us and when they form part of a group it feels like they're joined by convenience of the plot rather than by realistic true bound.
  Togashi makes an outstanding work with his main cast and supporting characters, all of 'em are real personas, even the worst villains are full of hopes, aspirations and mindsets...
  The Phantom Troupe or Gen'ei Ryodan are probably one of the best organisations in the entire anime, manga, and literary history at bound/ relationship level. They're a group of merciless dreadful bandits, but before all, they are a family. Each and all of the members truly cares about the rest (or at least the former ones) like they were a real bloodline family. You can feel the camaraderie between them and how the fight, tease, respect and love each other. Their bonds are so close that even if they are cold blooded assassins they will cry rivers and won't forgive anyone that hurts the other members of the Ryodan.
  Besides their goal is not the cliche ""We are *** and we will rule over the world"" nah, their aspiration is to live free and do whatever they want, like a big family. And that's what makes them feel like proper people, they could be breaking in a art gallery and robbing all the art pieces, and just then go to their base to play card games and joke each other. The Phantom Troupe is not just a plot device, they are actual feeling people full of drives and emotions.
  The Royal Guard, formed by Neferpitou/ Shaiapouf and Menthuthuyoupi are also a fascinating example of deep realistic characters.",10
"
                Throughout showing anime to others, I have realized that people tend to like Hunter x Hunter more than any other anime. This surprises me because I imagine people would dismiss this series based on seeing the goofy and kiddy looking cartoon characters. Not only that but I always thought people would be impatient with this series considering that it is longer than most anime.
I theorize that people love hunter x hunter for its brimming bright and colorful world, its captivating and eccentric characters, and its dynamic and thought-provoking battles. It is a very strange and off the wall series, yet it is so effective at
                  engaging its audience. It is great at flowing throughout each arc despite how drastically different the tones and plot are in each one. Explaining this series to someone is difficult because there are a variety of plot points to be mentioned but doing so will spoil the viewer. You can say that Hunter x Hunter is about a boy named Gon who is pursuing being a hunter to find his deadbeat father but a majority of the time, you probably won’t be thinking about that goal. Plus, Gon is not the main focus of the story despite being the main character. Hell, he isn’t really around in the chapters taking place after the anime. When watching hunter x hunter, you are more focused on the journey and short term goals our characters have in mind rather than constantly wanting Gon to find his father.
Hunter x Hunter is also known for having one of the if not the most complex power systems out of any shounen. I don’t want to spoil anyone but it is quite an interesting idea Togashi came up with. I honestly can’t tell you how it works off the top of my head. Despite there being clear power levels between characters, it rarely ever feels like characters win simply because they are stronger than the other. While there definitely are moments decided by power level, a majority of the battles in this anime involve trying to outsmart the opponent. Not only that but Togashi does an amazing job keeping his main characters in check. He never allows them to be exceedingly overpowered yet he is still able to have them improve both physically and mentally. 
Hunter x Hunter not only has an amazing main cast but it also has amazing side characters and antagonists as well. The characters are part of what makes the series interesting because a lot of the characters you see can be seen as abnormal and insane. It is an interesting dynamic used because it makes the story exceedingly unpredictable and does a great job of contrasting with characters that can be seen as more human and empathetic.
The animation is more than solid and the soundtrack contains a variety of breathtaking and endearing pieces. It is impressive that madhouse was able to stay consistent and add exceedingly divergent soundtracks throughout Hunter x Hunters production.
Overall, this series was quite the experience to watch. It is an unconventional yet intriguing series and I highly recommend giving this series a shot if you haven’t. I promise that you won’t regret it.",10
"
                Hunter x Hunter is the definition of perfection. The characters, music, visuals, storyline and art style are all astonishing.
Visuals 
The visuals stay nothing less than mind-blowing. Absolutely amazing animation. A lot of anime's in this genre, especially ones that are based around a lot of combat and go over 100 episodes, tend to get a little sloppy with presentation after a while. However, this anime, in fact, does the opposite and the animation improves astonishingly throughout.
Music 
The music nailed everything. I listen to Hunter x Hunter music everyday, and never get bored of it. Some OST's are so emotional, tears run down your face from
                  just hearing them. Others are so epic, it's as if it forces you to turn up the volume to full so you can appreciate and experience the awesomeness of a piece.
Characters 
There is not a single character that i ever felt was annoying or had no purpose or were not developed enough. Even the smaller roles and extras, all had so much detail into their design and personality. This anime makes you really get to know every single person and have some sort of relationship with them.
Protagonists 
The four protagonists: Gon, Killua, Kuapika and Leorio are the heart and soul of this anime. Especially Gon and Killua. Seeing the two total opposites make a tight relationship, and watching it grow is really the bread and butter of the story. One coming from a happy childhood and another from brutal torture; there was nothing to make this any better. They all have their goals and dreams and it's amazing watching them develop through their many adventures with and without each other.
Storyline 
The storyline is on a different level to anything I have ever read, seen or watched in my lifetime. The story is so mind-blowing, so shockingly elaborate, you will never be bored. For 148 episodes, to never have one of them bore you seems impossible, however, this one does it to perfection. The contrast of moods and genres change so swiftly it all works together perfectly. The beginning feels like your watching a happy family friendly anime. But by episode 50, it becomes so gory, so violent, so intense, even adults look away.
Morals 
The greatest aspect of this is that it's not just a fight against good and evil. Sometimes to roles of evil swap between the protagonists and their rivals. All the characters are human and suffer through difficulties of life. Whatever those are, it can make someone a good person or a bad person. Watching the righteous and the unrighteous swap roles is really breathtaking.
It even makes you question your own goodness, or whether if we as a human race have any at all. 
Conclusion 
 I rated it 10/10, as i feel nothing i have watched, can top it in the aspects of characters, visuals, music and art style. Hunter x Hunter is the best anime out there.",10
"
                Dropped the anime, seen 18-19 episodes.
Too many cliches and unfunny jokes, I had that feeling where I was like ""hmm is the episode gonna end already?"" It didn't make me want to see more or even keep focused on the episode ahead of me, I've seen too many shonen types like this one that it just starts getting annoying at some point.
As for the characters... we have Killua and Gon.. yea, no. Same boring brother-like vibe between them as in every other show, up to episode 18 I couldn't give a shit if one of them died, or did anything really, that's part of the
                  reason I dropped it. The anime lacks...a lot, I'm not even going to go in detail with that.
At the end of the day, is HxH a bad anime just because I don't like it and I think its overrated? No, that doesn't mean its bad, just not for me, that's why I decided to give it a 5.
I do not recommend this anime.",5
"
                Hunter X Hunter is shonen done right. It has the best of all the tropes, great characters, and solid plot lines. If you like shonen anime, I wouldn't be able to comprehend how you wouldn't enjoy HxH.  Even if you don't, I'd argue HxH is done well enough for most anime fans to enjoy it.
HxH did everything right. It is a show that literally cannot be improved in my humble opinion (except for that non-ending ending). It's pacing is superb (It gets good faster than any long shonen series), it has no fillers, and even the worst arcs are still good. The story and
                  the world Hunter develops is just really damn good, and the characters feel real. They have depth and are more than just one-dimensional shonen clones.  
I suppose you could say the series lacks romance and isn't super big on the humor, but outside of that I don't know what else you can ask of an anime that Hunter doesn't provide. I keep my average rating of shows pretty low (6.5) so that a 9 or a 10 carry weight as a ranking. Let me assure you, HxH is a 10. It is a masterpiece.",10
"
                This is a truly spectacular anime. Before getting into it I thought, from the synopsis that this would be another cheesy adventure trope. However, getting into the anime I realised it was so much more. 
Every single character from minor antagonists to major protagonists have a deep backstory, beautiful design, and, most importantly, a truly marvellous character arc.  Every character is so deep, they are like real people, whom value aspects of society and relationships. 
Each story arch is beautifully constructed with their own well thought out plot, and fantastic antagonists. Honestly, some of the 'bad guys' were my favourite character ever. 
While this
                  is the longest anime I've seen, it certainly didn't feel that way Nearly all other story's I have encountered have dropped off and made me bored at times, and at those times I have dreaded picking up that story again. HxH has never done so, I have always been fully engaged with the story and it's characters. Even character's I expected not to like turned out to be really great.
From Killua and Gon, Kurapika and Leorio, Knuckle and Shoot, to the Phantom Troup, Hisoka, and Illumi, I was captivated by each and every chartacter.",10
"
                My first exposure to this show was the Original series . I watched 7-8 episodes . Though the show seemed decent , overall it was dull for me . Which lead me to drop it way back in the past . Years later I came across the reboot of the series and Frankly speaking , its an Epic show and Well made by the concerned Production house .
Though the series has a slow start , its colorful and beautiful art keeps you glued to the screen . As episodes pass by , You start feeling the Darkness of the Story . The Power ass pulls
                  are next to none . Well explained techniques and power ups . Well balanced story and Fitting Character personalities and Character development .
One the Story part , Series after a Slow start in the season 1 , moves to the fifth gear , where we witness real Action in the story . By the time one reaches Chimera Ant arc , most People would love it . But here is the real deal , The Final arc though appears to be Weak on Character side , It engulfs you with its pure Dark and Emotional story . The ending of the Arc makes even the stone heart Men cry .
Sounds and Characters compliment the story in a great way . The Voice artists have done a great job in bringing Characters to life . In most anime shows , Characters often feel lifeless but here in HxH we have characters who can be felt . As if there is nothing different between you and them . One can clearly feel the emotions of these Characters .
This is a Highly enjoyable series . Its worth your time . 
Before I end , I recommend this to ALL",10

                Overall 10
It was an amazing anime, Yes! I loved the journey with Gon and the his final fight was breathtaking!!! It was all worth it. I have never been so content after watching an anime before. The artwork was a bit weird but I grew to like it as I kept on watching. OMG i want to say so much about this but lemme tell you, the ending is the best!!! 
No ark was useless and each was worth watching. The way they handled Ging as a prize from the start but then overshadowed it with more pressing emotions and encounters was amazing. I was
                  even able to connect with the enemies and understand their reasons. No character was truly bad so to say and I enjoyed each of their stories. Amazing chracter development!!!
I would recommend this to anyone who likes adventure anime cuz this one is a must watch!!! I was a bit let down by the animation quality at first too but trust me, the story line and character development will completely overpower you and you would definitely start feeling like each episode was just like 2 minutes long(more so nearing the end) xD. Well goodluck to y'all, I promise you will enjoy this, I don't write review regularly except from when I truly love or hate some anime (xD if u r guessing in this case its love). See ya!! My hunt for more great anime continues :3",10

                Yeah! Hunter x Hunter 2011! Woo! And no big feelings text here about it
Story 9/10 - We start here: Gon is some random Shonen protagonist who is willing to become a Hunter. That's the basic of the 1st season. There's 6 seasons (the 5th is the biggest one) and a lot of things happens in these. It's pretty good
Art 10/10 - MADHOUSE IS SO GOOD AAAHHHH *bungee gum* The art is  so colorful and good-looking!
Sound 8/10 - Yeah, the soundtrack is pretty good, but is it wrong to change the opening? It's not bad, it just get too boring after 3 seasons
Characters 10/10
                  - Each character is so unique! Like, Gon's innocent but mature, Killua is an assassin but still a child, Leorio is... useless... Kurapika is pure vengeance but a friend, Hisoka is a pedophile clown who is always super-gay and mysterious, and etc!
Enjoyment 8/10 - The anime is very good, but the lack of fights is big. There is only some 2 or 3 good fights
Overall 9/10 Hunter x Hunter 2011 is SOOO GOOD, but it needs more fights. BUT STILL SO GOOOD",9

                i dont often write reviews but i just finished this anime and as a shonen fan, this has to be one of the best shone i have seen. I will keep this brief and to the point.
HxH has some of the best arcs and fighting scenes and impeccable writing. Wjat draws me in is the focus it has on character development and how well it does. I am very picky when it comes to it and if I see lazy char development I get annoyed but in HXH its damn well done. 
Ofc gon and killua are strong MCs but its not that they get
                  strong suddenly, you see the effect the training and the fights have on them, they are also not the strongest characters in the anime even by the end and it just shows how much this show has left to offer (holding hopes that it comes back).
Secondly the arcs are amazing, it starts off like ur regular shonen and it develops at a great pace, but the way hxh takes issues from IRL and makes it work.Im glad they chose gon and killua two adorable 12yr olds as mc's coz its such a big contrast to the shit that goes down, AND U JUST WANNA ROOT FOR THESE TWO ;-;
thirdly the characters oh my god literally I did not expect to be crying when the show ended or when gon and killua said goodbye. LIKE I WANT MORE OR ATLEAST I WANTED THEM TO STAY TOGETHER. their duo is one of the best I have seen and I love character duos like this. Its such a pure relationship ;-; i love everything about these two and they are prolly my two fav mc's in a shonen. THEN THE VILLAISN OH MY GOD THE VILLAISN ARE SO WELL WRITTEN. ITS NOT THE SIMPLE ""let's create sympathy for this evil guy"" ITS SO MUCH MORE COMPLEX. the characters feel like real humans like despite the power gon, killua, hisoka, illumi, meruem..like all the characters good or bad act like humans so its so gray (except maybe hisoka and illumi lmao) like u cant just judge them easily. ITS SO WELL CRAFTED 
lastlyyy i need to say this and this is one of my fav things about this anime...NO FILLERS. this anime doesn't waste time, like every character had a purpose and every arc led to the development of the mc's. There were arcs lighter than some but they all mattered and I LOVED IT SO MUCH. fillers can be soooo annoying esp if not done right (ahem ahem) BUT THIS ANIME IS JUST...IT MADE ME SO HAPPY FROM START TO FINISH
.
BASICALLY
GO
WATCH 
HUNTER X HUNTER
like if u are a fan of shonen like me and u haven't seen this, ur missing out.",10
"
                Hunter X  Hunter is pretty.. well..  it it makes no pretense about it being pretty similar to Dragon Ball Z, so it's about a kid and his journey to become a Hunter like his father, but to get there, he has to meet all these martial and fighting achievements in order to obtain that. 
Ok, so... just getting to the point was not a major fan of HxH, it was fine, but there really wasn't a single thing that DBZ didn't do better so far as I could tell. 
In fact, one character whose moves are based on arcane finance and accounting rules
                  such as compound interest, which is like whoa! I mean I think HxH is almost like a comedy in some ways not so much like a fighting thing in Dragon Ball Z, but this seemed to go far off into an almost parody direction basically. 
Anyway, most of the characters in HxH are jerks. Meruem? Jerk. The Phantom Troupe? All jerks. Gon's dad? Seems like a jerk. Everyone in HxH is just kind of this reckless jerk and they don't really seem to care who they hurt, just as long as they get to fight. 
It's kinda similar to Death Note, in many ways, there is the give and take, back and forth, ripsaw and such that you have there, but also as in the review with Death Note it's missing that extra-intense kind of rage really and chaos of Dragon Ball Z that made it so unique.
Instead, it's kind of replaced with this sort of mellowed out kind of genuine feeling but nonetheless not quite as exciting sentiment. There would of been a lot more to say about HxH if it came prior to DBZ, but as was not the case can only simply say it is simply like a very, very lite version of DBZ. 
On the positive side, though, some of the characters could be sort of fun at times like Kurapika, Leorio, and Gon. 
I think in some ways Killua is kind of the character that made HxH just not fun for me, it was really terrible how he would just assassinate people in the anime and not really feel anything about it. Gon was ok I think but Killua I just couldn't really get behind it at all in the end.  
I think HxH is like that character that is super intense and knowledgeable about all kinds of things, but I can't help but think they were often that way because they were so afraid of things, what it was I can't say... but it just felt like there was a fear about the world or things that kept them in a state of great distress and such. 
I mean, I feel like HxH could be realllly funny and engaging but it feels kind of stressed out dealing with certain things, I don't know, I feel like I should like it more or something but it just seems kind of troubled.. 
I didn't think HxH was bad really, but they really should have a nicer side to them or find one somewhere!
There is also a sense of emptiness that pervades other aspects of the anime, you don't ever get to see Gon's parents really for more than a few seconds or as part of a flashback. It's such an interesting comparison to DBZ also where Gohan and so on are such integral parts of the story...
Finally, there is the earlier version of HxH (96 or 97 I believe?) which based on the trailer and such looks quite a bit better. 
Overall, Hunter X Hunter just felt pretty empty and distressing. So, a 6.",6
"
                When I first heard the name of HxH, I only heard wonders of this story and it was cataloged as a masterpiece not only of the shonen neketsu, not only of the shonen demography, but also a masterpiece of anime and even the works of fiction, everything was excellent or the best in some fields according to the critics and the public, therefore he had super high expectations, however he could not reach them and he stayed in the middle of the journey.
The first arc, which is the exam arc, made me boring, there are almost 5 chapters in which you simply see the characters
                  running and sae in a tunnel or in the forest, we see the introduction of some characters and if this presentation is okay But they could do better the arc itself, they introduced us to Hisoka as a villain but the presentation did not manage to be as impressive as it should be, although the character is very good, although my biggest problem with this is that the term Hunter is a very ambiguous one, You can be a hunter of almost anything, so it is confusing to see the tests because you do not know what they are for, that is, what they are going to serve also the Hunters are elite people the best of the best in some aspect and it is super difficult to become one however our protagonist being a child makes it convenient, also the Hunters have many benefits but why? And why, if it is so important, they do not do a review of the people who become Hunters? Also, as I said, the arc was boring and did not widen the world of history and being a neketsu one would expect at least some battles to make it more interesting, but except for an appearance by Killua and some by Hisoka, the arc did not present action either.
The arc of going to rescue Killua only served as an excuse for the characters to have a power up that would only apply to the next arc because in the rest of the work this force that they won would not be demonstrated and I wonder how it is that a damn child and a teenager without any training could open a door of weight tonalas in just days, and well the history of the zoldick family was interesting but it does not contribute anything else.
the sky coliseum arc presents us with the power system of the story that the truth is this is a point in favor since it is very well explained and has no inconsistencies of power in the series, however we return to the same thing is an arc boring and tasteless, an arc in which killua and gon go over everyone with a single push that is, they couldn't do something more creative? then when they reach a certain point they get stuck and have to learn the nen and they learn it super fast this with the excuse that they are prodigies although from killua I understand it since after all he comes from a family of murderers and has superhuman abilities but gon is a boy who lived with his aunt on an island and it seems that he can eat the world and hope that this is credible just with the excuse that he is a child prodigy?
And although the first part was boring because they defeated everyone with 1 blow, I thought that after the nen the fights would be better, however it was equally or worse than boring, having only 1 fight that is worth it that was the one with gon against Hisoka. In general terms, this arc could be summarized in 1 chapter that explained the nen and because literally the only relevant thing apart from that was that they got a lot of money.
then came the arc of the añaras and kurapika that was fine except for the end that was very disappointing but without major complaints.
the gree island arc is the worst, another training arc that can be summarized in 1 chapter but they extended it to a whole arc with a villain and super convenient and mediocre situations.
The arc of the chimera ants was splendid although in my opinion it was a little longer but it was very very good.
and the final arc was also mediocre but I know except that the protagonist was killua who is a spectacular character and with an incredible evolution, added to the beautiful brotherhood of him with alluka and some interesting scenes. But this arc is nefarious argumentatively that is to say Alluka is a deux is machina with literal legs what she did does not make sense because of her, she revives it if without more that is to say they have the power of a literal God and this only generates plot holes for That there was never mention of this before besides that if they had such power because not only Killua took Alluka and killed Meruem and the other ants and revived Kite and thus everything was solved, talking about Kite was also another error that is to say The catalyst for Gon's spectacular development in the last arc was due to his death but it turned out that he reincarnated into a Chimera Ant and although it was hinted that the ants had memories of their past life it was very difficult that one of them could generate all their personality and other features completely but wow conveniently Kite does it, this arc narratively ruins the chimera arc but of course as HunterxHunter seems like an untouchable anime, no one highlights these errors and becomes a masterpiece.
To conclude, my biggest problems with the show is that the only very good thing focuses only on the chimeras arc and if the only good thing about your work is only in 1 arc and this is the one that carries all the weight on its back Of the work, no matter how good it is, it cannot raise the level of the rest of the mediocre things, that is to say in retrospect Hunter is good but it is not by far a masterpiece since most of the arches are mediocre, the one with the spiders is good but until then, it is nothing spectacular and the chimeras if it is sublime but that does not turn it into a masterpiece.
Added to this is Gon since he is not as good a protagonist as he poses or at least for me, since at no time could I empathize with him, the main thing is the basis of the character that is his motivation, this is to become a hunter for see how his father felt and apart from that going in search of his father I mean what the hell? your father who abandoned you when you were a baby and did not even visit you or anything like that and you want to go after him, how stupid. Second, Gon is a character that does not evolve, he has some flashes between the arches but he relapses and his true evolution comes in that of the chimeras but he feels inorganic because he gets bad, to the point of wanting to kill someone for the sake of it. death of a person who only met 1 time as a child and saw him again after almost 10 years and spent only 2 weeks with the bone that makes no sense, but although it was splendid what they did with him in that arc the act of transforming to a pure soul in a demon just for revenge was very good although as I said it did not feel genuine but very forced besides that it is the only evolution of the character because for the rest he remains as the noble and good boy who believes in him good of all, even in the final arc after all that he lived, he does not learn anything and ends the same as how he started, a naive child with the desire to meet the father who abandoned him without caring and remains as noble as ever.
Unlike Killua that if he constantly evolves in the series, if he were the only protagonist, this would be more points. And this is something positive to emphasize since with the exception of Gon, most of the relevant characters in the series are very well built, so good are they that each one could easily have a spin-off of them and it would be good.
And the other thing that does not make Hunter such a good series are that, as I said, the only acceptable thing is concentrated in 1 arc and the very good in another, the rest of the series does not contribute anything since they are mostly arches to train and increase your power with very bad background frames, when this training could be done in 1 or 2 chapters they lengthen it by creating whole arcs, and it is very boring in general.
good in order 6/10.

                Hunter X Hunter, to be concise, is a stellar anime overall, especially for a Shounen. Many Shounen anime have a tendency to repeat themselves, rehashing the same tropes that have been used since Dragonball's debut in the 1980s. In addition most lack quality writing, well-developed characters, poor pacing, have an emphasis on style over substance. This being said, Hunter x Hunter (2011) not only avoids these flaws, but goes above and  beyond what is to be expected from the genre, and is an excellent anime regardless of target audience or genre. 
Story: (9/10) 
+ Strong Plot 
+ Rich world/setting 
+ Well-written fights  
-
                  sluggish pacing at times 
-  overuse of narration. 
 The story begins as one might expect of an action/adventure series. There is a clear objective for the protagonist from the get-go, and quickly proceeds to the first arc. There is not much explanation of the setting initially but is gradually revealed throughout the series. Given how many episodes there are (148), the series can take its time to create the world and develop the setting. This may be an advantage for the series in that it doesn't have to overwhelm the viewers with information at the beginning, but it also presents a challenge in that the world has to be fully-fleshed out, and must provide very unique story arcs and characters. Thankfully, the series does both in spades. The world is massive, while fascinating. Every  location and destination feels different, and has significant depth for the characters to explore. In doing so, each arc provides unique tasks, characters, and challenges, for the main cast to overcome.  The world-building is simply among the best there is.  
    Given the setting, there is both a complex overarching plot, and the story arcs themselves. Events may happen or occur in the background outside the story-arc, but it never becomes difficult to understand or follow. This fact that the story isn't confusing and overly-complicated does not mean the writing suffers. On the contrary, the writing is superior to most shows, anime or otherwise, I've seen. The plot does not become repetitive, and you can never expect what happens next. As you think you've got it all figured out, there's a twist, yet it never comes across as silly or unrealistic. I've found that there are very few plot holes or inconsistencies throughout the entire story.  
     One of the best and attractive aspects of Hunter x Hunter by far, is its fights. Even if the plot and writing overall were sub-par, the way the fights are orchestrated and presented could still redeem much of the series. I've found that the  writing of the fights is among the best I""ve ever seen. They are complex, filled with twists, and never become stale. Without spoiling it, the way the characters fight tend to be very different, and characters will use every advantage they can in order to win. Though there are some stomps in the series, fights are not decided necessarilly by any one factor. Some characters counter each others' fighting styles, are stronger, smarter, faster etc, but rarely is the fight decided by any one factor. Fights can last anywhere from a few seconds, to 20 or so episodes, and although a fight may be very lopsided, they keep you on the edge of your seat. The fighters, especially towards the end of the  series, are very tactically savvy and intelligent. There were many times where I thought I was an idiot compared to the characters in the show, but this is more of a testament to the excellence of the writing than my own stupidity, or at least I would hope so. You will seldom find anime with fights as well-written and executed as Hunter x Hunter. 
     Like any series, the story is not perfect. My biggest criticism of the anime is the pacing. There are times when conflicts and story arcs feel dragged on for way too long, and  there are points within the series where I would complain ""Just move on already"". The pacing is by far the weakest aspect of the series. The other qualm I had with the story, which is somewhat related to the pacing, is the amount of superfluous explanation. Resolution and explanation is difficult to criticize because  preference varies from person to person, and explanation must strike a fine balance between outright subjectivity and utter lack of clarity, to excessive explanation. There are certainly times where there is some explanation and resolution is to be desired, but it's absurd to explain every single mundane aspect of a story. One of the most frustrating moments in the series is when the narrator explains how the passcode to an elevator works for about eight minutes. While some narration may be effective, it is important to allow the viewer to think for themselves from time to time.  Other than that though, I don't have much to gripe about.  
Art (10/10) 
+ Stellar animation 
+ Vibrant characters/locations
+ Beautiful fights 
 Once again, Madhouse proves that they are among the best in the business. I've always though that viewers have put too much emphasis on the quality of the animation, and will simply avoid excellent anime simply because it isn't as crisp in comparison. Anime most certainly is a visual media, and while animation is important, it is only part of the visual experience. In addition, the quality of the animation should not be evaluated on just as smooth or beautiful it is, but on whether or not it enhances or detracts from the series. For an action-packed series like Hunter x Hunter, animation is very important, but for a comedy or slice of life anime, it isn't quite as important. Even with inferior quality animation, superior direction and technical aspects such as lighting, angles, and detail can certainly compensate. Recycling models and crappy drawing can significantly detract from the visuals in an anime, regardless of its generation. 
     The animation in Hunter x Hunter, is everything one would want in an action anime. Beautiful lighting, crisp movements, and smooth frames are prevalent throughout the series, and despite its length, never really suffers. The fights are simply spectacular. During the less action-packed moments, there is a large amount of attention to detail. The visual quality of the scenes in many anime in this genre tends to suffer, but in Hunter x Hunter, this is certainly not the case. Characters move realistically, are often times moving, rather than standing still with only their mouths moving, and you can notice the subtlest facial expressions of the characters. The overall quality, as well as the consistency, of the animation makes most series, regardless of genre, pale in comparison.  
    Art, depending on the series, can vary dramatically, and thus not all series should be evaluated the same way. Are the characters supposed to be realistic? Do the characters all look the same? Do the side characters have as much attention to detail as the main cast? I don't believe art as a whole, can't and should not be valuated objectively. This being said,, there is not an excuse to be lazy. In the case of Hunter x Hunter, the setting is rather fantastical. The characters are intended to be distinct and very easy to differentiate. In other words, it's perfectly fine if it isn't completely realistic. As for how Hunter x Hunter manages to illustrate its world, it does so extremely well. There are innumerable characters, but they all look varied, and are well-drawn. They are eye-catching and easily maintain the attention of the viewer. The diversity of the world matches the diversity of the cast. As an integral part of world-building, it is imperative that the settings be able to reflect the progress in the story and the characters' transitions from one place to another. A world as large as Hunter x Hunter's should heterogeneous with plenty of variety. Hunter x Hunter is just this, and is truly a sight to behold. 
     I would have to be very nit picky if I was to criticize the visuals of Hunter x Hunter. Honestly, my only complaint is that it is occasionally difficult to tell where characters are in fights \, and the shots taken could be taken at better angles. These are more subjective though, and I'm sure plenty would, understandably, disagree.   
Sound (7/10) 
+ Excellent voice acting 
+ Music is used appropriately. 
- Unmemorable soundtrack 
	In all honesty, the sound for Hunter x Hunter is its weakest aspect. Its biggest strength lays with its characters. Every character’s personality is well conveyed and interesting. None of the characters feel cheesy or lacking. Whether the character is comical, serious, lighthearted, or devious, it is easy to discern how the character is attempting to sound like, regardless of what the character actually may be thinking. Subtle changes in tone are well captured, and none of the characters are monotonous. As will be mentioned later in this review, the voices are inextricable from the characters themselves. 
	This all being said, the soundtrack is nothing out of the ordinary. For such a long series, one would expect a large variety of tracks, and maybe some noteworthy ones. This, unfortunately, is not the case. In the beginning, instrumental versions of the opening and the insert-song are used frequently, and get old very quickly. In all of the series, I cannot think of a noteworthy track. Luckily, the music that is used is used appropriately. It successfully conveys the mood of what is occurring. More importantly, it does not play music irrelevant to the setting. There are no melancholic tracks during comical moments and vice-versa. Overall, the sound is certainly not bad, but you will be disappointed if you are planning to add some anime tracks to your playlist. 
Characters (9/10) 
+ Strong protagonists and antagonists 
+ No foils or characters as mere plot devices 
+ Significant depth within characters  
+ Characters behave somewhat realistically  
+ Complex and intriguing relationships
- Character development occurs late in the series 
Shounen anime are not known for their strong characters. By “strong” I don’t mean strong physically or mentally, but strong as far as a well-written character.  Protagonists tend to have a notorious reputation for having one-dimensional personalities, little depth, a small amount of character development. This phenomenon pervades innumerable anime, and is one of the reasons why many “mainstream” anime are considered by some to be overrated. The side-characters are little different, with recycled tropes such as the whimpy guy, the mentor, the obligatory female character, etc. Luckily, Hunter x Hunter avoids this issue entirely. I won’t spoil much  about the two protagonists, but it’s impossible to evaluate the characters without talking about them somewhat. 
     Gon is the primary protagonist of Hunter x Hunter. At first glance, he seems little different than many protagonists in Shounen. He’s a young boy, energetic, ambitious, and fairly strong. He has one general goal that persists through the entirety of the series, and goals that span each story arc. For most of the first arc, he maintains this appearance. However, he quickly realizes that he is not nearly as strong as he think he is, and that the world is far more complicated than he had imagined. Neverthe less, he persists and become stronger. One unique aspect of Gon is just how weak he is. Sure, he’s much stronger than the average citizen, but he is outclassed by many of his opponents. Instead of charging at his opponents, he must be resourceful and cunning if he wants to win. As he accumulates experience, he becomes a more skilled fighter and tactician, relying on his wits as much as his strength, leading to even more dynamic and interesting fights as the series progresses. In regards to Gon’s morality, as well as what he believes, he somewhat differs than most protagonists. He is most certainly likeable, and tries to do the “right” thing, but oftentimes his naivety and his easily earned trust gets him into trouble. The series conveys the message that the world and its characters are far more grey. The result of all this, is that Gon does not shape the world, but is shaped by the world. 	
            Killua is the secondary protagonist of the series. In many ways, he is portrayed as the opposite of Gon. He is far more serious, mature, and calculating. However, Killua is more than just a foil for Gon, but a character who both influences and is influenced by Gon. While Killua’s character and actions embody the cold hearted nature of the world, he finds what he has been missing throughout his life in Gon. It is through gone in which Killua experiences the majority of his development although he does experience development on his own. Unlike Gon, Killua is fairly powerful from the beginning. He’s a very experienced fighter and relies on tactics and cunning more than brute force, although he is in no way physically weak.
 This contrast between protagonists, often portrayed as hero vs anti-hero, is a frequent trope in Shounen anime, but the way through which this contrast is explored is unique in Hunter x Hunter. As aforementioned, the two protagonists influence each other and complement each other. Gon certainly receives more attention during the beginning of the show, but further in they share almost the same amount of screentime. If there is any apparent lack of depth in either character, it is compensated for  through the other protagonist’s presence.  
    An action/adventure Shounen style anime is incomplete without its villains, and Hunter x Hunter’s villains are some of the most memorable I’ve ever seen. Although they are sometimes portrayed as obstacles for the main cast to defeat, they are never mere obstacles, but rather fully-fleshed out characters. No two villains are alike, and they each have their own personalities, complex relationships, motives, and emotions. This may not seem anything extraordinary, but for many villains in anime or any other media, these features are often lacking. Most villains are known just for their motives and actions, and nothing else. With some exceptions, the majority of villains cannot be seen as wholly evil. They show sides of humanity, and in some cases it is hard to debate their own motives. It is one thing to give a villain depth, but it is much harder to make a villain dynamic. There are plenty of series that have character development, or substantive backstories for their villains, but oftentimes the development of the villains themselves is neglected. In Hunter x Hunter however, the villains, whether they be major or minor, feel far more human. They question their motives, show signs of weakness, and react to situations very differently. Because of the series’ scope, many of the villains appear and disappear, but most of them are very memorable and easily recognizable. One would think that with a series as large as Hunter x Hunter, the villains would become stale as they are introduced, but each one feels unique. 
    I do have a few, albeit minor, criticisms of the  show’s characters. The biggest one being the lack of development for most of the series. Ironically, most of the side cast and villains have far more time actually developing their character for most of the series. It is only in the latter half of the anime where we get to see the protagonists start to change significantly. My other criticism would not apply to the source material, but to the anime. The series is long, but does not encompass the entirety of the source material. As a result, there are several characters who have a great deal of time spent developing their character, only to have them disappear from the anime entirely.   
Overall (10/10)
     Hunter x Hunter is a must-watch for any fan of action/adventure anime. Whether it be for someone new to the medium, or for a veteran, this series is everything one would want out of the genre. Its rich world and story, its diverse and dynamic set of characters, and incredible fights are sure to keep one’s attention for the whole 148 episodes.",10

                “It takes a mere second for treasure to turn to trash.” - Hisoka
ok so ill start this review because this is one my favorite animes of all time so i will explain why it is what it is.
Story 10/10:it is a good story at first u might think o its generic oh boy are you wrong dont be quick to judge or else this anime will give u a expereince of shounen u never felt before
Art:10/10 the manga art sucks but combined the story with the new remade art it makes a compelling combo the art is beautiful
Sound: 9/10 at times the sound went down
                  a bit all in all sound was good
Character 10/10: one of the strong points of this anime was the characters oh my lord it is so fluent and so well made that u can describe them as human there arent static in the slightest they are perfect characters that i enjoy watching like hisoka for example he is a enemy but also a anti-hero he just helps him out because he wants to.
Enjoyment: 10/10 i really enjoyed this show because at first i was like its good but then later i was really absorbed.
Overall 10/10: i really enjoyed this show i highly reccomend it if u havent seen it go watch it like rn.
also it goes into themes no regular shounen would want to.",10

                This show is simply exceptional. My only complaint is that the story isn't finished. The writer really needs to continue to add to it because this is one of my all-time favorites. 
The animation is exceptional, the colors so potent and the characters all look very creative and fascinating. There are so many fun characters of all varieties, from comical to dark and intensely thought-provoking. 
The beginning of the series grabbed me right away as it gave off a vibe of cheeriness and fun that was very potent. Yet as it continues the story gets even more broad and takes so many turns that are
                  very unexpected. There are so many fun and interesting side adventures, and even the small moments of the show stay with you. I found myself enjoying nearly every moment that the show went along out of pure glee and anticipation for what comes next. The cheery atmosphere of the beginning isn't to be mistaken for how the show always is, for there are definitely some intensely emotional and dark moments that are equally as intoxicating. 
All around this series was a huge joy to watch. It outdid itself as it went along and really shined throughout. Such a wonderful and imaginative show with a plethora of adventures and characters to really get immersed with. 
Taking a journey with Gon as he tries to become a hunter, find his father, and make friends and enemies along the way was well worth it and was time spent extremely well. I find myself thinking about this story time and time again and almost wishing I could watch it for the first time all over again to relive the experience.",10

                Hunter x Hunter is the magnum opus of anime AND my life, it has changed my view on so many things and gives me another reason to wake up in the morning, but, there is one major problem, and this problem is only prominent in one episode.
This episode, was EPISODE 148. 
The last thing you would want to do to a fragile person like me is take away the one thing I care about most, and in this case, that's Hunter x Hunter! This anime NEEDS another season, I know you have ideas for it Togashi, p l e a s e.
Anyway, enough bickering. I
                  will now explain to you why the show is so magnificent and how many times I have sat there crying to myself ""this is too good"".
The characters in this show were immaculate. All of the character were incredibly complex, you don't just look at the characters and say to yourself ""that's the happy one"", the characters have many sides to their personality and these sides are perfectly represented through the show. One of my favourite characters are Illumi; I love how he acted so cold and psychopathic all the time yet he still had a ""soft spot"" for Killua, when I say soft spot I don't mean in a pure way, but you can tell that Illumi cares for Killua in his own way which just makes him so interesting. The relationships between the characters are also really good, you can't help but think that Gon and Killua simp for each other but this is really just because the relationships are written so well (Not saying that 'Killugon' is invalid) I could go on about the characters all day so I will now talk about the storyline.
Something other people constantly praise about Hunter x Hunter is how there is not ONE filler episode throughout the whole series (148 episodes) which it pretty amazing. Each episode is new and exciting with new ideas, you can never get bored during this show. I might add, each arc is different and intriguing. 
Some people seem to say that the pacing isn't perfect and I suppose I agree, there are some times where the pacing seems quite slow but it's not like that's much of a problem because it doesn't happen too much. 
If you're wondering why I didn't rate art a 10, it's not that the art was flawed it just wasn't something that stood out for me. It was unique and great, but not an art style I would actively try to replicate if you know what I mean, but for it's time it was very visually pleasing. So I give it a 9/10. 
I am lowkey obsessed with every character in this TV show, I am not a soft person, I  laughed at the ending of 'Your lie in April' (don't hate me please) and it lead me to believe I could never cry during a movie or TV show but this anime proved me wrong. It made me feel so hard, especially around the end and I cried 3 times which is a lot for me. 
I might admit, I got a bit bored during the Chimera ant arc, some parts were just a bit too repetive for me but the ending made it worth it.
If you're reluctant to watching it WATCH IT, you won't regret it.
Ok bye-",10

                *THIS IS A SPOILER-FREE REVIEW OF THE 2011 ANIME ADAPTION OF HUNTER X HUNTER 2011*
Hunter x Hunter is an anime that pushes being a shonen and if anything is more like a seinen. It starts off slow, light-hearted, and a bit cheesy, but if you give this series time, trust me, you will love it. This series starts off almost PG level, but don't let that fool you, because it will get to a level of violence almost like Mirai Nikki. I personally cherish this show as it takes all of the tropes and cliches of a Shonen anime and completely deconstructs them. The characters
                  don't always win, and when they do, it is not through pure strength, but also strategy. Each arc feels completely different from the last, while still tying the story together into one nice package. The story is incredible, the animation blows me away (especially with this series being 148 episodes), the incredible soundtrack is a bit repetitive at the beginning of the series but that changes, and I cannot recommend this series enough. This is easily the best anime I've ever watched.",10
"
                {---[Spoilers]---}
Hunter x Hunter is clearly one of the best shonen ever(with JoJo & Chainsawman), i used to watch it on tv sometimes when i was younger but it was in 2018 when I really started the anime and after finishing it i re-watched it the same year because its a fucking masterpiece.
Story :
Hunter x Hunter looks like a simple shonen when you see the synopsis but in reality it is completely different I will explain myself, first the story is not only focused on the main character, Gon is like any other character during the york new city arc the main character is Kurapika or
                  during the chimera ant arc its Meruem and Komugi, and with each arc the theme and the atmosphere of the anime changes in the first arc it was a series of trials in the second it was an adventure in search of someone the third was a tournament in the fourth it was a mafia movie the fifth was an isekai(best isekai imo) and the last one was an apocalyptic sf movie(the writing of this arc was so dark that HxH could have become a seinen).
Art :
Madhouse did a great job with animation and drawings, what is a pity is that Madhouse did not succeed in transcribing the same dark atmosphere that there was in the manga and in the 1999 version, but respect to them they managed to maintain the same good animation throughout the anime.
Sound :
Let's be clear HxH has one of the best soundtracks ever, Madhouse was able to place the Ost's well(my fav's are Riot, Requiem aranea & To give a Marionette life), the voice-actors fit really well with the characters, They did a great job.
Characters :
For me the characters are the biggest point of the anime they are so well written (Togashi is really good).
To start we will talk about Gon when we see him for the first time we will think that it will be a new Goku while he is totally different, he is a character who thinks only of himself he is neither nice nor bad he just does what he wants, if someone gets in his way he won't hesitate to kill him during the arc of chimera ant the character threw his humanity just to achieve his revenge, he is not evil as he is not good.
Now its Kurapika's turn he has a tragic past, he is one of the characters who suffered the most he chose to go alone to be able to fulfill his desire for revenge, his friends are his weakness he doesn't want to show them his real criminal nature.
And finally Meruem this character is a masterpiece, already his entry into the universe of HxH is incredible he is presented to us as the most powerful creature in the anime the biggest danger the earth has ever had, but he will change after his meeting with Komugi its evolution is really interesting when you compare it with that of Gon, Meruem discovers compassion and love while Gon discovers hate and murder one becomes human and the other becomes a monster and they never met wow, and finally remember the final fight of Meruem against Netero quote me a single antagonist of the shonen who will want to sit down and discuss instead of fighting.
There is also something that I find interesting in the characters of HxH, is that they are not necessarily good or bad they do what they want, except maybe Leorio who is really a good guy.
Conclusion :
Hunter x Hunter is life, Yeah.

                Hunter X Hunter has been hailed in recent times by many as the golden standard for Battle Shonen anime, or at least often treat as a respectable 2nd best in favour of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Whilst far better than its mangaka's previous work and executing many of the concepts which that series fell flat with halfway through fleshing them out (see my review for the Yu Yu Hakusho anime/manga for more understanding on what I mean), HxH still shows Togashi can be a bit sporadic in his writing.
To expand fully on the plot's quality, an in-depth exploration of each arc will be required. That said,
                  here is your spoiler warning for key plot and character events.
===Part 1: Pre-Yorknew events===
I will tie all the parts prior to Yorknew together as they each have comparable levels of quality. All of them have good premises, but their execution can be a little mixed for the most part. Starting off with the Hunter Exams, it is somewhat important to get a little tangential and compare it to an arc it inspired soon after - the Chunin Exams of Naruto. In a way, they have strengths where the other is weak and vice-versa. Whilst the Hunter Exams have a more interesting structure to its plot and more interesting characters, the Chunin Exams have more equalised character focus. As far as the Hunter Exams go, we're only given much reason to be invested in the main 4 and Hisoka and despite the threats they face, it's made apparent they are at far less risk than most of the competition. In comparison, things are a little more equalised in the Chunin Exams as the audience are given a lot of reasons to be invested in many of the competitors outside the main team such as Neji, Lee and Gaara.
Along with that, the world-building and tension provided by it are something Naruto had a slight advantage with. The Chunin Exams also served the purpose of showing how fragile the peace between each nation was and how the exam was what kept alliances between them. Meanwhile, the legal matters and world-building are a weakness for Hunter X Hunter due to what we'd later learn on Nen. It would be far more efficient for a Nen master to force the competitors to awaken their Nen and have those who succeeded go through the exam, rather than the opposite being so. Yes, this is technically a flaw of Heaven's Arena, but the end of the Hunter Exam already hinted at it with the mention of the ""True Hunter Exam"" and, thus, is worth speaking of hear. Whilst the story later establishes Netero as a flawed character who cares primarily for those with strong willpower and general strength, we are also later shown that he has a board with which to discuss decisions and that Pariston actively opposes many of his choices, so it is still somewhat perplexing that ammendments to the Exam's structure wouldn't have occurred soon after their establishment. Overall, I'd say the pros of character writing, putting in little hints of grey morality and narrative subversion (Netero enjoying beating Gon and Killua at an unfair game and the tournament bracket being flipped on its head respectively), it is still far from the perfect tournament arc (that title goes to the Zenith of Things Tournament from Battle Angel Alita: Last Order, but I digress).
Onto the Zoldyck Family, there is a lot less to say. Being introduced to the majority of Killua's family and seeing how dysfunctional and varied they all are was interesting, as was seeing how low in the world Gon and the rest were in power, though the anticlimactic ending can be seen as a bit unfulfilling.
As for Heaven's Arena, it is for the most part fine. The structure of the fights compared to the standard tournament was a breath of fresh air for Battle Shonen and somewhat similar to career matchs in boxing (and what I wish the Dark Tournament of YYH had been rather than the standard tournament we got). It is also nice to see the losses Gon takes that differentiate HxH from the standard Shonen. 
The biggest strength to the arc would be the introduction of Nen. In premise, it can be considered the greatest power system in Shonen with how it takes the necessity of training to make it feel earned from the likes of Ki in early Dragon Ball or Hamon from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, combined with the non-linear and strategic element to powers as JoJo's Stands. Later arcs would later hinder the execution with Contracts and the like that make its overall execution inferior to Alchemy from FMA, though we'll cross that bridge when we get there. For its introduction in this arc though, it was fantastic.
It can be considered a bit slow-paced, however, though other than that it was a fine arc.
Pre-Yorknew overall score - 6/10
===Part 2: Yorknew Arc===
This is where the series solidly establishes itself as more than the standard Battle Shonen. Along with a focus on strategic thought, an interesting identity with a mafia vs thief conflict and the grey morality of those involved, the Phantom Troupe are a definite stand out with how realistically they function as a character and group. They are purely after their own interests, yet also have just as great comradery amongst each other as the ""good guys"". You can see them somewhat as an improved version of the Juppongatana from Rurouni Kenshin and seeing them in action was always a highlight for the arc, along with the exploration of Kurapika's psychological state. Along with those positives, Kurapika being the main focus allows the conflict in this arc to be one with far more personal investment from its main cast and the atmosphere is great with elements such as the threat the Troupe pose to Gon, Killua and the rest as well as the intrigue going on such as Hisoka and Kurapika's dealings.
Still, it was far from flawless. Here is where we see Nen gain the convenience of most other Shonen power systems through Contracts. Whilst it's established how Contracts are double-edged swords with cruel side effects, the strengths Emperor Time provides in achieving his goal such as allowing him to take an attack from a supposed master Enhancer and use all types of Nen come off as overly convenient. This becomes an even greater problem when the Nen system is fleshed out further in the next arc that makes Uvogin's skill as an enhancer seem uncharacterisitcally amateurish (not to mention not using Gyo to deduce why Kurapika was able to perform so well), as well as Nobunaga's claims that Uvo would never been defeated.
A potentially great arc and still very good one, though the gaping problem of the Contract is damaging enough to just prevent it from being a top tier Shonen arc.
7.5/10
===Part 3: Greed Island Arc===
This arc is probably the most standard of a Battle Shonen in the series, having a simple structure of adventure, training and defeating the final boss after having gotten stronger. In execution, it accomplishes these elements well, particularly the training and the payoffs of the dodgeball game and Genthru fight, but there are some major problems within it.
These mainly lie in how Nen is used in this arc. We learn much of how advanced Nen works and in doing so, it damages several elements of the previous arcs. For instance, with what advanced techniques are revealed, it would seem Uvogin's Big Bang Impact was in retrospect little more than an overhyped Ko. Along with that, the reveal of Greed Island being within the real world and how the game was created by Ging and his friends would make it apparent this group should be able to use the card abilities as Nen if they were created out of their Nen. That said, it's loosely revealed Nen users can learn abilities to restore destroyed limbs, teleport others away and many others, which would seem a bit inconsistent with what we've been shown thus far in the limited abilities one can learn. Logically, it makes little sense how a handful of Nen Masters can create so many convenient abilities, even if for limited usage. These cards also act as major plot convenience to limit the consequences of this arc. For instance, Gon losing an arm would seem intense in the moment, but pointless when everything returns to normal when it's restored.
Another flaw to the arc would be its villains. Coming right off the trail of the brilliantly written Phantom Troupe, Genthru and his team being a generic group of overly evil gamers are absolutely mediocre.
That said, whilst Greed Island had a lot of competency in its general structure, the damages of how Nen is handled and the writing of its villains outweigh them.
4/10
===Part 4: Chimera Ant Arc===
Here is where the series peaks. With the premise and execution of the Chimera Ants as a species, the series starts to explore many elements of human nature such as the conflicting necessities of individuality and communities or the varied morality of humanity. Along with that, the stakes are raised further than ever before in the series, as several established characters are killed and the Ants threaten the world as a whole. Along with that, we have some excellent character development and introspection in the writing of the likes of the subversion of Shoot and Knov in their introduction compared to their true nature, the Royal Guards embodying different aspects deemed necessary of human development and best of all, Meruem's arc making him one of the most well written villains in the medium with his parallels to Gon and the well paced development as he transitions further from his Ant nature to that of his humanity as the two sides struggle against the other.
It does have a few elements that prevent it from being the perfect story arc, however. The first to be made apparent is the minor matter of powerscaling. The dodgeball match in the Greed Island Arc would suggest Gon had gained Nen strength on par with Hisoka, yet the events of the arc would make it apparent that it's not until after his training in this arc that he reached the same level as most Troupe members based on how he fared against lower level Ants. 
The major problem with the arc though is lacking foreshadowing in some areas, the first being Illumi's needle. The reveal of it causes the majority of Killua's decisions in this arc to be artificial when his fear was purely due to Illumi mind controlling him, though his breaking of the conditioning and removing it at least don't make Killua completely without agency. There's then the Rose Bomb being contrived when lacking any foreshadowing despite enough room for it, as was Gon's contract transformation. Adult Gon was still in the realm of possibility with him being told about contracts from Kurapika, but the lack of time shown in him doing any sort of training towards it causes his power up to come out of nowhere; a shame when the concept of a dark, brutal and consequential power up was amazing. Also, Meruem's amnesia was the one damaging element of his arc, existing only to extend it.
As for the commonly referenced problems of pacing and infodumps, I wouldn't say the former was an issue when it makes the most of each event and making things more fast-paced would only damage the writing. As for the infodumps, they were a mixed bags. For the most part, they were preferable to slowing the arc's pacing further, though some come off as highly unnecessary such as ""Knuckle was scared.""
Still, those flaws only hold back this arc from being perfect and what we received was still an excellent story that was for the most part the peak of Togashi's writing.
8/10
===Part 5: Election Arc===
Following the peak of the series, we have the lowest point of it in which the series jumped the shark. The premise of addressing the flaws of Netero's leadership was good and the elections showed the commonly overlooked aspect of politics in Shonen fantasy, plus seeing Hisoka and Illumi actively combat Killua and the law was nice, but the arc is single-handedly ruined by one element - Alluka. Along with having no foreshadowing for his existence in the manga (though thankfully, the anime fixed this element), all the interesting factors in his wish granting are made irrelevant with the reveal that his love for Killua causes his big brother to screw the rules, thus making all the time spent on fleshing out the wish granting ability pointless when all it takes is Killua making the wish for Alluka to become the Dragon Balls on speed dial. At least things weren't completely without consequences as Gon's Nen wasn't restored, but we never see how that affects him personally beyond not being able to visit the Dark Continent and is still pretty lacking when considering how much torture his body went through as a result of his transformation.
On the subject of pointlessness, the election amounted to nothing. Pariston wins only to troll everyone and resign, making the whole election just glorified filler to allow for something to occur outside of the Alluka storyline.
Whilst having some elements of good, the core parts of this arc were absolutely terrible and caused some major damage to the series.
1.5/10
To summarise the story's quality, it features excellent world building, a well thought out (though still flawed) power system and each arc helps show a unique identity that shows great insight into Togashi's thoughts on life and his interests. That works as a double-edged sword, however, as the drastic shifts from one arc to the next cause many aspects to feel uneven in both tone and quality.
===Story outline/analysis ends here===
Moving on to characters, this is where the series' greatest strength lies. The series contains some of the most well-developed or fleshed out characters in the medium with each playing their role in the story well and the chemistry between each one showing a lot of individuality and personality. Beyond some of the minor characters being fairly lacking in comparison to the main cast (though even most of the minor villains present more character development than the entire casts of some Shonen), the worst they have are a few mediocrities in its large cast (and Alluka being terrible).
As for the more superficial elements of art, animation and sound, this where Madhouse pull their weight. An excellent job is done in enhancing the uneven quality of the manga's art to consistent high quality with excellent animation for the most part, save a few long range shots in less important scenes. The voice acting is flawless and the sountrack has some amazing pieces, though the sountrack is a little lacking for the Hunter Exams due to the constant repetition of several tracks.
To conclude, how does Hunter X Hunter rank compared to other Battle Shonen? It's certainly far better than the vast majority of the mainstream and has peaks beyond that of perhaps any other of the Shonen demographic's sub-genre. Despite that, it fails in being as coherent or consistent with its in-universe laws and arc quality as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. It also doesn't have as consistent quality as Hokuto no Ken (the first HnK anime and pre-timeskip manga, that is) or the coherent focus of Ruroun Kenshin, which ranks it below both of them. Still, being the 4th best Battle Shonen (or fifth best Shonen in general, Ashita no Joe being #1 of the demographic) is still quite an achievement and the series features many elements those looking to find something different than the typical Shonen can enjoy, as can those looking for a template on creating an excellent fantasy action series.
Overall ranking - 7/10",7

— Ging Freecss
Starting off this review with my favorite anime quote out there. Hunter x Hunter (2011) gained more popularity over the past years, for sure, but it's still not even close to popular enough in my eyes. I watched this show first at the end of 2014, practically some months after it finished airing and people were writing first complete reviews. Before that, i never really wanted to start watch HxH because of it's childish artstyle, which i mainly got from the cover
                  image. A HUGE mistake by me. I regret it to this day. But oh well. As mentioned, i first watched HxH 2011 at the end of 2014 and it actually lasted about 10 days until i finished it. I was SO hooked up into it, i couldn't stop. It was during my holidays and i just filled my whole schedule with HxH 2011, sleeping and eating. That was all. - /social contacts off. It was just the best experience i got from any anime to this day, and that by far. I don't even know where to start, this show is just amazing in any way.
Let's start with what the review's ratings start with: Story
It really is just another shounen-ganbatte story with a huge cast, AT FIRST GLANCE. Only the introduction arc alone was so freaking intense and interesting, that you had to go on with it. It all starts pretty childish and you keep thinking, that it might not be for you at all, because your thoughts were confirmed. But NO. It keeps delivering on and on and just changes your mind just as quickly as the first arc ends. And from there on, it's just insanely original. Many story arcs follow, with many loveable and badass anti-heroes, jesus mthfkn christ good art and animation and the most loveable main character cast there is. There is just nothing wrong here with Art, Sound and Characters. The Story really is pretty nice, but to sum it up: the base idea is just the same as in any other shounen-ganbatte. So i only give this a 9/10 instead of a 10/10. Basically the only critic point. But i don't even know how it would have gotten the 10/10. I LOVE typical shounen anime which are good made. And this is definitely made PERFECTLY.
As you can tell the Enjoyment of this show for me was over the top. I ate this show in 10 days like nothing. It was insane. I don't have this with many other shows, and defnitely not as much as i had it with HxH 2011. I rewatched the whole story with a friend of mine at the end of 2015, just to show her the greatness of what HxH 2011 is, and ever since she is in love with some two certain characters of the final arc. I think that every person, who gives this show a chance and doesn't truly hate shounen anime, will straight up love this anime. And i can't think of a possibility to give this a lower rating than 8. It's just plain not honest.
Finally, a liltte TL;DR and sum up for people who consider watching this but are not sure yet. If you like fights with real good animations, loveable and badass characters, a nice told and paced story, epic character development and on point soundtrack - give this show a shot and at least watch 20 episodes, before you consider dropping it.
Cheers ~",10

                Hunter x Hunter manages to maintain an impressive quality over 148 episodes, this is quite the accomplishment.
This anime may satisfy a somewhat broad audience (29yo in my case), because it evolves into many different styles and atmospheres across the acrs, and is rich in many ways, the characters behavior make sense (it is such a rare thing), don't let bright colors fool you, it does get dark and bloody at times, heads roll.
The characters are well-constructed, devellopped, deep, interesting, and colorful. The world is rich, in terms of places, characters, creatures, items, mysteries, abilities, rules. The sense of danger and tension is made very palpable,
                  particularly in the second half. The story is compelling, you are almost never fed with meaningless information/scenes, wich is usually such an irritating characteristic in shows/animes in general. There is always something to look forward to.
It starts on an adventure note, Gon Freecss leaves the Whale Island to become a Hunter, with one goal in mind: find his father, a mysterious Hunter. It's an amazing adventure, growing darker, where Gon will stumble many many times.
The story is made of 7 arcs, of very different length and tones. The first arc illustrates the hunter examination. It managed to hook me just a little quite easily because you follow the candidates perspective and the trials and characters are mysterious and tricky, and it's more about tricks than fights. The second arc is the weakest arc story-wise, but I would not recommend skipping anything as fights starts to get interesting and you learn about the ground rules of the fights, the climax point of this arc was however vey very satisfying. The following arcs gets more and more serious as they progress, and more importantly switch entirely in tones and genras.
Utimatly you reach the 6th arc (Chimera Ants) wich contains 60 episode, on a 148 episode anime, something huge is at work, with a 34 episode-long epic climax (111 to 135). The magic happend for me, it was simply amazing, I was completly overexcited episode after episode after episode.
Hunter x Hunter is clever, beautiful, intense and dense.
I wrote this review while I just rushed it in a very unhealthy amount of time (a few days), I had never seen it before, and I am sad. I am sad because I won't get to re-experienced it for the first time ever again, and it left me with this feeling that every anime I have yet to watch is very poor in comparison.
Needless to say, this was my favorite anime among my slightly above average anime experience (~30).",10

                Hunter x Hunter has been in my life for a while. I read the manga as a child in Korea, and I kept up with it after I moved to the US. Yet, I would describe its presence in my life as sparse and skimpy. For one, I was too young to understand the complex world of Hunter x Hunter; furthermore, the frequent hiatuses interrupted any sense of continuity or significance. Therefore, even though I was aware of many of the major events in the plot, I wouldn't say I really knew what the show was about. You might ask then, what made you watch
                  the show? Well, there's a very simple answer: YouTube! I follow a few popular YouTube channels that analyze and criticize anime; and all of them recommended Hunter x Hunter (2011). I had been craving a new show to watch, so I took their advice and dove into the wonderful world of Hunter x Hunter.
YouTube told me I would be impressed by these things: 1) Killua and Gon's friendship 2) the adventure and 3) the animation and the action scenes. In this review, let's begin with these things and see if my experience of the show lived up to the authoritative advice of my favorite YouTubers. So let's get to the first question: What's special about Gon and Killua's relationship? Isn't it common for shonen mangas to mess up rivalries and friendships? Yes it is. Look at Naruto and Bleach. However, Hunter x Hunter is fundamentally different from Naruto and Bleach. Unlike Naruto and Bleach, Hunter x Hunter is not a typical shonen manga. It does not have an invincible protagonist defeating every enemy. For instance, Gon, the main character, never really wins. He lost to Hisoka during the Hunter Exam and he lost to him again during the Heaven's arena arc. But, for some reason Hunter x Hunter makes those losses epic and awesome. How? Well, the focus is not so much on victory but rather on character development. This makes it so that even though Gon lost we were exhilarated to see his vast improvement as a fighter. 
Moreover, Hunter x Hunter’s characters do not partake in shallow relationships that feel contrived. Killua's bond with Gon feels organic. Gon was Killua's first friend, he has a bright and bubbly personality, and he rescued Killua from a life by which he felt trapped. We also see them go through so many trials and tribulations together –and also joy as they make jokes and goof around– that the gradual strengthening of their trust and love feels very natural. It makes sense as to why Killua cares about Gon. Not only does the relationship feel organic, it is also very personal to the viewers. The show takes a lot of time into probing into Killua's psychology and how he feels towards Gon. We see how much he cares about Gon and how much he tries to be a better friend for Gon. Such frequent exposure to his psychology makes us care about him and his relationship with Gon. Since it invests so much time into their relationship, we become invested in their relationship as well.
On top of such solid rapport between the protagonists, we have the fascinating villains of Hunter x Hunter. These characters are so complex, funny, compelling, and unique that it’s honestly inappropriate to call them villains. Most of these are just characters who lead their own lives, with their own unique goals, who happen to cross paths with the main characters. Sure, none of these are upstanding models of good moral conduct, but they are not your typical villain who just “wants to see the world burn.” They have friendships, bonds, goals, and attachments that make their every move interesting and relatable. No wonder some of the most popular characters are villains –Hisoka, the Spiders, and Meruem. 
So far it appears that my favorite YouTubers were correct: the characters’ relationships are indeed compelling and interesting. Could we say the same about its world –the place in which the adventure takes place? My answer again is yes. The world of Hunter x Hunter is complex and mysterious. For instance, Nen, the energy that allows the characters perform inhuman tasks, is very complicated. It’s not a simple system like the ki of Dragonball whose only feature is that those who have more ki are stronger. Unlike ki, Nen isn’t a system in which you simply climb up the ladder to become stronger. The system is set up in a way so that there are many different types of Nen users. Their types and abilities are determined by their personalities. These abilities are often not about overt strength, i.e., it’s not always about battle. To be fair, there are a lot of battles in Hunter x Hunter. But these battles are not about overpowering your opponent through brute strength or speed. It is more about using your unique ability to the fullest. This is quite apparent in the fight between Uvogin and Kurapika; it ain’t always about muscle. Lurking in the background of this complicated Nen system is the world of Hunter x Hunter itself. This is a world full of properties, institutions, assassins, games, bandits, and creatures that are so disparate and creative that it is nigh impossible to explain all of them in this review. I think the best way to somewhat grasp the enormity of this world is to look back at my list – “properties, institutions, assassins, games, bandits, and creatures.” Unlike a typical shonen manga that revolves around beating the Big Bad, Hunter x Hunter lets you take a peak at their political institutions, the kinds of games they play, and so on. This is further amplified by the nearly endless amount of details that turns everything in this whacky world into a coherent network. 
Last but not least, the animation is superb. Coming from Madhouse, which gave us One Punch Man, Wolf Children, and Death Note, one can only imagine the quality of the animation. I was and I am still surprised by the quality of the animations for a show that spans over a hundred episodes. How is this possible? I am not so sure. But perhaps the long list of Korean animators might give us a clue as to how many people were involved in producing this masterpiece of show. I highly recommend it.",10

                Story:
Just like the old old Hunter x Hunter this remake is a must see for all the big fans out there. Some of the less intressting parts have been cut off from the main plot but they also added some nice details which makes watching it also more intressting for people who are entirely new to the concept of Hunter x Hunter. The only thing that I personally thought a little bit less off was the fact of the early character introductions in the series. They should have made 1 or 2 extra episodes for that, but overall it is a  story / action
                  well balanced series you will enjoy watching with lovely battle strategics.
Art:
Well i'll just desrcribe it like this. it's fantastic and wonderfull arty! You might think all those action scenes would be tiresome for your eyes but in this case it isn't. The camera focus is right on spot and they leave some space in between the action scenes.
Sound:
Overall the music is good, sometimes I just wondered why they used certain tracks at times where there should have been playing a more serious music track, but it might be just me not understanding the humor behind  it.
Character:
The charcters start of with certain trades which they will develop over time like in any good shounen action series. I absolutely loved the idea of giving certain characters abilities which lean towards things they have been through / have done. Also I didn't have certain generic character feeling when I was watching the whole series. They all have trademarks, points of intrests, I even thought some of the minor characters had intressting backstories which stayed a mystery for you to fill in.
Enjoyment:
Yeah I certainly didn't bore myself any minute watching it, the mix between action / plot / drama is just great.
Overall:
Just watch it ...... it's freaking great!!",10

                It goes to show that you truly cannot judge a show by looks alone. Upon first glance at the profile picture, I assumed Hunter x Hunter (2011) was too goofy for my taste. My curiosity finally peaked when the show’s conclusion was announced in 2014. Watching HxH was an adventure itself, and I still regard it as one of the best (if not, THE best) battle shounen in existence. There are nonexistent fillers, individuality among the characters, and an excellent separation between comedy and gravity. 
In the beginning, HxH appears as a kids show with a 12-year-old protagonist with the goal of becoming a hunter
                  and meeting friends along the way. However, as it progresses, it becomes more active, mature, and sinister, especially in the Chimera Ant (episodes 76-136) and Phantom Troupe (episodes 37-58) arcs. Those two are my favorite arcs (in that order) because of the storyline, character development, gore, and action. There are no fillers, only two recap episodes in the beginning (episodes 13 and 26). If you skip those two episodes, you’re not missing out on anything, unless you want to just breeze through those. Drama is involved throughout the series to establish relationships and connections between characters. The pacing was well-executed, showing the protagonists’ objectives and the improvement of their powers and strengths instead of just making them into copy-paste characters who are completely invincible. It executes comedy and seriousness very well. There is no playing around during battles and wasting time. There are two things that bothered me with the story. There was this insane power up in the Chimera Ant arc that I found to be your typical generic shounen trope. Although the primary goal was reached, the ending was incomplete in some parts. Some drama was stirring up in some parts of the world, and the anime doesn't investigate it further. However, I'm glad they decided to end the series instead of having a bunch of fillers until the mangaka decides to quit hiatus.
Yoshihiro Togashi, the creator of HxH, created an excellent story with one of the best forms of character development I’ve ever seen. It is really impressive. Despite being the main character, the show did not make Gon to be more superior than the others. Every person has a common goal, and the show gives the main cast their own screentime. Each has a special past that consists of them being accustomed to certain attacks, diseases or develop a major ability that helps them along the way. The protagonists are not always superior either. They’re human. They lose battles, but they make comebacks and become stronger than ever. You watch the characters experience trial-and-error and deal with frustration and pain. As heartbreaking or exciting as it may seem, some of your favorite characters will die. Even the villains show realistic emotions that made me feel sorry for them in their final moments.
The background design is very artistic and bright. The choreography in the fights are engaging. The painted still images are amazing and highlights the characters' main features well. There are thrilling scenes with dead bodies and dismantled body parts. The character designs were unique and distinguishable. The fanservice is a nice addition (especially Hisoka), and it wasn’t thrown out there in the wrong moments. 
The seiyuu are very talented. I love that females played the voice of Gon, Killua, and Kurapika. I fell in love with the theme song, which has different versions throughout the show. I love the majority of the ED, especially “HUNTING FOR YOUR DREAM” by Galneryus and “Nagareboshi Kirari” by YUZU. One consistent thing that really annoyed me throughout the Greed Island arc (episodes 59-75) is the use of music for a particular scene. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a death, an aftermath of a massacre, or a sad memory, they always seem to play a score that reminds me of a cheerful video game. However, after I rewatched the series, I hardly noticed it. 
I was hesitant to watch HxH at first, because the only experience with battle shounen I had was Bleach at the time. Bleach was a horrible experience with common shounen tropes. I decided to give it a chance, and HxH is a fun experience. If you haven’t seen it yet, I highly recommend it. As you read above, this show has many strengths that separates it from other battle shounen. HxH became one of my favorite shows because of the points I mentioned previously. The character development and the maturity of HxH have to be the highlights of the show for me. Because of the incomplete ending, I would recommend reading the manga. However, it appears that the manga ended where the anime left off. Yoshihiro has been on hiatus for awhile, so there’s no helping that. Anyway, don't miss out on this great opportunity. Give Hunter x Hunter (2011) a shot.",9

                This anime is a masterpiece! The Story and the arc are all fantastic, the plot is so good it will draw anyone in. The characters are all good, i dont hate a single character in this anime, exept some small ones. Gon and Killua are great main characters along with Kurapika and Leorio, they are always so fun to watch and always shine when they are on the screen, the animation is really good, but its madhouse so its expected lol.  The music is also very good and adds tention and emotion. The fighting scenes are some of the best i have seen in
                  any anime, they are intense, fast, and fun. The show is also very deppresing at times, like the 4th arc, so dont expect a fully happy anime, it has some gory moments but its your average shounen anime violence, its more some plot points and scenes that are disturbing, not the violence itself, or that is how i think, overall i would reccomend this anime to EVERYONE! Did i mention that the openings and endings are all gooooood. But plz, watch this amazing anime! 10/10 NO QUESTIONS ASKED.",10
"
                This anime was ridiculously such an amazing emotional ride that I will never ever forget & will remain as one of my favorites. How well written each arc was, the whole storyline/plot, the OST & OP I NEVER once skipped singing to, the strong emo connections I’ve had with almost every character & the variety of lessons anyone can learn from it, I strongly recommend everyone to watch it if you haven’t because it’s beyond remarkable.
Honestly, in the beginning, I’ve never thought that I was going to be so attached to such an anime & I mostly was bored during the first few seasons, especially
                  with knowing that there were literally 148 episodes. I was also pretty much a newbie in anime & I haven’t watched much shounen, So it took me a while to even start binge-watching it a lot until I reached the Greed Island arc where things started getting damn interesting for me.
Literally, it got even better when I reached the Chimera Ant Arc as everything started to get darker while the fight scenes & the plot were extraordinary. 
I’m not going to go much in detail about what I absolutely loved about each and every arc, but I can say that one of the things that impressed me the most was how well written the Chimera Ant Arc was. I’ve read lots of reviews with people talking about how long it took, especially with the whole palace invasion taking dozens of episodes to complete. I honestly can’t go against that as it took me around 3-4 days of binge-watching with around 20 episodes everyday LOL 
However, in my opinion, it was so worth it. The way every problem & every strategy used was explained during each and every fight, was so well done with detail and made me understand the plot much better.
Anyway, with my depressed self here who still can’t get over this anime & isn’t willing to explain much, 
the #1 thing I can never ever forget about it is the emotional connection I’ve had with every character. The main protagonists & even the villains with the phantom troupe and the chimera ants, I found it hard for myself to really hate any one of them because every single character was fantastic to me. (Except shaiapouf. literally. idk how many times I wanted to explode in irritation bc of him but yes HAHA)
[SPOILERS TO EP 145]
Not to mention that I absolutely sobbed like hell with Gon & Leorio running to each other and embracing themselves. The power of friendship represented in HXH was very impactful. It even occurred with the villains: Pakunoda having to make such a sacrifice for the troupe & how much she cared for Chrollo, and for the Chimera Ants it was for some of them who retrieved their old memories & remembered their last friendships with one another (EG: Bloster & Welfin) 
Not forgetting the whole deep connection that Meruem and Komugi had too which brought me to tears (honestly I would’ve considered it as a love-related connection instead of a friendship-wise one because really it felt more strong, my heart hurts for them) 
Of course, with the one and only duo which everyone has to love & which truly brought me to tears, Killua & Gon.
[SPOILERS TO EP 147]
Killua & Gon parting ways absolutely killed me. As they turned around with fake smiles on their faces after saying goodbye, they immediately felt the pain of what it was like to separate from each other after being together for so long. What really made me burst into tears more was because of how I have a best friend who migrated miles away from me & that scene alone, just reminded me of that one day I had to say goodbye to my own best friend. I remember suffocating in my own tears as I hugged her goodbye & it really had to remind me of it. It’s the one and only thing I haven’t moved on from & seeing that scene, I was even able to relate to my favorite anime. My heart hurts so much for this ending & I can’t help but express how much I will miss the two. Gon’s determination, positivity and appreciation, Killua’s protectiveness, care, and connection, the two are ultimately the best duo. The montage that was played during the credits scene with their memories, and with ED 4 playing at the background literally made me flood my whole house LOL. There’s a lot to learn from HXH & mainly I can say that the importance of friendship is definitely one of them & I just wish that they could reunite sometime soon because both Killua and Gon‘s friendship is probably one of the best ones I’ve ever seen in ANY anime.
I know that I have so much more reasons of why I love this anime tho I can’t fully explain them anymore due to the lack of energy, I have not stopped crying HAHA
BUT I will definitely give this a 10/10 rating because it is indeed a MASTERPIECE & I can’t help but read the manga now due to how I just want to experience the whole story all over again (I might even rewatch the anime)
It will forever remain as one of my favorites, and I really need y’all to watch this ASAP if you haven’t, you’re missing out :P",10

                This is everything. Despite a buildup of a huge fight happening- it’s usually anticlimatic. The anime always chooses to take the more creative and artsy route, giving it that much more impact. Our main characters fail more often than they succeed. That’s right. Characters. Plural. Not only are the characters and story smart, they are consistently so! All the story arcs carry a different tone but the transitions into each is incredibly smooth. Generally, the story gets more mature and darker. The antagonist is the love of my life- next to L from Death Note. You will love him too, I swear. Get ready to
                  feel a black hole where your heart should be after 148 episodes!",9
"
                I think Killua changed his personality from the first season to this re-make. He is now more friendly and accommodating. Whether that is bad or good is up to you. The overall feel of the anime up to the Greed Island Arc is good. Oerall, it was a bit confusing on how several elements have come together: magic, aliens, etc. The Chimera Ant Arc was just too slow. I think they focused too much on it, adding more characters that would be scrapped in the end. There were several series of episodes on the arc where the main characters were not shown at all. And
                  then the concluding arc was too rushed. Did Gon and Killua ever meet again? What happened to Hisoka? To Leorio. And then that anticlimactic part of Gon meeting his father. I thought if episodes were sacrificed on the chimera ant arc for the ending it would have been better. 
I really liked the ant king though. But that was also a bit anticlimactic. Also, he looked like Freeza from Dragon Ball. He needs some originality. Another thing that I liked about this anime and the only thing that pushed me to the end is Killua's feelings for Gon. So whe I saw the ending, I was really disappointed that his feelings were not given justice.",6
"
                So, I started Hunterxhunter because of so many people recommending it to me. Now I’m only just on episode 77 so my opinion might change as I continue watching the show but, while I was looking through the reviews I saw how a lot of people were saying the show is terrible and stuff so I wanted to write my own opinion too.
So we start of with our main protagonist, Gon. He was just like an other anime protagonist I had seen, a very kind and caring person. To be honest, I didn’t have a problem with that at all but I did kind of
                  feel disappointed about that. The first episode was pretty wholesome and cute in my opinion. Since I don’t mind what genre of anime I watch I was fine with the first episode being “boring”. We also see that Gon also doesn’t have a father figure just like any other anime protagonist. So in my opinion, I’d say Gon’s personality and character were pretty basic.
Soon, in the Hunter exam arc, we meet some of the main supporting characters. We have Kurapika, the one character that wants revenge and Leorio, a character that wants money. I personally thought Kurapika’s goal in this series is worthy of being a main character’s goal. So I’d say he is a pretty cool character, nothing new though. (Not that I have a problem with that.) Leorio on the other hand, at first I thought he was a okay character considering his goal was pretty basic but when we got a little shred of his backstory it made me think of him in a different way. Still, I’d say he’s also a pretty basic character.
Later on, we met Killua. Now, I absolutely loved Killua from the start but the strength they gave him was indeed very unrealistic. It’s a literal 12 year old with the strength of a man. Also, the fact that he had been training his whole lifetime only brought a little bit of sense to it. I personally think that they shouldn’t have made Killua as powerful in brute force but maybe excellent in being able to lurk in the shadows quietly and perfectly. They should’ve given him a bit more assassin traits then just showing us that he’s powerful.
Next, we have the arcs. I saw a few people saying that the Greed Island arc was completely useless but I think the main reason it was made was so Ging could know if Gon was strong enough for him to met him as he didn’t want to meet Gon if he was weak apparently. 
Also, the Zoldyck family arc was pretty cool but it was boring at the same time. They should’ve given us more depth about Killua’s family and stuff. It was really just taking Killua and leaving. We didn’t even get any backstories. I was really disappointed. 
The Heavens Arena arc was also for making the main characters stronger and to give us an introduction to this new thing that hunters use called ‘Nen’. It was pretty slow and the fights were worse then I had expected. But, it didn’t bother me as much.
The Yorknew arc was probably the best arc in the anime, the fight against Kurapika and Uvoigon was pretty cool. I also liked how Kurapika got some character development too. 
I still haven’t gotten to the Chimera Ants arc so I don’t exactly have anything to say to it.
Overall, this anime was written out pretty badly and the characters were written bad too. The fights were cool and there were really fun times in the anime too. I’d say this anime is pretty slow, and it’s basically like any other shounen anime out there. If you have problems with a show being very slow and their being no logic at some parts also having very unrealistic characters, this anime is definitely not for you. But like I said before, I don’t mind any of that. I’m actually enjoying hunterxhunter a lot so far and I got attached to the characters pretty easily. In my opinion, I like this anime even if it lacks a lot of things.",7
"
                Hunter x Hunter is one of the greatest animes I`ve ever watched. It was flawless and definitely deserves I write down my thoughts and feelings about it.  I´m writing this review mostly for myself, but if you stumble across it and find it helpful then that´s great. 
Among all the things I consider to label an anime as amazing and a must watch, character development is definitely one of the most important. We see that in HxH.
1. Killua: my favorite character, and it´s all thank to his development throughout the series, his journey about friendship and personal growth is remarkable. He earned the spot
                  of favorite in episode 94 Friends x and x Journey, when he is fighting Shoot, if you've seen the series you know what I'm talking about.  
2. Gon: he is also an incredible character, so naive, so loyal, so brave, so smart, so honest. It was a breath of fresh air. I learned so much from him, his loyalty to his friends and his convictions make him a very likeable character. He has his flaws, he is impulsive, reckless and stubborn but he behaved that way because he loved and wanted to help his friends, so I let it slide most of the time. It is part of who he is.
Kurapika is another interesting character, but I will refrain from disscussing him because I haven't read the manga yet (so there may be more to the story) and I dont want people to have a biased opinion about him based on my review.
There are many amazing characters I wish to disscuss but then this would be too long.
About the story, I'll go arc by arc:
Hunter exam: 10/10
Some people say HxH starts slow, but I have to disagree a bit, it may have been a little slow the first couple of episodes, but I think it was actually a good thing, it set a nice pace for what was coming and makes sure you understand more about Gon and the world he lives in. 
I thought this arc was brilliant, I learned so much from it, it was well written and well thought of. The use of strategy, intelligence, endurance and friendship was key here. 
Zoldyck family: 10/10
brief but amazing, I would also love to see more of this family, their back stories and what they have accomplished as assassins.
Heaven's arena: 10/10
You see the progress and development the characters endure very clearly in this arc. I enjoyed the fighting. Something I like about this series is that it's not just mindless fighting, there are actually some great strategies and thinking behind every fight in this series. 
Yorknew arc: 10/10 my favorite arc
HxH has many diffrent moods and settings to each arc, this arc was a little darker, it was amazing. I loved the Phantom Troupe, i wish there was a spinoff or more arcs about them. They were amazing fighters with interesting abilities. Also I found mesmerizing the way they behaved among themselves, the way they cared about one another. I wish I could have seen more, and gotten to know them better and their back stories. Feitan was my favorite member.
Greed Island arc 10/10 
This arc is very adventurous and enjoyable, it's also a key arc regarding the main characters growth and strenghts. I'll say no more in order to not  spoil anything.
Up till this point I couldn't stop watching, didn't want to ever stop, it was a solid 10 up to this next arc. The next arc is the reason it got an overall 9
Chimera ant arc: 7/10
This arc was a long one, it had an interesting story, but I felt it was paced all wrong. It started way to slow and the build ups were very brief. Don't get me wrong, there were incredible 10 rated episodes for me here, but they were surrounded by some not so good episodes and I felt the pacing made the arc drag a little and it lost it's light adventure, smart thing it had going on. I think the arcs was incredibly well thought, and the ending was unbelievable, it was really good. But it didn't portrayed in a way that I much liked, which makes it a 7 and not a 10.
13th hunter chairman election: 9/10
it started and ended so fast! In the last arc of the anime there  are a couple of slw episodes but the last ones made everything worth it. That last episode was amazing, I even wrote down the last quote, so I can read it every day. It definetely touched my heart.
Overall 9/10 
The chimera ant made it a 9 and not a 10, but it is more like a 9.4 than a 9.
Definitely watch this series, you will not regret it, if you are into adventure, action, shounen animes with a well thought, smart and analitical sense to it, watch HxH. Don't let the sinopsis fool you. Also the use of nen and auras, was incredible, and made it so much fun to watch, there is so much diversity, creativity and imagination, and we only discovered a small part of it all.",9

                Hunter x Hunter is one of my favourite anime of all time. I liked every single episode and it was never boring to watch it. The story is always progressing and there are no filler episodes, only some recap episodes.
The characters in this anime are just fantastic, even villains and ""evil"" characters are so well made that you often sympathize with them. The bond and friendship between the two main characters, Gon and Killua, are so beautifully made. It's really amazing to see these two characters grow and develop during the show.
This anime has many emotional moments that just really hit your feelings, especially during
                  the chimera ant arc, which is my favourite arc in the show.
I have nothing negative to say about Hunter x Hunter, I just truly think it's a masterpiece and I loved every minute of watching it.",10

                --- INCLUDES MILD & MODERATE SPOILERS ---
        --- READ AT YOUR OWN RISK ---
Hunter X Hunter is the best Shonen anime in the world, and also one of the most underrated, as in literally under-rated. This deserves to be rated higher, and I'm pretty sure that the only reason it isn't is because it ended halfway, both the anime and the manga, due to the writer's chronic back pain. It's the most, ""by-the-books"" anime you'll ever watch, and it may also make you cry. Not once does it stray off-track from its Shonen category. The main character's focus
                  is always on getting stronger, improving and defeating his foes. I won't compare it to other animes since that would be unfair to the review of an individual anime. I'll just get right into it.
Gon takes the Hunter exam to become a Hunter like his father and finds amazingly written characters as his friends, namely Killua, Kurapika and Leorio. There are also other interesting characters, Hisoka and Gittarackurr (Illumi). Every single one of them are likeable in their own ways, although I can't say much about the latter two, Hisoka and Illumi, I assure you that every one of the main and supporting characters have their own long-term goals regardless of how small or big their role is, spanning through all of the arcs. The main character, however, isn't JUST Gon. The main character changes every arc, sometimes even every few episodes, and that's another of the most refreshing things about Hunter X Hunter.
The character development of this show is notable. Killua and Gon's growth and progress throughout the series is ridiculously incredible. Oh, boy. If you thought Gon's development during the Heaven's Arena arc was insane, just you wait until the Greed Island and Chimera Ant arcs. And I won't spoil it, but Gon's not always gonna remain the cheerful and enthusiastic kid, for a while, at least. 
The introduction was Nen abilities during the Heaven's Arena arc was a surprise to me as I didn't take it as a superpower fiction anime, rather just a Shonen fiction, but needless to say; it definitely improved the standard of the anime and they dragged that concept until the very end, polishing it beautifully and fixing the plotholes.
My favorite thing about Hunter X Hunter is the logic in the series. Namely, the abilities. Nen isn't an overexaggerated, overpowered superpower ability that destroys the entire world in one go (not pointing any fingers). Rather, it's the awakening, manifestation and manipulation of one's own ""life energy"", dubbed as aura in the series. The concept of Nen isn't actually that farfetched from the life energy of an actual human being, although the techniques may be. Also the introduction of phagogenesis during the Chimera Ant arc, the form of reproduction of the Chimera Ant Queen. The Queen can self-reproduce by consuming other organisms. When an organism is consumed, the next offspring of the phagogenetic creature will contain the genes of the consumed organism. It's such an incredible concept that I knew it would be my favorite anime the second it was elaborated. You can just tell how much research and depth went into the idea and recreation of this singular subject, not even the entire arc. This is what made me fall in love with the anime.
Now, let's talk about things that's NOT the story. The artstyle, soundtracks and voice acting of the anime are also gorgeous, although some say that the art doesn't live up to expectations. But that's not what I look for in an anime, so I wouldn't know. The opening is the same throughout the series but the outros keep changing, and God, every one of them was beautiful and pleasant to the ears, especially ""Hyori Ittai"", or ""Two Sides of the Same Coin"", Ending 5. Definitely makes my Top 10 Best Anime Endings list.
All in all, that concludes my summary and analysis on why Hunter X Hunter is the living legend that it is and takes the rightful spot of the best Shonen anime in the existence of Shonen animes. I would rate it 11/10 if I could.
TL;DR, Hunter X Hunter is the best Shonen anime you'll ever watch, as it not once doesn't live up to the title of a perfectly fabricated story. All characters are likeable, even the antagonists, regardless of how big or small their role is in the story. The anime is crafted with perfect logic and research, even the fiction somehow makes sense. The artstyle, soundtracks, voice acting, openings and ESPECIALLY endings exceed expectations and are equally as beautiful as the rest of the anime's parts.",10
"
                Hunter X Hunter is without a doubt, the best battle shounen I have ever watched and one of my favourite shows of all time. You’ve probably heard this before. Super cliché, right? I’ll back it up with a few paragraphs in a bit. 
While watching this well-paced, thrilling anime, all I could think about is when I could watch the next episode. Togashi decides when the audience is ready for ground-breaking new information and delivers it like a champ. 
This anime contains what some believe to be the best anime arc to be ever created. Although the Chimera ant arc’s beginning is definitely one of
                  the dullest parts of the anime, it is essential to finish it to fully understand and enjoy the best part of it, which is around 40 episodes in (Yeah, it’s pretty long). I like to think of it as similar to the relationship between Clannad and Clannad: Afterstory. 
The fights are unique for the genre in the sense that the audience gets lots of background information (this sometimes does come as redundant narration) behind each of a character’s actions, rather than just a flurry of attacks being engaged between combatants, which is definitely more aesthetically pleasing, though.
The last part of this TL;DR is to tell how lovable the main characters are in this show. Simply, they are just presented in a way where it is hard to not like them. The bonds between many of the characters, even side characters, are extremely interesting to see. However, like most, I wish we could have seen more of Kurapika and Leorio. (◞‸◟)
Arcs:
Hunter Exam (9/10) – we are immediately introduced to many characters we would end up seeing regularly through the show and get a small amount of information about this Hunter world. It also shows a variety of different characters and abilities and although many of them die or are never seen again throughout the show, we see a starting power level being set through them. 
Zoldyc Family (7/10) – a very short arc in which we get to see a lot into the mysterious family of Killua Zoldyc. A very interesting thing we see is a huge power difference between Killua and the rest of the main cast. Regardless of its pros, the arc was pretty uneventful.
Heavens Arena (8/10) – The most important part of this arc is probably the introduction to the Hunter world’s superpower system, Nen. It is the best superpower system I have seen due to its very clear-cut rules and it’s very evident that quite a lot of thought went into it. We also see the main characters grow stronger and there are a few interesting fights as well. 
Yorknew City (10/10) – this arc introduces a very cool villain group, the Phantom Troupe. From their personalities to their abilities, everything about them is amazing. This arc is focused mostly on Kurapika. Meanwhile, the other 3 try to provide Kurapika with support but he doesn’t need help. ‘Cause he’s OP. Just for this arc, though. 
Greed Island (6/10) – 2 of the main characters are once again more prominent in this arc. My main problem with this arc is probably that most of the side characters are really lack-lustre and boring and are literally never seen again after they served their purpose of delivering a few lines.
Chimera Ant (9/10) – A weird species called Chimera Ant get really strong with the help of human DNA and pose a huge threat to humanity. I really want to give it a 10 but I can’t ignore that first part of it. Although, the ending was amazing, those first episodes left me quite unsettled with the whole experience. 
Chairman Election (7/10) – Despite the name, this arc isn’t completely focused on the election. We do see a lot of Hunters, that are apparently really strong, introduced but their abilities aren’t showcased. 
Scores:
Story (8/10) - The anime had a great ending, even though it wasn’t the ending to the series. It was very satisfactory and it will be interesting if the next arc can top the ones before it.
Art/Animation (9/10) - The art was pretty standard but the animation was really good; it was extremely smooth and when required it was very useful to convey the mood and intensity of the situation. 
Sound (9/10) - I don't really care that the same 3 songs (that had the same tune) were reused throughout the series for the opening. The song itself was pretty catchy and sounded cheery, this was especially interesting in the CA arc, where things got pretty dark. The ending, however, was always changed very arc, and I really liked all of them. Some episodes, within the arc would also have a different ending to match the tone of the ending of the episode, which you gotta applaud.
Characters (10/10) – Once again, the characters are really lovable in this show, villains or MCs. (Except for the half a dozen Chimera Ants that got too much screen time but we don’t talk about them.) You'll probably end up having a few favourites among the side characters by the time the show ends because there are LOTS of worthy candidates.
Enjoyment (10/10) - Every arc ended up venturing through a different subject, entirely from survival to tournament to the mafia. I loved the various twists and turns, loved the intense music that would only play occasionally, so you knew that when it did, shit was about to go down. And I'll say it once more in this interview, I loved the characters.
Overall (10/10) - Looking back, objectively, this anime does have some flaws but when I finished this anime, I looked back and wondered, would I ever have this much fun watching a show ever again? And the answer is yes because I'll just re-watch it next year.
P.S.: I've watched a few shows where I got that exact feeling and I find something great in another 1-2 months so I figured that I don't need to worry too much.",10

                I don't usually write reviews, in fact this is my first one on this website. If I do write one, it's either because I consider a show absolutely worth it, really mediocre/bad, or simply overrated -- it could be good or bad, but gets more praise than it's worth. In this case it's the latter. I'll be blunt : Hunter x Hunter is the most overrated anime I've ever seen, and rarely ever criticized thoroughly ( because most haters just stop at ""overrated"" ). Thus, I believe I should give a more detailed review explaining why Hunter x Hunter is NOT a masterpiece. Please bear
                  with me as I do so.
Since I tend to be generous with my ratings I decided to be more honest here to really get my point across. The first three arcs of the show ( the Hunter Exam + Zoldyck Manor, Heaven's Arena and Yorknew City ) are actually quite solid, ny favorite being the Yorknew City arc, for obvious reasons. The Hunter Exam serves as a good way to start the series, introducing us to the concept of a Hunter ( though it's never exactly confirmed what a Hunter does ) , to our main characters and the world they live in. Their hopes, dreams and goals. Almost all of these characters are likeable and easy to root for, with the major exception of Hisoka who really is just a pedophile and the most overrated character in the entire show. The Hunter Exam, though not portrayed as deadly, is, in fact, very deadly. Dozens of people die after each stage which isn't made a big deal, strangely, apparently it's completely normal to send people to their deaths and forget them like that, but still an enjoyable arc.
Heaven's Arena is when we get introduced to the concept of Nen, the art of using one's aura, the energy of your soul, as a weapon. This becomes the main fighting system of the series, and is quite an interesting concept. Since everyone is different, everyone's aura manifests differently, leading to original fighting styles. Sadly, because of the sudden appearance of this magic system, the arc, holding lots of potential to dramatic fights against family or dangerous foe, was turned into a training arc. Lost potential.
Now here comes the best arc of the entire series. Kurapika, which up until now was really just the revenge guy of the group, very likeable but quite bland, suddenly shot up the ranks of my favorite characters in the show and took first place away from Killua. The coolest character, and the one that carried the entire arc. If it weren't for him, Yorknew City wouldn't have been half as good. This arc set the stage for great potential, great villains and side characters, Melody for example. Sadly, Hunter x Hunter did not take that opportunity and fell into the depths of the Abyss.
Now, the next arc, Greed Island, is not that bad in itself. We get introduced to Bisky, who is the only remotely important female in the cast. She's quite cool, but is also the only objectively good thing that happened in this arc. During these 17 episodes, we see the Phantom Troupe, the main villains of the story, looking for a Nen exorcist in the Greed Island game that might free their Boss from Kurapika's Judgment Chain curse. What happened to them ? Good question. There was indeed a Nen exorcist running around, but he just disappears and was never important anyway. We don't ever see the Phantom Troupe succeed or fail in their mission, we're just left to assume they didn't find him after the events of the next arc. We also discover that the game Greed Island was actually just an isolated island the players are transported to, they're not actually inside a game. The supposed NPCs are actually criminals chosen to act as NPCs. Isn't that super cool ? But we learn absolutely nothing about it. Gon, the main character, doesn't even try to figure it out, he just wants to enjoy the game. By the way, this arc was also about training, just wanted to make that clear. Also, the set plot form the first arc was for Gon to find his father. That's why he played this game, because he hoped to find clues about where he might be. But right off the bat we are told that there is absolutely no point in playing this game. No. Point. It was a pointless arc.
The worst arc in the show is by far the most popular and famous arc : Chimera Ants. Need I say more than it has terrible pacing ? Actually, yes. The pacing doesn't even begin to describe the boredom I felt during this arc. It had potential. Seeing the villain of the arc, Meruem grow human more and more after each episode was a pleasure. It was the only thing that I can truly give this arc credit for. The dammed narrator is also constantly babbling about the smallest detail, in the end we barely even hear the dialog anymore, it's just narration, narration and more narration. The same track is constantly used which in the end just makes everything feel pathetically unimportant. The raid, which if I remember correctly is only supposed to be less than an hour long, was stretched out into some 30 episodes ( more than that ) taking away all the weight it bore. I almost dropped the show during this arc simply because it was so stretched out.
And finally, the election. Gon is severely injured. He used up all his Nen, and his body is completely utterly shriveled. The only way to heal him that Killua could think of was to find his cursed sister, Alluka, who bears a second soul called Nanika ( ""something"" in Japanese ) that grants wishes after three requests were realized. All the while, Leorio, one of the other forgotten main characters, gets tangled up in an election to replace Chairman Netero who died during the Chimera Ant raid. And guess who attends the election ? Freaking Gon's dad.
So you're telling me that all this time, all this effort, everything the characters sacrificed, was for nothing ? Ging just needed to casually show up at an election, there was NO need for Gon to lose his Nen, for him to play Greed Island or get tangled up with the mafia in Yorknew City  and if he became a Hunter just to find his dad, than that was useless too ! The entire series, everything we've been told, was made useless, and this extinguished the last tiny spark Hunter x Hunter had. So in conclusion, the plot of this show ? Not worth it. Heck, it's on hiatus , so there's still more to this atrocity called storytelling.
But let me talk about the characters for a second. Despite what I just said, the enjoyment you get from the show is genuine. It's far from a masterpiece, but it's a fun show to watch at 3 in the morning when you're going for one night without sleep. How so ? The characters, are for me, a 7 out of 10.
First we have our protagonist, Gon. He's a twelve year old Hunter who just wants to see his dad, the father he so admires. He's portrayed a sa sweet boy with lots of fighting potential, though he's quite dimwitted. He just wants to spend time with his friends, and is the most optimistic character I know in anime. But all throughout the show, we get hints that he's all messed up inside, that there's this lingering darkness that makes him... a psychopath. And by psychopath, I mean the actual mental disease, not the serial killer that everyone likes, like Juuzou Suzuya or Junko. He probably is the character with the least empathy in the show. He doesn't care about who he doesn't know, and doesn't try to know them. He doesn't try to put himself in other people's shoes. That's Gon.
Killua, a former twelve year old assassin from a reputed assassin family, is the one you'd think is most likely to be the psychopath. But in fact, he's probably, with Leorio, the sanest person in the show. He's a down-to-earth guy who doesn't take the same enjoyment Gon does when his life is at stake ( because that's something Gon enjoys for some reason ), and actually cares about the people around him. He feels for them, even those he always quarrels with. Take Palm or the octopus guy for example. He keeps fighting with Palm, but it's precisely because of that that he'd trust her with his life. The octopus guy (forgot his name, sorry ), a Chimera Ant that he BEFRIENDED, because he admired his courage and loyalty to his comrades. People who never watched Hunter x Hunter probably think he's popular because he's a badass. Those who've actually watched to show would disagree, because he's much more than that. That's Killua.
Leorio is, in my opinion, very boring and annoying. During the election, he recklessly dragged himself into problems he couldn't care less about and neither did we. He kept talking about Gon and how Gon sacrificed himself and how he cares about nothing else but Gon and how his father should just go die because he's not visiting Gon. I'll admit that Ging is a jerk, but Leorio is just acting childish here. However his ambitions are understandable, and his dreams are honest. Like Melody said, he's still a kind and gentle person, and would make an excellent doctor.
Now, my favorite character, Kurapika. Wasted potential, if you ask me. Right when he gets super cool he completely disappears from the show and never reappears again. He doesn't answer the damn phone calls but he should, and that is just lazy writing in my opinion. Thus, just when Kurapika became the coolest dude ever, he vanished forever.
So that's my overall thoughts on Hunter x Hunter. I used a lot of strong words for this, but really did enjoy watching the show. It has many flaws that I wanted to make light on, but other than that, if you're even just a little interested in Hunter x Hunter, you would get at least some enjoyment from it. 7/10",7

                If someone will ask me, ""What is your favorite anime?"" I would certainly say HunterxHunter. If anyone needs anime, I won't hesitate to recommend this masterpiece. The story revolves around Gon, son of Ging, Gon has great potential to be the best Hunter in the HunterxHunter universe. The anime really delivers well in every arc, thanks to MadHouse. This Anime has the best sound design and character development I have ever witnessed in its genre. The effects were spectacular and combining it with an amazing story, then you'll have a 10 out of 10 if not 11 rating. I recomend this masterpiece to every viewer
                  out there who wants a fun ride.",10

                This anime is legendary.
If I had the time, I would go into detail and explain everything that makes this anime phenomenal, but unfortunately I dont plus it might ruin it for you.
All I will say is this, if your looking for good characters, if your looking for action and intensity, if you looking for a series that will keep you watching until the end never feeling boredom.
THEN LOOK NO FURTHER FOR YOU HAVE FOUND IT! 
If your sceptical I understand, despite this animes greatness and despite the fact that many popular anime have taken inspiration from this series for example Naruto; very few have either
                  watched it or are aware of its existence...But trust me, its worth a try because no matter what...
You wont regret it.",10

                Hunter x Hunter 2011 is an anime that is beloved by many, its a small miracle that it took me so long to watch it since I really enjoyed Yu Yu Hakusho , a famous prior work by the same author.  I will say that I didn't think Hunter x Hunter was an amazing show, even though I do think that overall it was solidly enjoyable.
Most people know the general plot by now, but basically we get to follow Gon and some friends he makes early in the show , on various adventures with a loosely connected plot thread of Gon idealizing his father
                  Ging and wanting to find him. 
It's difficult to state my opinion about this anime without saying some things about the individual arcs within the anime in particular, because I feel like some of them are much better than the others.
I will say that I was pretty pissed with the beginning of Hunter x Hunter,  mostly with the series' first arc, the Hunter exam. I did not like Gon as the happy go lucky character who gets his ass beat more often than not. I found most of the arc to be very generic shonen stuff and the pacing was not great in my opinion, it almost made me stop watching the series to be honest. Some other arcs like the Heaven's Arena, Greed Island, Zoldyk Family, I enjoyed a little more than the first arc but I still thought they were overall fairly mediocre and generic, minus the Hisoka fight, nen discovery in Heaven's Arena and a surprisingly fun and interesting sports match in Greed Island.
I think I was finally able to witness the true potential of Hunter x Hunter within the Yorknew City and Chimera Ant arcs. The Yorknew Ark had a much darker , serious, and more interesting tone than the previous ones in the series, it also had some interesting plot developments and great interactions between the main cast of characters and the Phantom Troupe members. The Chimera Ant arc I think was the best , it had a number of very interesting characters , emotional stories, political intrigue , events that made me question morality and human nature, and the most riveting plot by far.  I still think it was quite flawed though due to it being so long, the battles in the last half of the arc are way too long taking multiple episodes to conclude. 
One of the main disappointments that I had with this show was Gon. It may just be a matter of personal preference but I ended up hating how happy and carefree he was through much of the anime. At no point in the anime did I think he was a particularly interesting character and he didn't do much to make me care about him other than having that terribly cheesy drive to give everything his all and never give up.  I also thought that there was a lot of wasted potential on the character of Leorio, he is the oldest of the main characters, has a very cool character design reminiscent of Vash the Stampede from Trigun, but for whatever reason the author chooses to relegate him to be the joke character or simply absent for much of the series.
I think in multiple arcs Hunter x Hunter anime had a problem with pacing. Some examples are the running in the Hunter Exam, too many training episodes, and a few fights taking way too long to resolve themselves. 
The good thing about Hunter x Hunter was that I found a decent number of characters that I did enjoy quite a bit. Some of the standouts were Hisoka, many of the Phantom Troupe members, Kurapika, Killua, Ging, Mereum, Netero, Kite, various members of the Zoldyck family, and some of the more interesting Chimera Ant figures like the Koala guy and Colt.  Pretty much any scene with Hisoka in it was entertaining as hell, even if his real underlying motives were somewhat shallow in my opinion. Killua is an especially awesome character who always kicks ass, is very analytical and smart, but also quite compassionate about his friends and family as well. 
The last arc of the anime was fairly dry for the most part in my opinion, but I did for whatever reason really enjoy one very emotional and well done plotline between a certain character and someone he cares about a lot.
I was impressed with the animation quality , artwork, and sound for the anime which I thought were all well done. The openings and endings were pretty catchy for the most part, the animation is usually slick and crisp, and I like the author's character designs of a lot of different characters like Kite, Hisoka, Meruem, Kiillua, and post Nen-training Kurapika. 
Overall I think Hunter x Hunter was worth watching. But I don't believe that it was consistently great like a lot of other people seem to believe.  It has a couple of standout arcs, some admittedly good entertaining characters, but beyond that I feel like this show did not do enough to make me consider it as one of the best ones I have watched. I think my rating and evaluation of the show would be totally different if I were just judging the Yorknew and Chimera arcs but I try to take everything into consideration when I review any anime or manga. I believe if there were more of of a continuous , engrossing plot instead of almost unrelated arcs of varying quality this show could have been much better in my opinion. 
As a side note, it's sad that the current state of the manga is so deplorable with long hiatuses taken by the author, especially given this newest arc seems pretty interesting to me .",7

                From my analysis of the Chimera Ant arc, originally posted on instagram:
The Palace Invasion that takes place during the Chimera Ant arc of Hunter X Hunter may be the most ambitious and downright crazy thing that has ever happened in anime/manga history. The idea to have about 30 episodes of the anime take place over the course of around 5 minutes in the show sounds like a terrible idea but Togashi was somehow able to pull it off. Pulling off such a feat can only be described as genius. The amount of character development that happens during this period is astonishing. To give some examples,
                  Pitou goes from a creature who only sees humans as prey to one that is able to recognise the value of human life, all before her/his own life is cut tragically short. Youpi goes from a monster that only sees humans as weaklings to a compassionate person capable of recognising the effort that the humans are putting in to fight and even respect them for it. There are far more masterful developments in character in this 5 minute time period but frankly there’s just not enough space to write about them. The Palace Invasion is also a great study in chaos theory as every little thing that happens has a massive effect on everyone involved. It may not sound like it, but watching Killua turn around for a split second was incredibly stressful as it had been established that time was of the essence and even the smallest change in plans could have negative consequences on the entire operation. The fact that Togashi was able to construct all of these scenarios and how they would affect each other so well is unbelievable. Not to mention the fight between Netero and Meruem, to even argue that this isn’t the greatest fight in anime history is stupid. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the whole fight is the moment in which Netero chooses not to converse with Meruem before the fight out of fear that they might actually come to an understanding. I wish I could write more but unfortunately Instagram has a word limit. I hope that I have expressed why this aspect of the Chimera Ant arc is so great. (Continued in part 2)
Meruem is the Chimera Ant arc’s main villain and my favourite character in the entire series. The character arc that Meruem goes through is perhaps the best in anime/manga history and is the backbone for the entire arc. When Meruem is first introduced he is a ruthless leader who believes that he is destined to rule the world and therefor has absolutely no value for anyone else’s life. It is safe to say that Meruem had absolutely no redeeming qualities and was the personification of evil upon his introduction. However, this all changes when the young blind girl Komugi is introduced. At first Meruem sees her only as an opponent to play board games with to kill time but without realising eventually comes to value her life. A brilliant scene that shows this is the scene in which Meruem has decided to kill her to reaffirm his own power, however when he comes across her being attacked by a bird he rushes to her rescue. This scene is beautiful as it not only confirms that Meruem does in fact care about Komugi but presents him in a light that had never been scene up to that point, one of compassion and humanity. Togashi did an excellent job painting Meruem in such a humane light when he was born to be the complete opposite. Meruem’s care for Komugi escalates to the point in which it completely changes his outlook on the world. Through Komugi, Meruem was able see the value in human life. Meruem’s fight with Netero further cements these thoughts that he had been having. Despite being a human, Netero had been able to reach such power that he was able to harm him. This causes Meruem to respect someone’s fighting ability for the first time, thus also recognising the potential for human evolution. It is this tremendous amount of character development that makes it all the more heartbreaking to see Meruem meet his end. Despite being heartbreaking, it is beautiful in a way as Meruem is able to spend his final moments with the one that he cherishes the most, Komugi. I have said it many times, but Togashi is truly a genuis. To progress Meruem’s character from a ruthless monster to the most human character in the entire arc is absolutely brilliant. (Continued in part 3)
The portrayal of humanity in the Chimera Ant arc is perhaps the most thought provoking part of the entire arc and plays a big part in making it the masterpiece that it is. Throughout the arc, the human characters seem to slowly lose their humanity while the ants become more and more human. This is mostly shown through the parallel character arcs of Meruem and Gon. I have discussed Meruem at length in a previous post so this part will be focused mostly on Gon. Gon starts of as perhaps the most compassionate and human character in the entire anime but due to the horrific things he has to endure, he changes into more of a monster than any of the ants. This change paints humanity in a very negative light as even the most human character of all is easily emotionally broken and brought down to the level of the inhuman ants. All the while, the ants are portrayed in an increasingly positive light, this is shown mostly through Meruem’s character arc but also when Pitou has to stop Gon from succumbing to his rage and killing both her and the injured human that she is treating. In this moment, Gon is willing to kill an innocent human purely because he lacks the humanity that he once had. This negative portrayal of humanity is also present in Meruem’s fight with Netero. Despite this fight being between a monster and a human, it is genuinely hard to want either of them to win, this is due to the humanity that Meruem has developed. As I have said before, my favourite moment of this entire fight is the moment in which Netero chooses not to converse with Meruem out of fear that they might come to an understanding. Meruem only wishes to have a discussion with Netero and even says that he can only be defeated with words. Netero recognises that Meruem has now become more human than most humans and therefor decides to try and kill him before he has the chance the actually think about his actions. This in turns makes not only Meruem look like the more human one, but the Chimera ant species as a whole. There are countless scenes in which Meruem’s character arc portrays humanity in extremely negative ways but I believe I have made my point. (Continued in part 4)
In closing, the Chimera Ant arc of Hunter X Hunter is possibly my favourite arc in anime/manga history. If you disagree then that’s fine, but I consider it a masterpiece. The purpose of these posts was to have somewhere to direct people to when they asked why I loved the arc so much. I feel as though I have made my thoughts on the Chimera Ant arc very clear and probably don’t need to make another post about it ever again. Let me know if you liked the posts and whether you would be interested in me doing something similar in the future (a multiple part series on an anime). Thanks. (Chimera Ant arc score: 10/10)",10

                Shounen anime are known power-ups which really makes no sense, the story behind it feels very weak and illogical, even going by the anime in questions; worlds physics and rules. It's just there to hype you up, make you excited and that in of itself is not a bad thing so to say. However, the build-up to this point, through the world, the character's is very important. This is something I would say Hunter x Hunter accomplishes very well and is one of the few who really managed to hit the right notes for this and so much more.
Story
It starts out with centering around a
                  young boy, named Gon who sets out on a journey to find his father. Sounds simple enough, but it's the journey to get there and how it does it, is what makes HxH quite special and amazing. For starters, the battles are interesting and fascinating which reflects the rules set up by this world and it does a great job of showing it to us. It's not as simple as he is the main character and he will win every battle without any real effort or trouble. Since it can, in fact, affect us emotionally.
At one point, you will be glued to the screen watching this young boy hunting his prey for his own goals and while he is doing so, you get to see and hear everything that is going through his head at the time, and it leaves you with his feeling of how dangerous this situation really is and how dire the consequences could become if he where to be detected by his prey. This is just one segment among many which are directed and told so well that you can't help but be glued to your screen watching this all unfold. However, there is more.
What makes it even more fascinating, is the fact that Gon is terrified while doing so, he is very aware that he could die if he were to mess this up and how his character portrays this, through his actions and emotions, is a job well done. He doesn't directly attack the enemy with a one-track mind, he actually strategies on how to hunt his prey. He learns all the ingredients necessary trough mother nature and other hunters he managed to catch a glimpse of doing his own thing.
A big factor in most shounen anime is power, and Gon is not someone anyone normal would want to mess with, even adults. For his age of 12 years old, he is quite strong and fast, and you would rather avoid getting on his bad side if you know what's best for you. Though, being honest, if brute force was the only thing HxH had going for it, the popularity of it would make no sense. 
We actually have another type of power and what makes it stand out from most of the others, is how complex and interesting it is. It's not as simple like just getting stronger, unlocking your potential, to mention some. It has its own categories which reflect the user's personality and depending on where you have lived, spent your times most, all of this is important in figuring out your type and which category it falls in. Gon is one you would list under Enhancer, these types tend to be simple and straightforward in their demeanour. 
This focuses on the physical aspect of the user, his life energy and how to use it to achieve stronger and greater power. However, it's not that easy, if you were to mess it up, you could put your entire life in danger, you need to know how much to put in each of your attacks and this is not easy and puts our character's through gruelling and intense training segments to make them able to control this power more efficiently and figure out how you would want to use it. 
There is more to this power, but if I were to delve further into it, this entire review would mostly just be focused around that. What I can say, is that at one point, the anime had a one-hour explanation for this power which was one of the most exciting and mesmerizing dialogue I heard in my all time watching anime.
Sound
As for sound, effects, music, it nails all those parts and gives you a great list of many amazing tracks you can't help but get addicted to, at least I was. It feels spot-on and does a great job of reflecting the overall atmosphere and feel of the anime. Like, it would make sense to get bored of listening to the same opening song, over and over, but the things are you don't and I can't describe properly ""why?"". First, you might start out disliking the opening (why would you, though?), yet after few times of listening to it, most persons would be addicted and can't stop listening. It also hits those nostalgia notes well if you are re-watching the anime. The same could also be said for the ending songs. 
The effects are another thing which feels spot-on, not only is Madhouse great at using it, but also manipulating to give you the sense if a character is one assassin, you can barely hear his footsteps, when he runs you can't see sand blowing upward from the steps he takes. Action segments are no exception either, the hits or slashes among other things are done extremely well. Madhouse seriously outdid itself and deserves all the praise they get.
Art
The art and animation is another big deal aspect to an anime and HxH, is one of the best and most consistent. I don't think there was even a moment when I was watching this anime I taught it looked terrible. Especially, during the fight scenes, it looks and feels amazing and you can't help but be drawn toward it. It's so fluid with some of the greatest sakuga I have seen. 
Also, depending on the situations, Madhouse does a great job of adapting to it, like the facial expression at comedic or serious moments. Lightning, shading and colours adjustments, determined by the mood or tone of the situations or even the arc in question.
Characters 
Just having a good story or writing is not enough, for me at least. You need to love or hate the characters and I can safely assure you that HxH does an amazing job of executing them. They feel alive, quirky, noisy, and have a likeable personality which really makes it so you don't forget them easily or the individual's own name. HxH has a huge cast of characters and they all feel necessary to progress our main characters. 
Gon at the start feels simple and straightforward, but as you move forward with the story you start to see flaws in him, I mean he is 12 years old so its logical, it would make sense to have some noteworthy issues which make him stand out, and make him more of interesting or annoying character, depending on which category you fall in. In fact, if he or the other character's where perfect it would be boring to follow such a main character, wouldn't you agree?
My favourite part about HxH, though, is the villains or antagonists. You start out with hating them when you learn what hell they put one of your main characters through but when you learn more about them, and you just can't help but like them.. and suddenly, you don't want them to be killed off but be incorporated in the story somehow, to maybe get them a main role in the story because they are just that much interesting and lovable and you can't help but be drawn to their silly nature and personality. 
It also features one of my favoured antagonists, I started out with absolutely hating him and his one-track mind nature of being the best of them all. However, he was still just new to the world, and once he learns more and starts to interact with characters, which really challenged his original demeanour. I just couldn't help but really like him and not wishing death upon him. He is easily one of the most complex written antagonists and I seriously hope I can find more character's like him.
You will cry for them, you will hate them, you will love them.
The Negative
This anime deserves all the praise it gets, it's not perfect by any means, but probably close. However, just like any other series, it does come with some flaws which can make the viewer drop it or completely skip over it. For starters, it's very slow paced and takes it's time to build up. This is not an issue for me, but it might be for other persons, and if they were to stop watching. They will be skipping one amazing anime, which I think at one point, every anime watcher should give a try, it's just that worthy for me.
During a certain very big arc, the pacing became even slower, the explanations for simple things, which could be shown through the animation and art making it more enjoyable is less visible and you get tons of unnecessary info dumping which could be skipped over or replaced with more interesting events. 
This is my biggest flaw in the anime I don't know how the manga handles this but just in this regard, the anime did fail to satisfy me. However, this is becoming one tiny nitpick that is easily solved if you watch the anime in a binge. I am one of the persons who experience this arc in a weekly airing manner and it was not fun to sit through 20 minutes of an episode of not really seeing any real progression. Thankfully, I almost looked over this when I sat through the same arc for the second time.
Conclusion
Hunter x Hunter 2011 is one of a kind anime with some amazing and intelligent way to tell a good story, boasting some great and likeable characters. Not your typical shounen or anime with some awesome strategizing events and a power that is so complex and difficult to understand but is very fun to learn about, which totals up to my reason why this still stands strong as my favourite anime to this day and I urge everyone to give it a try, at some point in your life.

                Other Battle Shounen anime series like Fmab, One Piece and Jojo's are Tom and Jerry level..kiddy stuff compared to the greatness that is HxH. Not only is it the best shounen anime because of the brilliant outstanding Chimera ant arc, but also because of the amount of diversity and creativity put into each individual arc. Each arc has it`s own unique taste that it feels like every arc is a different show, while also connecting the story together. It`s Mind blowing. HxH was able to cross the boundaries between shounen and seinen in one arc in not even 90 episodes, seamlessly, and with only 148
                  it was able to accomplish what one piece and Naruto were never able to accomplish with their 700+ episodes, which is: 
1-The best character development in the least amount of time.
2-The best and most fleshed out power system in fiction. It's the most complex, creative, consistent and explained power system ever. I've seen them all Nen>Ki, Chakra, Haki, reitsu, Alchemy, Hamon, Stands, etc, they all pale in comparison. Not just when it comes to battle, but what it also tells you about a character's psyche and personally.
3- You will love the villains and even cheer for them against the heroes not because the heroes are lame but because the Villains are that good. 
4- characters are 3 dimensional and are very realistic and relatable not black and white but in the grey area..some of them to a certain extent though.
5- The author isn`t afraid to kill off characters and he is unpredictable unlike authors like Eiichiro Oda.
6- No plot holes, everything is explained to the fullest while leaving just enough for the viewers' interpretation and not letting them call plot holes. 
7- It`s only 148, and by the end of the series the main character achieves his dream and the reason he started his journey in the first place. Even though this not the definitive ending of the world of HxH, this is an incredibly satisfying finale. HunterXHunter has never been about the ending in the first place, it has always been a discovery based story about characters doing their lives. The world story as a whole doesn't need to end. Togashi-sensei created such an ever-expanding world, with tons of extremely developed and nuanced characters that feels like the protagonists of their own story...to the point that the idea of giving it a definitive ""proper"" ending, just feels wrong. 
Conclusion: 10/10 shows are not the ones with no flaws, 10/10 shows are the ones that do the most good, and Hunter × Hunter is definitely a 10/10.",10

Outstanding. Magnificent. The true meaning of masterpiece.
I can't say anything that hasn't been said before, the review section covers everything that is, the perfection of this series amazes me up to the point I'm writing this just for the sake of sharing this with my future me. If you Bit or anyone are reading this, yeah, there are spoilers here.
The quote above is said by Gon's father, it is the last thing said on the anime, and it is the true lesson of the
                  whole thing. I love how animes can give advice, life lesson, guidance on life, hxh isn't any different, the last episode reflects everything I just said, it is the conversation between Gon and Ging about the 147 journey that led him through there, only to realize that the journey was the goal but the real prize was everything conquered during this 147 episodes.
I loved every second of it, I loved how they never changed (or only slightly changed) the opening, how the characters stayed firm on their personalities, even loved how they managed to make a little romance out of this adventure. Hisoka became one of my favorite anime characters of all time, it is well written, well dubbed, well drawn, I just can't emphasize enough how much he is a sick villain.
I love how they introduce strong characters such as Killua to only later realize he's the weakest among everyone we thought were even weaker. The Nen whole thing is superb, so similar to the Chakra concept, but different and badass on the same level.
I won't forget HxH in a while and I do pretend to read the mangá, watch the movies and the originals, it is 2021 and I hope I can see the ending of this masterpiece and hopefully share with others that loved this as much as me.",10
"
                The thing with Hunter X Hunter is that you find both enjoyment and sadness. What you see in Hunter X Hunter which differentiates from other animes is that the characters are on the edge of death and sometimes they even tend to cross that edge. The point is that in HxH you never know what to expect, this makes it exciting for you as a viewer.
When looking at character creation, you can see the simple but creative tendencies. This doesn't always mean that it's bad, having it simple will help you memorize the characters which is good. What I also notice is that you can
                  see the characters identity through their eyes, the main protagonist ""Gon"" is high spririted which you can see in his glowing eyes. ""Killua"" also have same eyes in a sense, when Killua turn on his assasin instinct you can see both his eyes and face expression change dramatically.
When it comes to art I think we all can agree that this is outstanding. We can see the effort both in fights and out. By having good art you also need sounds and nice music. I really think HxH have some of the best OST's out there, this both reflects so you know when you're in an adventure mood and in fighting mood. The music helps us understand when the scenario is serious or not which is good in my opinion. 
In conclusion I really think this anime is worth watching, this is by far the best across. I think that this is really enjoyable for newcommers aswell, everything is perfectly executed which leaves small margin for criticizing. I also have some improvements for the story, but since it's a review I won't include spoilers.",10

Arc 1: Hunter Exam arc
This is where it all begins. It kicks off the story with a boy named gon, and it goes to introduce the characters and the setting in the first 5 episodes. Now of course, the main character Gon is the focus in this arc, but it also introduces you to the other main 4 characters. Killua, Kurapika and Leorio. Killua becomes Gon's best friend almost immediately and Gon becomes good friends with Leorio and Kurapika. Now they all take the hunter exam to become Hunters of the Hunter Association. To be a hunter is to be one of a kind strong. Not just anyone passes the hunter exam, you got to be exceptionally talented and have great potential. All of them have their own reasons to join the Hunter Exam but Gon's reason is to find his father, since his father abandoned him as a baby to become a hunter.
Arc 2: Zoldyck Family Arc is where you meet the rest of Killua's family, since they play a MASSIVE role in this universe. I won't get into it too much but his family is pretty nutty just like Killua. They're all pro hunters themselves. Great premise and definitely some heartwarming moments in this arc.
Arc 3: Heaven's Arena Arc is where it focuses on Gon and Killua, as they try to find a means to pass time and make some quick cash. Heaven's Arena is literally just a 200+ floor battle tower. Lots of fights and a few decent Hunters reside inside. Gon and Killua get a new trainer too. Imagine the World Martial Arts Tournament in Dragon Ball but BIGGER. Lots of getting pumped up in this arc, good fights and stuff. Osu!
Arc 4: Yorknew City Arc. This arc has to be #2 best arc in this anime. It is so meticulously crafted that it will leave you hanging on to the edge of your seat the entire time. Amazing fights, amazing plot line and such. This arc re-introduces Kurapika as the protagonist and focus with Gon, Killua and Leorio as the side characters. I love this arc personally. It's dark, raw, gritty and is fitting. If you like criminal underworld and mass genocide, you'll like this arc. That's all I'll say.
Arc 5: Greed Island Arc. This arc brings the focus back to Gon and Killua and puts them inside a game world called Greed Island, a game developed by Gon's Dad, who gon thinks his dad left clues to his location. They go inside but immediately encounter all sorts of trouble from thieves, to murderers. They run around and do quests and train with a new trainer in this arc. It's almost a light hearted arc with a small dark undertone. Imagine World of Warcraft if it was focused on collecting cards but had full PvP enabled.
Arc 6: Chimera Ant Arc. I won't delve too deep into this arc, as this is the arc you must watch. If you're going to give Hunter x Hunter a shot, atleast watch all the way through til this arc. You can ask literally ANYONE and they will say 10/10. This arc follows Gon and Killua after the events of Greed Island. It is a horrifying dark arc for an almost lighthearted anime but this will change your perspective on anime forever. Gon and Killua find a new trainer and Gon looks up to this new trainer almost as if he's an uncle or best friend. This is the peak of the anime. It has the best storyline out of all the arcs, out of all the animes thus far. It has lightheartedness but be prepared to cry. A lot. I know I did. 10/10 #1 Arc
Arc 7: Election Arc. The final arc to conclude the anime. This wraps up the entire mess that has happened in all the arcs preceding. This arc mainly follows Killua as well as a few others. It's a crazy yet super heartwarming arc and everything about this arc wrapping everything up is so perfect. The perfect conclusion. This arc makes this anime rewatchable so many times.
Story: 10/10.
Art: 10/10. It's good for being a 2011 Anime and I don't see how they could improve it at all.
Sound 9/10. It has many memorable tracks and tracks that fit the mood at that moment perfectly. From dark, creeping feelings, to Successful wins, from seeing someone with God-like power, to personifying a character in music. Also the Jap subs are the way to go. Grade A. Don't watch in the english dub because the english voice actors DO NOT fit the character voices.
Character 10/10. The character development and pacing is amazing. If a part in the story needs you to wait a month or so without you doing anything, they'll either timeskip or just start a new arc, as seen in the Heaven's Arena Arc. They don't mess around with the pacing and only show backstory for the really important bits. (Don't worry, this isn't naruto, you're not gunna see that swing 300 times.)
Enjoyment 10/10. I love gon as a character, and Killua is the perfect match for him. I love every other character too, even the repulsive ones because everything is thought out so intricately that no gaps are left in the story and you can really enjoy any character. For side characters that you never get to see, I love this ninja named Hanzo, a girl who is a bee keeper named Ponzu and of course Gon's Dad along with a few enemies.
Conclusion: This anime is worth watching, and rewatching. I finished it back in December of 2017 and I still can't stop talking about it.
Hunter x Hunter king of animes.",10

                I love this anime. This is worth watching. It is so joyful and fun. I love every arc aside from the chimera ant arc. It was too long and very dragged out, Aside from that arc it's 10/10.

"
                I didnt feel anything about the story.The only worthy part is about ants and i really liked it(10/10),but the other part is maximum 6/10,cuz they didn't developed many aspects of plot(like Kurapika as a character,Phantom troop and Hisoke also as character).I'm disappointed,cuz at the start it seems like u will be 
excited and satisfied with this world,but at the end the story isnt ended and characters are not disclosed.But ofc the soundtracks are amazing.As for me if u want to watch some cool Shonen anime,dont watch HXH,u should watch Naruto,which is 10/10.Dont waste ur time,guys(or just skip to ark with ants)

                This is a very fun anime if you turn your brain off. I enjoyed this one, especially towards the beginning. There are 6 arcs in this shonen, and the quality of the show varies wildly between them. Id say there are 2 halves of the show, with the show massively dropping in quality past the yorknew city arc.
The characters are a little generic but they are fun to watch. Hisoka is by far the best part of the show. He is an unpredictable pedo clown and he serves as a villain I guess? Whatever it is, hes great. The main cast is okay, albiet a
                  bit one note. Leorio is fun, but hes a bit one note. Kurapika is just the average revenge arc guy. Killua is likable. Gon, our protagonist is kinda like spongbob but stubborn. His power level throughout the show literally makes no sense. He can keep up with killua in the first arc because hes a child of the forest i guess, and also can beat up larry wheels without the use of nen in the second arc. According to some people hes also some great anti-hero or something??? Like fr if gon is a great anti-hero, then spongebob is the new walter white. I also think that people give too much credit to the ""nen"" system which to me, seems tacked on and lazy. Its literally your own superpower with ""drawbacks"" and the show towards the end doesn't even follow its own nen rules with alluka.  Its very obvious that the show created nen AFTER the first arc finished because its just a plot hole that NONE of the hunter applicants besides the nen trained ones knew about it when there are nen-ed up publicly broadcasted battles in the major arc after.  The phantom troupe is mostly randomly computer generated anime characters, but there are a few cool ones I guess. 
The show really takes a plunge when we get to greed island, which was one of the biggest wastes of time imaginable. The villian of this arc was so bland, and the ending of it was dumb. 
One of the largest issues of this arc was that it destroyed the shows sense of scale, and this issue is never resolved. There was also large amounts of exposition for a place that will never be returned to since it was in a video game. 
The chimera ant arc has the slowest pacing in the show. They strectched maybe like 30 episodes into 60, mindbogglingly slow episodes, especially towards the ending part. This arc wastes your time unlike any other. Morel was in the smoke for like 5 episodes. Random ants appear just for the sake of wasting our time like cheetu. Komugi was also so contrived, it was hard to take the ending of this arc seriously. Ants having people-memories when it was convenient is also some plot bullshit, 
The election arc is really boring, as it keeps cutting back to the bard of hunters and literally no one cares about them.
Overall i'd give the first half of this show like an 8, and the second half a 4, averaging at 6. This is one of those shows that gets worse the more you think about it, but if you can refrain from that and just watch the material then it is a fun show. It suffers from some shonen bullshit, such as exposition and narration problems, and battles where they just stand there and explain their tactics to each other and also scale problems, but it kept me entertained and im not going to lie to yall I had fun.",6
"
                I normally am not very negative and find it very easy to enjoy shows, but this show was a rare exception. To start off, I want to acknowledge that it is a unique show and the praise that it gets is justified, but I still feel that my experience differed vastly and it felt like a waste of time overall. For me, the show starts off strong with introducing a clear story and cool characters, but it loses me around the third arc. I felt that it lacked any sort of excitement or action and kept leading to anticlimactic moments for the sake of suspense
                  that didn't really lead anywhere. I'm trying not to spoil anything, but there's an episode around the 90's that relates to this arc and essentially contains everything that I thought this arc should've been: filled with action and character background/development. Beyond that, the following arc is irrelevant and serves mostly as a transition to the next arc which I felt could've been executed more appropriately instead of adding some throwaway story. The next arc after that drags on for way too long which is sort of excusable since the later half is quite honestly incredible. The biggest downsides that ruin it for me though are the bad character decisions, the random narration that's added which kills the mood, and plot armor in a sense (can't specify without spoiling). Ironically enough, the characters that were the most interesting and I connected with were 2 weak side characters who were introduced in the later half of that arc and don't show up after this arc which is slightly annoying. All these lead to a very disappointing feeling for me. The final arc, however, did restore some hope for me as it was brilliantly done. As I said, I don't really care for perfection or anything, but those three arcs in the middle of the series that spans a good near 75 episodes were very off putting and makes me not even want to continue onto the manga to know what happens next. A good majority of people seem to love this show, but I just think there are a lot of flaws that made it not enjoyable and made me regret pouring time into it.
Pros: Great characters, interesting settings, and plot-lines with a lot of potential
Cons: Poor story direction and decision making at points, retconned/irrelevant details in the story, bad pacing, soundtrack wasn't really memorable, and questionable power differences",5

                [WARNING: Contains very minor spoilers]
Since I am going to be reviewing anime that I find interesting from now on, I felt it was most important that I come back to review the greatest thing I have ever seen throughout my days on this planet, the show I have happily watched 3 times over. Hunter x Hunter 2011, a true masterpiece. 
Story - 9/10
The only reason the story gets a 9 instead of the 10 is because of some slightly questionable writing in the Chimera Ant Arc, particularly regarding how the ants gained their Nen abilities and prowess as it (imo) hurt the power system and
                  rules that the show previously set up. Otherwise however, the worldbuilding was impeccable. A fully fleshed out, vast and immersive world and a perfectly executed adventure plot. Don't be fooled by the bright colors and innocent, happy-go-lucky vibes in the first few episodes. This show explores some extremely dark themes and brings up some very philosophical questions. Just like the main character Gon, the viewers are slowly dragged out of their safe space and thrown into the vicious world of Hunter x Hunter.
Art - 10/10
The art was consistently good throughout all of HxH. Nothing more to state in this department other than the fact that every key moment and fight got all the justice it deserved from Madhouse.
It is usually said that the darker, grittier art of 1999 fit the show better, but I disagree completely. The light, colorful themes represent HxH to perfection; juxtaposing a pure kid adventuring into a cruel, dark world.
Sound - 10/10
Some of the most beautiful pieces to ever be played in anime. The soundtrack from HxH evokes emotion in me wherever I hear them. Classic moments of the show (you will know them if you watched) hold special places in the hearts of millions of viewers in large part due to amazing OST such as Hyori Ittai, Rasetsu, To Give a Marionette Life, Requiem Aranea etcetc.
Characters - 11/10
Forgive me for breaking the rating system, but the characters are what truly make Hunter x Hunter the greatest show of all time. It was an absolute must that I put this on another level from the already perfect sound and art.
Let's jump a little into why the characters are so great.
Gon - A pure, innocent child raised on an isolated island by his aunt Mito who left on a goal to find his missing father. A picture-perfect representation of what would actually happen to a pure, honest child when thrown into a world where they constantly see death and tragedy. Subverts many traditional shounen tropes to create an amazing main character.
Killua - The prodigious child of an assassin family who was tortured as a child and trained to only kill before leaving to find something he wants to do. On first look, his character seems to falls more in line with traditional shounens. Killua serves as the cool, laidback, strong secondary character that all the viewers want to be like. Upon deeper analysis however, one can see just how layered his character is. Killua has one of the most relatable problems ever: purposelessness. He is completely lost as to what he should do and decides to pour everything into helping Gon, who he sees as his 'light'. He has a massive inferiority complex and his own form of innocence even after such a torturous childhood; factors which made his character development immensely satisfying to watch.
Hisoka, Chrollo, Meruem - Literally the 3 best villains in anime history. Guys, I would be writing forever if I tried to explain Hisoka's endless pursuit of entertainment and how Togashi uses him as a narrative device, Chrollo's use of the Phantom Troupe as his identity, and Meruem's internal conflicts and how they are utilized to present philosophical questions. 
Cannot stress how well fleshed out these characters all are. Togashi is a genius.
Overall - OBVIOUS 10/10
I don't even need to type anything here after all that. This anime is a masterpiece. I don't think any human being can justifiably rate it under a 7. Just get through the first 5 episodes and you are well set. The only reason I could possibly not recommend HxH is because you will feel the pain that I do once you finish and realize that the author is on a huge hiatus.
But to be very honest, the pain is worth it. I repeat, this is the greatest show of all time.
NOTE: I don't know who will even read this so late, I basically wrote this because it would be disgraceful for me to start reviewing new anime without having a review for the GOAT on my page.

Togashi pls recover",10
"
                I have to say that I've watched both the original and this one, and I can clearly say that this one is the better version, not only because of the art, but also because the 2011 version fully adapts the manga, while the original adapts everything 'til the Greed Island Arc.
Now, let's start with the REAL Review.
Story (8)
A lot of people started the anime for the story. The others did it because of the animations and the vines they saw on Youtube. Anyway, the story is simple: Here is a boy who wants to find his father (which is a troll in anyway possible), a
                  guy with REALY big family problems, a guys who has a dark past, and a guy that is, pretty useless , until the last arc. Each one has it's own objective, but since the story has problems  in telling us how they will success is pretty weird. I mean, come on! (SPOILER) Gon meets his father and that's it. We don't know what happened with Leorio, Kurapika, and Killua, well, hard to tell.
To make it clear:
The Hunter Exam Arc: It was made to introduce the characters, so, nothing special.
The Zoldyck Arc: It was made in order to tell us how weird Killua's family is.
The Arena Arc: It was made for the sake of seeing Hisoka Vs Gon in an arena. And also, beacuse they had to tell us how Nen works.
The Yorknew Arc: THE BEST ARC! Finally, something brutal. That's how u tell how strong the evil guys are in the HunterXHunter world. If there is one thing that I hate about this arc, is the forced drama beetwen the Spider Gang. But Hey! Kurapika just went full Sasuke and kills some of the gang and... Yeah. Brutal, BTW.
The Greed Island Arc: Meant to show us what powers Gon and Killua will have in the next arc, and also how Gon's father has many friends. THAT'S IT.
The Chimera Arc: THE 2ND BEST ARC! The pacing ruined it (4 episodes and only 5 minutes have passed. RLY?).
The Election Arc: Leorio finally does something!!! And also, the end of Gon's Journey. OR IS IT?...
Art (10)
When you want good animated battles, you can always see an action anime made by MADHOUSE. And also, the characters look either cool, either funny. Nothing special for these guys. If you've watched any other action-packed anime by Madhouse, than you know what to expect. If not, well, see for yourself. Nice art, nothing important else to say.
Sound (10)
The opening is still in my mind, and the endings are awesome, fiting with their arc's pacing. And also, (talking about the Chimera Arc) if you invite the guys who created the Dovahkiin song, or, better said, the entire music in the game SKyrim, you know it's going to be good.
Character (7)
Why 7? For example:Killua, after the Yorknew Arc, he is mentioned in an episode later on and that's it. Same thing happened with the spiders, Leorio and the chairman.
Enjoyment (9)
I love this anime. Especially for the battles. And also because i am the biggest fan of the shounen genre.
Overall (9)
GO WATCH IT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS ANIME IS IN TOP 5 ANIME ON MAL!!!!",9
"
                For such a refreshing anime with so much about it to be liked, I'm honestly baffled by the fact that there isn't a larger fandom surrounding it. From a personal standpoint, I find it difficult to find any detrimental flaws which would hinder me from re-watching the show. If anything, I find myself constantly returning to certain parts and re-living the excitement I experienced during my first viewing of the show.
The first and possibly biggest selling point for me would be the characters. Each of them are unique, full of personality, entertaining to watch, and the majority come with interesting backstories and motives. Special mention
                  goes to Gon Freecss who could very well be one of my favourite main characters in anime to this day, as well as Hisoka who is an amazingly entertaining antagonist and an overall joy to watch. Other members of the 'main 4' including Kurapika, Killua and Leorio are all lovable, and they really do add many positives to the show.
The other big positive to the show would be the story which gripped me from the very first episode. There's no straightforward way to describe it, as the story constantly changes in genre and style. One moment, it's an action/adventure, then over time, it shifts to sci-fi/tragedy. Comedy, drama, fantasy, crime. Heck, in one arc, it's even a card/sports anime! It does a good job of keeping the viewer interested while still managing to remain relatively straightforward and easy to understand.
Overall, if you have ever considered watching this anime, I'd say go for it at the soonest convenience. With 148 episodes of some of the purest fun I've had watching an anime, and with only 2 recap episodes and no fillers, it's a quality show which really deserves more viewers.",10
"
                Hunter x Hunter is a very interesting mixed bag of a series. As the series goes on, the arcs start to become less and less connected to each other and start to features the main characters less and less. I overall enjoyed my experience with this show, but if I were to describe HxH in two words, those words would be inconsistent and overrated.
I'll start with the positives. Most of HxH's arcs are actually pretty good. Hunter Exam, Greed Island, and the Election arc were all really fun. While the Yorknew auction arc was a little messy, it also had a lot of good moments.
                  The ED's for most arcs are also great.
There are a lot of interesting powers, locations, and character dynamics that are explored in this show. Of all the characters in the show, Killua's arc is one of the most interesting and well-developed. HxH also has pretty good trans representation in Killua's sister, Alluka. Her arc is especially impactful due to it having a lot of metaphors for how trans people struggle with being accepted by their families.
Now for the negatives:
The OP uses the same song for all 148 episodes. It switches between the first and second verse every now and again, but that doesn't really keep it from getting tiring. I very rarely skip anime OP's, but I found myself skipping this one a large portion of the time, especially since it really doesn't fit with some of the darker parts of the show.
My biggest issue with HxH is the boring mess that is the Chimera Ant arc. It takes up 61 episodes, which is over 41% of the entire show. I cannot fathom how anyone could think this arc is the best arc in the show.
[The following section contains spoilers]
The pacing of Chimera Ant is abysmal. Large portions of episodes are spent establishing boring ant characters who are easily killed off later and have no real impact on the story. There is simultaneously too much time spent trying to humanize the minor ant characters and too much time spent showing how awful and cruel they are. There are multiple fights and characters that could be cut without really impacting the story.
Gon's arc during Chimera Ant also isn't handled well. The audience doesn't get enough time to get attached to Kite, so his death isn't nearly as impactful as it would need to be to pull off the story they were trying to tell. Kite just kinda shows up, fights a couple of times and then dies. This is worsened by how much of this time is spent with boring development of ant characters who will have no impact on the story thrown in between.
This arc also randomly has a narrator when the other arcs don't. Chimera Ant breaks the rule of show don't tell so often that it's comical at points. Instead of getting inner monologues of what the characters might be thinking, viewers (or should I say listeners at this point) get lengthy speeches describing what can be clearly seen happening on screen. A lot of the emotional moments don't have proper impact because the narrator can't shut up for long enough for the audience to breathe and take things in.
The ending of Chimera ant is the best part because the narrator finally shuts up and lets the moment have the proper space and weight.
If Chimera Ant was about 10-20 episodes shorter and didn't have as much narration, it would actually be pretty alright.
Overall, even though HxH was very enjoyable at times, it was also a huge disappointment for such a highly-rated show. Too much time was spent on a dismal arc that drags the rest of the series down. If all the extraneous material was trimmed out, I'd probably rate HxH a 7 or even an 8, but as it stands I can't give it any higher than a 6.",6
"
                HunterXHunter(2011) is the best battle Shounen anime of all time ,Other battle Shounen anime series Naruto, One piece,Fmab,Bleach,Fairytail etc are Tom and Jerry level..kiddy stuff compared to the greatness that is HxH~ Not only it is the best Shounen anime because of the insanely brilliant outstanding Chimera ant arc, but also the amount of diversity and creativity put into each individual arc. Each arc has it`s own unique taste that it feels like every arc is a different SHOW!!!!!!!!!! while also connecting the story together...It`s Mind blowing and absolutely genius.No Shounen Anime was able to accomplish what HxH is able to,HxH has no limits,it was
                  able to cross the boundaries between Shounen and Seinen in one arc in not even 90 episodes, and with only 148 it was able to accomplish what one piece and Naruto were never able to accomplish with their 700+ episodes which is 1-the best character development in the least amount of time.2- Best power system in Fiction , it's the most complex ,creative,well explained power system Period..like for real!!Nen>Ki,Chakra,Haki,reitsu,Alchemy,Hamon,Stands and any Fiction , they all pale in comparison. Just unlimited possibilities....ENDLESS !!!!!!! 3- you will love the villains\Antagonists and even cheer for them against the Protagonists not because the { heroes }are lame but because the Antagonists are that good. 4- characters are 3 dimensional and are very realistic and relatable not black and white but in the grey area..some of them to a certain extent though ~ 5-The author isn`t afraid to kill off characters and he is unpredictable unlike Kishimoto and Oda. 6-no plot holes and everything is explained to the fullest while leaving just enough for the viewers to decide and not letting them call plot holes~ ...and again it`s only 148,can you imagine what it can accomplish more if it continues,If Togashi Yushihiro really wants to be the best....Yeah buddy it`s not only he`s gonna take over the Anime/Manga world but FICTION in general ~It's a masterpiece and if there is ever a 10/10 anime then this is the only one.",10

                Warning, this review might/will contain spoilers. This review is also purely based on my opinion.
Considering how great hunter x hunter (2011) is, i just HAD to write this as my FIRST ever and probably will be my ONLY ever anime review.
At first, I was pretty disappointed when i watched the first few episodes. I thought and felt it was a pretty average start to a supposedly ""masterpiece"" of an anime. I don't know how stupid I must've been to expect the first episode to already make such a masterpiece of a series.
Yoshihiro Togashi, the amazing author behind Yu Yu Hakusho was limited his creativity on
                  Yu Yu Hakusho and where he could go with that story by his publishers. After abruptly ending the story, Togashi created a new story. That story is hunter x hunter, set in a world where being a Hunter is a job to perform a wide variety of tasks like capturing criminals, being a bodyguard, bravely searching for lost treasures and exploring the world to do simply whatever you want or are interested in. The main protagonist, 12 year old Gon Freecss wants to become the best Hunter in hopes of finding his father, Ging Freecss who had to put his son aside and abandon Gon Freecss to pursue his dangerous life as a hunter. Gon found out this reason as to why his father left him at such a young age and decides to become a hunter himself to answer his curiosity as to why his father came to such a decision to put his job over his own son. It is such a simple premise yet what happens later in the story is what makes this anime truly the best in my opinion
HxH contains 6 major arcs, that being the Hunter Exam Arc, Heavens Arena Arc, Yorknew City Arc, Greed Island Arc, Chimera Ant Arc and the Election Arc. The thing about HxH is that its arcs are connected with one another, with each arc continuing the one before it. This is great because it gives the series a sense of progression and isnt aimless and disconnected from its previous arc unlike in other stories or anime, it feels like a journey. HxH is very well paced for most of the series and does a very good job at making you feel engaged and entertained with the story. The only exception being the chimera ant arc, but by no means is the chimera ant arc horribly paced, it is just slower than the other arcs which are relatively faster in pace when compared to it. Hunter x Hunter barely has any filler either unless you include the 2 recap episodes which was surprisingly still entertaining to watch. It also doesn't contain pointless fanservice that wastes time and is very annoying. Due to this, you wont have trouble watching all the 148 episodes of hunter x hunter and wont even feel bored in any of the episodes. 
The fighting system nen, is also very complex fighting system. The whole thing works on a basic aura system which works like armor, can emphasize and show power, emotion and intent and with the option to manipulate the density and move it around. You can also change the change the characteristics and property of nen to make it into a something that mimics materials like metal or rubber etc. The fights are also very tactical and are very interesting and fun to watch. There is much more to say about nen but it is so detailed that it would take quite a while to list everything down. In summary, nen is a very complexed power system.
The animation and art style is really good and consistent throughout the series. Madhouse did a very good job with the anime adaptation.
the Sound, HxH offers a variety of different soundtracks, alot of them very enjoyable and it got better and better as the story progressed, with certain scenes accompanied by the most amazing of soundtracks which fit in with the current theme, tone, and atmosphere of each arc. Just listen to all the endings (especially reason by Yuzu, Hyori Ittai by Yuzu, Hunting for your Dream by Galneryus  the opening theme, departure by Galneryus just to name a few of arguably one of the best anime soundtracks i've ever heard. The voice actors also did a very good job overall at expressing emotion during the light hearted and the dark parts of the anime. Especially Megumi Han, the voice actor of Gon during the chimera ant arc acted and voiced her character REALLY well especially during the chimera ant arc, Daisuke Namikawa who voiced Hisoka (also voiced other characters such as oikawa), Mariya Ise, who voiced killua, and many others which just voiced and acted their character really well to set the tone to a particular scene really well.
The characters are also written really well, fleshed out properly to produce interesting character traits and are very unique. Characters like gon, kurapika and leorio have their own individual and separate goals, paths, challanges, objectives and dreams that they want to achieve. Their not your average 1 dimensional characters. Meanwhile killua, at first is clueless about what he wants to do and so follows gon for a while and feels inspired by him because gon, despite being thick headed, he somewhat knows and is focused on what he wants to do and achieve. Later on in the story, killua finally has a goal and his own thing he wants to do after being with gon for a while. It really was subtle, but wholesome how gon was able to somewhat change killua along the way. Their friendship definitely is easily one of the best in anime, an unforgettable duo. The antagonists are unique and interesting characters as well, hisoka, chrollo or meruem.
Conclusion:
Overall, I have to say, Hunter x Hunter is simply one of the best, if not the best anime. No, it’s definitely the best Anime I’ve seen so far and it won’t be easy to fill the void in my heart after finishing the series. If you're looking for a Shounen, which is outstanding and unique in terms of writing, story progression, character development, power system, and world building, you have to watch Hunter x Hunter. While it has some weaknesses here and there and rather mediocre episodes in some arcs, it doesnt heavily affect the series due to the overall extremely high quality and consistency as a whole present throughout the series.

                I want to give the unbiased rating here.
==============================================
SYNOPSIS
==============================================
Hunter x Hunter is a story about a boy named ""Gon Freecs"" who wants to be a hunter like his father, ""Ging Freecs"". He then start the journey to pass the hunter exam. In his journey, he met many friends: Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio, the the story flows around them and about finding his father.
The story might be separate into arcs and they are independent:
- Hunter Exam arc - 21 eps
- Zoldyck Family arc - 5 eps- Heavens Arena - 10 eps 
- Yorknew City arc - 22 eps
- Greed Island - 17 eps
- Chimera Ants - 61 eps
- Hunter Chairman Election - 12 eps
==============================================
WHY I DO LIKE IT?
==============================================
Because Yorknew City Arc (episode 40 -58) is great. The arcs is good because it consists of many twists and unpredictable moments. After seeing an episode, I just want to see another episode of Yorknew City Arcs. The villain are not just an ordinary villain, but also smart. Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio are joined together to hunt the enemies together and this make the arcs so interesting.
==============================================
WHY I DO NOT LIKE IT?
==============================================
Because the other arcs are really terrible and that make the whole anime not so good. In details are below:
1. At first I thought this is an anime about hunting, and focus on hunting. However it turns out to be more focus about ""super power"" thing like dragon ball anime at the later episodes.
So, a super villain appears -> main characters train -> main characters beat villain -> another super villain appears -> main characters train -> main characters beat villain -> loop forever.
2. 
Why do Gon want to be a hunter?? 
Why Killua want to be a hunter??
Why Kurapika and Leorio want to be a hunter?
I find the the reason to be a hunter is not realistic.
They actually can achieve the same result WITHOUT being a hunter.
(Don't misinterpret my sentence here. Gon want to find about his father by becoming hunter.. I know it seems logical for other viewers but not me. To find about his father, there are always another alternative!! The same goes to Kurapika, and Leorio. Money can always be got from somewhere else while being a hunter do not guarantee easy money. To get access to information, you always have a way, like borrowing license.)
The Hunter association itself is not really clear. What is the hunter job? May the bad people can be a hunter and misuse the hunter license? It is really a plot hole here.
And why Gon only want to find his father, not his mother also? Because he think because his mother is a female it might replace mito san?? So, It is because of gender reason???  that reason without a doubt make Gon an TRULY REALLY SELFISH RACIST character and I hate it.
3. Many episodes in this anime are too DRAGGING and BORING. Sometimes, I just watch 15 minutes of narrator explaining about super power thing. Sometimes, the narrator is too annoying, he explains too much detail and ruins the story.
For example, when a person is walking from A to B, the narrator said ""A is walking from A to B quietly"" which is not needed because the watcher can see it by ourselves.
Sometimes, the animation is replaced by a static picture with a narrator explaining. This ruins the arts.
The episodes about Gon and Killua training are also too long.
The super power is also unrealistic and too complicated.. Complicated one just make the story boringggg...
The conversation about super power is the one I avoid most, and it is almost 50% of the anime.. I don't need an explanation about A can have an aura 15 meters or the aura A can beat aura B and aura C can beat aura D with prerequisite and exception F, G, H...
==============================================
SUMMARY            6/10
==============================================
If the shows only consists Yorknew City alone, perhaps I will give rating 9. The other arcs is terrible and without Yorknew City arcs, I will give it 5 at best. So, I put an average here: 6.
If you like superpower anime like dragonball, or the law of ueki, you might like this one also. But, for me those animes are I avoid the most.",6
"
                This will be my first and thus my worse review, this anime was so painful it has driven me to make an account to let off some steam, sorry in advance.
Clearly there is a lot of high praise for this anime which for the recorded from the start I never understood. I completely ignored it for a long while which is standard, if your not interested you wont watch it. Then I saw the reviews and on top of this friends recommended it to me. At this point I thought I had just misunderstood and went ahead and watched 10 episodes. it was horrible, it
                  dragged and I dropped it even going against my 3ep rule. 
Now were here, I've forced myself to watch it all after constantly being told it would get good after 20 or so episodes, fair enough it did finally started to pick up at this point but barely and for what cost. the whole show seemed inconsistent with no group of episodes where an event had a climax.
lets talk about the 'story telling' this show had a horrible nack for struggling to build suspense where it clearly should be but throwing it all away once the next episode starts. this was first evident during the fight against the spider troupe and it was most evident in the ant arc against he king. 
I'd like to point out that the fight between the leader of the troupe and the clown guy was clearly hyped like something to finally look forward to and it was dropped just like that, its laughable how they could crush that suspense so easily. constantly things would be instigated and not take place. 
I felt like the story wanted to cover too many things at once, every move made by every character in all their individual conflicts, again most evident towards end. this is the source of the issue, this killed any suspense built in conflicts, once ground for a fight was made in once place it would be put on pause to start a new conflict elsewhere with a different character. it would cycle round and once it came back f**k all happens. the story needed more focus, I don't need to see every move made by all characters.
I called them conflicts because it was basically who ever had more tricks up their sleeve and was more prepared won. i can honestly say the only fight i enjoyed was the spider troupe arc when the big guy was killed. its funny because i expected the arc to only excel from that point with more interesting fights and WOW WAS I WRONG, it became this tedious waffle that dragged.
I have no structure for this review and I've failed to cover everything I'm angry but ill end it here. For the record I very much liked the character diversity and the development in relationship between Gon and Killua.
Overall I give this a 3, if you can't find interest in the first arc give up on this anime, it doesn't get much better.",3
"
                No matter how many times I watch all 148 episodes of the 2011 version of Hunter x Hunter, I always want to watch it again. Hunter x Hunter submerses you into a fun strand of adventures that two kids go on, all the while beating the  sh*t out of enemies left and right despite being 12 years old. However the characters don't find strength in friendship, but rather in hard work and TRAINING. The series finds ways to show the development of the characters' strength, without making them randomly OP for plot convenience, and better yet, they don't always win. They get injured, and
                  those injuries hinder them. Which makes creative solutions a common theme. 
    Where it lacks in an astonishing soundtrack, it makes up for in sheer involvement. If you are considering this anime, you should watch it. (Also Hisoka looks like less of a girly circus potato in the new one, and more like a hot pedefile. lmao.)",10
"
                I put off this anime for a couple months since it was 100 episodes over and I knew I was going try to binge it in less than a week, and man was I right. I'll be brief and try not to include in spoilers. This anime is incredible.The characters, throughout the arcs you get to see characters, both hero and villains go through so much character development by having a glimpse of their past,an insight on their goals in order to understand them, and lastly their struggle to reach it. The bond between some of them creates this powerful envionrment that shows each of
                  their weaknesses and ability to help each other. You also get to see them grow stronger as the story goes. I realized I found myself getting attached to these characters, always on edge as they risked their lives when dealing near death situations. Overall I caught myself smiling like an idiot at the screen most of the time . The story contains several conflicts that require mental and physical training, and it also doesn't revolve around just the MC. This is an anime that will leave you thinking I need more than 148 episodes.",10
"
                I am very very far from being some sort of anime reviewer or veteran, and you can tell by my list, but I just wanted to write something about this show since I think it's very great. Mostly writing for myself so keep that in mind.
For me, this show touched me on a deeply personal level and emotionally. There's barely any filler (2 recaps) but the show still manages to go 148 episodes strong with just the story. And let me tell you, the story is awesome, but I will not write too much about what the story is here since you have the mal
                  synopsis close at hand. Rather I will write about what I liked and what I disliked (pretty much nothing).
The arcs the story goes through are all really fleshed out and bring a very big cast of completely new characters, which all get a whole lot of development, and also some of the old characters that are there for one reason or another. All of the arcs felt very well paced and most of all extremely interesting. There was not one arc I didn't enjoy massively, they were all freaking amazing.
 The story also isn't just about Gon pursuing his dad the whole way through, It's more about friendship and the connections the characters make with each other. They go a long way to help each other out.
As I said before, the characters are all very fleshed out, but most of all they're all unique and creative. No character is even remotely the same as another. How one author could come up with such an ultra wide assortment of super creative characters with different personalities and different goals I can not understand. He's an absolute genius in my mind, since if you've ever tried writing a decently long story yourself, or just read/watch a lot of pretty long going stories, you'll know how important variety is. 
The two main characters that consistently appear throughout the story are the real nails that holds it all together though. Their friendship, their goals and their reasons never seized to entertain me and the whole way through there was always something new to learn about them that they also learnt about each other. Their backstories, up growing and family are pretty much polar opposites, which also makes it all very interesting.
As of writing this, I've ordered the first 5 volumes of the manga, and will definitely read it all and keep up with it (even though it's always on hiatus from what I've heard), but since the manga is not finished the anime had to have an anime original ending. Now, again, I'm no sort of anime veteran CLEARLY, but from what I've read, watched and heard anime original endings aren't the most beloved thing, and for good reason. The anime original endings aren't what the manga author intended and sometimes the anime original endings just suck ass. My strongest experience with this is fullmetal alchemist since I watched brotherhood and read the manga before watching the 2003 anime. When the 2003 anime aired the manga wasn't done and they made an anime original ending that those of you who have seen all know how that turned out. Pretty terrible depending on who you ask.
Luckily however, the anime original ending for hunter x hunter 2011 is very very good. It didn't feel unnatural or bad at all, the story made for it right there in the end was very satisfying to me. Now since I haven't read the manga, I have no idea how the are that is the end of the anime works there, maybe the manga doesn't even have the 13th chairman election, I have no idea. All I know is that the end to the anime fits right in perfectly.
For me this anime ties as my all time favorite with fullmetal alchemist brotherhood. I reaaaaally like these kinds of long shouldn't adventures that I can just get sucked into. And that also can keep the quality up. Hunter x hunter is 148 episodes and if you haven't watched it, trust me you won't regret it. It's all a blessing.
Only thing I think could've been better or is ""bad"" is that I wish it was longer. 148 is a lot of episodes, but this story definitely isn't completed yet. There are some plot points that I didn't feel were quite tied together yet (includes a certain hisoka) but I'm pretty sure they already happened in the manga or are about to. It's also extremely bad that the author of the manga is sick and can't write as much as both we and he would've liked. That's what puts the manga on hiatus and of course it just sucks that he's sick in general. My best wishes go out to him, hope he gets better.
But if we somehow ever get more of the hunter x hunter anime I will be the happiest boy alive.
I give it 10/10, go watch it, it's awesome!",10
"
                First of all, HunterxHunter isn't a ten outta ten anime, it's more like a 9,45
Doesn't have that, so I'll go for 10 'cause it's more than 9. That's it.
Now that I've put this out, time for the real review. And, yes, it have spoilers. Is impossible to review something in the way I do without spoiling things. Sorry.
Second advice: this review will be the bigger one I will ever wrote. Just read it if you have time to spare, 'cause I will review every story arc apart.
Third: All of this is MY OPINION, I AM NOT ASSUMING IT LIKE THE ONLY TRUTH, 'KAY?
Fourth: In the
                  end, will have just the scores, if you just want to know it.
Fifth: Have some curse words.
Story: 9,7
I'll review each story arc apart. First of all: The first episode, that doesn't belong to any arc, it's just the beggining, right? Wrong. It belongs to the first story arc: The Hunter Shiken.
We start the story meeting Gon Freecss, a young boi who wants do fish a really big fish. Even with a bunch of big strong men, the fish wasn't caught. But with one little boy who was wanting so much it was caught. Jk, it wasn't like that, actually, Gon is quite strong for his age, because he train everyday, trying to become a Hunter. Then, we go for the Hunter Exam arc, in the middle of ep1, after Gon caught his big fishy boi. For this part of the anime, I would give an 9, that's a sweet start for a battle shounen.
First Arc: The Hunter Exam (or Hunter Shiken, if you want it in japanese for some reason) Arc
Here we get to know Kurapika Kurita, Leorio, Killua, Gittaracku and Hisoka, basically the important characters that we should keep in mind. In this part of the story, I wasn't knowing what to expect, but dAMN BOI, it was amazing. We have action, strategy, psycological exploration and abilitys shown. And HOLY SHOOT, for a battle shounen, it really knows how to explore the psycologic part. Also Hisoka is a kinky bissexual pedophile who keeps an eye in Gon and Killua. I don't have any regrets with this arc. Perfect for the beggining.
Score for this arc: 10
Second Arc: Zoldyck Family (or Zoldyck kazoku, if you want in japanese for some reason) Arc
After the Hunter Shiken, Killua go back for Kukuroo mountain, the Zoldyck home. Who are the Zoldyck? Ansatsushi kazoku, or, a hitmen family, with a grandpa, a father, a mother and f*cking 5 kids. But we just get to know 4. And, of course, we have the servants. Gotoh, the main butler, basically sees Killua as his son, Canary, that have a not-so-secret crush in Killua, and another servants shown to us in this arc.
This whole arc is, basicaly, to show the difference between the Zoldyck family and other families, and show how weak our protagonists are. Even Kurapika looks like as strong as a baby when he is in Kukuroo mountain. But Killua is strong enough to stab his older brother (Milluki, the fat one) and dpo something like to his mother too. And run from them. Anyways, after some episodes of psycological exploration, our characters get back in a group and get out the mountain in a party of 4.
Score for this arc: 9, I wish we could've seen more of Gotoh in here.
Third Arc: Heaven's Tower Arc
After the thing that happenned in the past Arc, Killua and Gon go after some money. Killua knows exactly wherer to go. Heaven's Arena. They start fighting, go for 50th floor and meet a little boy, named Zushi and his master, Wing. Keep those two in mind. Nen is introduced and explained. And OH MY GOD, THIS MYSTICAL ENERGY IS SO FANTASTIC. There is 6 types of nen, and almost 10 BASIC ABILITIES, because you have to know how to do ALMOST EVERYTHING with nen to create your own ability. That's so insane, dood. Togashi is a genius. Nen is my favourite natural energy from all anime. Anyways, this arc is to show nen and its different usages. You can do barely anything with it.
And we have the two best fights in the anime: Hisoka vs Gon 2 and Hisoka vs Kastro.
Score for this arc: if I could give 11 I would. 10.
Fourth Arc: Yorkshin Arc
I am trying to write this part for 3 days now, and i can't do it. This arc is so perfect that i can only say the characters introduced here and nothing more, because all the other thing can be major spoilers, so, here I go.
Some bodyguards. One of them dies, I won't tell who. And we have to know the Mafia of this anime. And BOI. This mafia do their paper.
Score for this arc: if a 12 were possible, I would give it 14. 10.
Fifth Arc: Greed Island
DOOD, I don't know how to describe it, but, here I go:
Think this game like this: the SAO game and Yu-Gi-Oh in a mixer, you put out the good parts and mix it with cards doing things to human. Ta-dah! Greed Island. And Nen is usable inside! From now on, I can't tell anything more about the anime, major spoilers aren't good things. And someone please save the twins, they still are in there. Bisky is a good master. Razor is thICC BOI, and Hisoka is a filthy pedophile, Genthru is the devil in a human body, Tzesgera is tHICC too, and that's it. Watch the anime, for godsake.
Score fir this arc: 9. This arc would be better with some explanations, but still good.
Sixth Arc: Chimera Ants
This arc is something else. I won't tell anything about it. Just this: Pitou, Youpi, Pouf, Meruem, Komugi, Kaito and tears. Buckets full of tears. An ocean of tears. If you don't cry watching this you aren't a human being. That's it. WATCH IT.
Score for this arc: boi. Why can't we put 0-100 scores? It would be so easier to do this. 20 and beyond. WHY I CAN'T GIVE MORE THAN 10 TO THIS? WHYYYYYY? UGH. 10. Sad 10.
Seventh Arc: Next Hunter Association Chairman
We are in a freaking shonen. And there is politics envolved. Togashi don't know he is writing a shonen manga. For sure. And Cheadle probably is Gon's mother. Ging and her have a weird relationship, they could have some past togheter, I'd like it... Anyways, Leorio best character in this Arc.
Score for this arc: 10/10.
Art: 9,7 (I'll give it a 10)
The art is quite uniform, the characters look pretty and dAMN BOI, KILLUA'S EYES ARE THE PRETTIEST THING EVER. But the nose thing... UGH. It bothers me more than anything in this anime. I don't know why, but I feel unconfortable with it. But the backgrounds are BEAUTIFULL, the characters are BEAUTIFUL and the items like Kurapika's wooden sword and Leorio's case are something else. And I loved Gon's hair.
Sound: 9,8 (I'll give it a 10)
It would be a round 10. If the opening theme changed anytime. Nothing bad about departure, but... In all the 148 eps, the same opening theme, I started to unlike it some more.
But the japanese voice acting is the perfection. Pitou's scene, when Gon is so pissed off that he is yelling at Killua is so perfect, I get every single hair in me, even the hair on the places that the sun don't see, spiked. This seiyuu combined so much with Gon's style that I can't watch HxH with another audio. Just don't match.
Characters: 10
How can I explain all the characters with less words... Unique and creative. Every single one have different abilities and nen usage. Every single one have it's own persoanlity. Every single one with a different look. And, of course, we have Meruem and Pitou. The ones who fought to protect someone, when the humans were fighting to kill. This is simply amazing.
Enjoyment: 10
I simply loved the anime, and I will read the manga too. I have high hopes on the manga. Anyways. My favourite female character after Jirou Kyouka (from Boku no Hero Academia) is from here: Neferupitou. And my favourite antagonist too: Meruem. And one of the characters that I hate the most is from here too: Shaiapouf. In other words, the Chimera Ant arc is perfect, the best shonen arc.
Overall: 10.
I told you all I can tell about this without changing ou experience too much. I guess that's it. Kisses and hugs. Bye ~

                (SPOILERS)
I gave this a shot when I checked the MAL top rankings and saw it was on the website's top 5. I decided why not try the series and binged the show in a month. This is one of the animes I initially stayed away from because I thought it was just a generic shonen anime about a kid and having a simple adventure with his friends; boy was I completely wrong. Don't let the childish appearances discourage you from watching this legendary anime.
Story:
The story is pretty standard in the beginning but it slowly changes into something phenomenal. Here it revolves around Gon and his
                  group of friends: Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio. Gon seeks out his father at a young age and embarks on a wild journey from there on. Gon meets various friends and enemies along his journey to seek out his father but many challenges await him in the meantime. 
Hunter x Hunter is comprised of various well written and critically acclaimed arcs in shonen history. Two of the most notable are by far the Chimera Ant arc and the Yorknew City arc. These two arcs define the series as a whole in my opinion because its where the characters are the most fleshed out and developed. Meruem, Chrollo, and Hisoka alone are contenders of the best antagonists of all of anime. 
Art:
The art is spectacular as expected from Madhouse. It is really well done for an anime made in the early 2010's. It seems like it was made in like 2018 or something along those lines. The studio also went all out on the fights too. Kurapika vs. Uvogin, Gon vs. Hisoka, and especially Netero vs. Meruem were some of the best fights i've seen in anime. They all flow so smoothly and are paced really well. My favorite visual is probably Neferpitou's abilities and powers.
Sound:
The sound is superb in my opinion. The OSTs, Openings (even though they're all the same lol), and Endings are absolutely fire. The Chimera Ant arc utilized the soundtrack to the maximum to intensify the scenes. The palace invasion was a prime example of this, and even knov's brave attempt to invade the palace also had a eerily scary theme. 
Character:
Characters in Hunter x Hunter are nothing short of extraordinary. The cast is absolutely lovable and their writing just amplifies your love for them even more. When it comes to battle shonen, most of them have very poor characters or don't utilize their characters to their fullest extent, safe to say, Hunter x Hunter does not follow this theme. The characters go through pain, anguish, sacrifice, and sorrow to achieve their goals. For example, Gon had to sacrifice his usage of nen during the Chimera Ant arc to defeat Neferpitou and get revenge for Kite, this sole objective was enough to push Gon over the edge and literally ""use everything."" Or even Kurapika's desire to destroy all of the Phantom Troupe for slaying his clan. He carries the weight of his fallen friends and family on his back. He is willingly risking his life to search out and seek these Troupe members. His ability is solely for fighting the Troupe members, and that shows dedication to his true goals. Also as I mentioned previously in my story section of this review, Hunter x Hunter boasts some of the best antagonists in anime. Hisoka and Chrollo are amazing but in my opinion, Meruem is a different beast. His parallels to Gon are absolutely stunning. It showcased how Meruem was gaining his humanity while being with Komugi and how Gon was slowly becoming a monster due to him sacrificing everything to defeat Pitou. Meruem showed compassion, fear, happiness, pain, and everything else you can think of. He was someone you couldn't help but feel bad for and feel compassion for in the end.
Enjoyment:
I thoroughly enjoyed Hunter x Hunter. It kept me wishing for more episode after episode and always had me on the edge of my seat on some episodes. The fight scenes were intense and hype, the music made the atmosphere crazy, and the characters were cool as hell. I forgot to mention this but Hunter x Hunter has the best power system in anime in my opinion. The way Nen is used in this series is truly unique since it applies differently to every person. Nen to put it simply, is life energy that is controlled by the person. We've seen super distinctive uses of Nen in this show, like Chrollo's, Kurapika's,Kite's, Hisoka's, Neferpitou's, etc. I love this power system in general because it can be infinitely used in different ways, so that it can be left up to the watcher to decide what Nen can be imagined. 
Overall:
Overall I loved Hunter x Hunter from start to finish. I don't think any show will top this for me in a long time. It is just pure perfection in my eyes. It's crazy to think that this show started off as a young child just searching for his father but later spiraled out of control into a series of amazing events. Nonetheless, I am glad I watched this show to witness Togashi's masterpiece writing.

                I just finished this anime and it has left me a bittersweet feeling about it and that's a strong indicator that I throughly enjoyed Hunter X Hunter. This anime really contained everything I love about a wonderful anime and it is nothing short of a masterpiece from art, character development, story telling, sound and music...etc and also lots of slice of life moments.
This anime have episodes full of 'feels' and give you nuggets of the joys and sorrows of life. I love that it is a fantasy but it feels very down to earth do to all the slice of life moments. The story lines
                  and characters are so rich and full of history. I was a bit surprised to discover how mature some of the topics and themes that were in this anime such as war, separation,  politics, death, corruption, anguish, depression and all the negative / evil aspects that you would find in any world. However, I realized that you really can't have the intense 'joy' that the story goes through without deep sorrow/negative aspects in a story. The main Character Gon is portrayed very mature as well in which I get that you have to in order to have a story such as this. 
Friendship is a huge theme that runs through the entire story. You have friendship and love not only within the main characters but supporting characters and antagonist as well. The friendship and love will move you to tears when there is a strong display of compadre-ness and connectivity. Then, there is also forgiveness, and sacrifice and acts of love that trenscends all the evilness in the story and shows you that love can conquer all. 
Slice of life aspect is strong with this anime. I love slices of life anime. Many Disney and successful movies all have this aspect because it makes the story a million times more relatable and teach or remind you life lessons that you learn in your lifetime such as the life lesson Gon's father wanted to not only 'teach' but 'show' his son Gon. The lessons are going to not only going to give Gon a fulfilled life (life full of adventure, joy, fun etc) but also give Gon a goal ' meaning to Gon's life. Ging - Gon's father, wanted to show Gon what he, Ging, was passionate about in life and in turn give Gon a chance to discover Gon's own passion. Although in this story, it didn't show too much of it but it did shed light on Killua's life goals.
I always say it is not only the goals that are important but the journey as well. The journey has to be important as the goal if not more important and that's something so simple yet complex, so very crucial for us humans to grasp the meaning of our lifes. Ging really wanted Gon to live his life to the fullest despite not knowing, despite not reaching sometimes the end goal but enjoy the journey... very Carpe diem - seize the day - live life to the fullest type of deal which just highlighted the positive feeling that makes this anime such a good 'feel good' anime that you would want to write a review about lol.
Personally, I don't watch anime this long (148 episodes)... I find it hard to commit to such long anime sometimes it becomes an arduous task if the series is too long. However, this I very enjoyable. The anime is broken into 3 or 4 large arcs and a central story line... It makes the anime lot easier to enjoy and at the end of the story you feel like you went on an adventure of a lifetime alongside of Gon!",10
"
                *spoilers*
I'll start off by saying this...although it has plenty o' episodes, it still manages to leave the viewer with so many questions. At least it does for me. I love how the story went, its pacing, its character development, it's drama/tension, everything. The story was composed of 3 arcs. First one->the hunter exam, second->greed island PLUS the tower, and last one->chimera ants. The first two i quite enjoied. (1)The 3rd one had it's flaws tbh. Being the major/biggest arc in the story i was expecting more. I don't like how the king died, i don't like how Netero died, i don't like how Pitua was
                  basically killed with ONE punch after a tension build of over 40 episodes. That wasn't even a battle. It was just a ""power overwhelming"" situation. And let's not talk about the other 2 royal guards. Pouf and Youpi...they died w/o a fight. They just...died. I know they had to give most of their life essence to revive Meruem but still, lame way to die. Youpi died literally coughing and Pouf died in the middle of the road cuz the king ain't the mindless murderer he wanted him to be.
(2)What happened to Spider villains? After being the main antagonists for the first half of the show they just...vanished. No story what-so-ever.
(3)The last 10 episodes were a mess. I get that they had to keep the plot armor on Gon but they didn't even tried to hide it. And POW Gon is back to life miraculously.(4)Kurapika was presented as a protagonist but he ( and Leorio for that matter ) hasn't played in the show for a good 90 episodes. Again, he vanished and got revenge, God knows how.
(5)The main story was about Gon searching his father, good pacing up until end of chimera ants arc. His father didn't even want to see him. His real goal is to find the ""other world"".
(6)They don't mention ANYTHING about Gon's real mother.
(7)At the end of the show Killua went in a world trip with his sister. So far so good. Where is Gon tho? Kiilua embarked Gon's lust for family reunion but Gon said "" fk it, i want to see my father even tho he doesn;t give a fk about me "". Ok. You saw him, you spoke with him, he's going on his own path, now why didn't you go with Killua?
(8) What is up with Hisoka?Why did he wanted to keep Gon alive? What happened to him in the end?Why there was no fight between him and Chrollo? Again, like everyother thing that wasn't finished, he just got punshed under a blanket. Noibody knows anything about him. Was he a bad guy? A good guy? Those are the major 8 problems(that i can remember) that bothered me thruout the show.",10
"
                So, this is my first review I hope it helps you...
Don't get fooled by the cover. It may seem as the typical shounen anime where they just fight, have the common themes as fighthing for your comrades, friendship or never giving up. This anime goes way more deep into those topics. They tackle every issue possible in this anime. What I really liked about this anime is that even though it has different arcs, they never get boring and one arc leads to the other one. So, this anime is not an episiodic one, it takes you to a story where the characters that appear
                  blend well into the story as well as their fights or problems. 
The best thing that I find in this anime is that they have realistic characters and one of the best character developments you can find (Killua). It does not have the typical shounen protagonist who is flawless and never tumbles. All of the four main protagonists are unique with their own flaws and strenghts. What I really want to point out is Killua, I think he is one of the most beautiful personalities in the whole anime world, you can say he starts as cold, bad an evil but later on in the whole anime, he starts to be aware of the good things this world has and even appreciate himself and accept that he is a better person. Also, some characters can have the other effect, Kurapika for example, even though he started as the noble character he starts to crush himself in order to get to his goal. 
This anime shows you that, everyone is like that because they had a REASON to be it like that. The bad guy has a reason to be the bad guy and the good guy has a reason to be the good guy. There's no bad nor good guy who just pops out to be like that, everyone has their own reasons and that's why they are pretty realisitic. 
To conclude, you will definetily not be dissapointed if you see this anime. I'm sure is gonna be one hell of a ride!! You won't regret it",10
"
                STORYTELLING & ARCS: Storytelling was the highlight of the show undeniably. A lot of things keep on happening around and best part was how Gon & Killua were involved in those. The arcs in particular served no definitive highlights to their characters (with Greed Island and Heaven's Arena as an arguable exception) & that's what made the storytelling so unique to me. The stories weren't focused on them but rather had them. And yet, the characters' progression were never hindered for once. The depth and layers as well as continuous change of themes and tone in the storytelling proved to be the vital point of
                  the show.
CHARACTER & THEIR DESIGNS: Almost each and every characters of the show played some key roles throughout the show. No characters can be deemed useless. And the amount of development the major characters recieved throughout the journey of 148 episodes was a delight to experience. Gon, Kurapika, Meruem & Killua, in particular, were highlights of the show with Hisoka lurking around the favourites-corner. Besides, when it comes to designs, Madhouse did yet another fantastic job. Killua, Gon & Hisoka's designs in particular were some huge improvements from its source material or first anime adaptation. Maybe, only the Zodiacs didn't look as good as others.
ART & ANIMATION: Art-style was a fantastic upgrade over its inconsistent source material and overall, both animation & art were consistent enough. Although, they can't be deemed fabulous or anything. They were just good, or great for a long running show that Hunter x Hunter was. While the art managed to capture the vast world building so extravagantly with a beautiful color palette, the shot composition and animation added a different dynamism that made the show a beautiful piece of art to watch and enjoy. The animation, however, became extremely good during certain moments such as the fight between Gon & Hisoka. Besides some fantastic choreography, the shot composition and clever usage of budget also allowed the fights to look great.
MUSIC: Probably the most underrated aspect of the show. The theme song and almost every ending themes were consistently great. I never skipped any one of the openings or endings at all! Such was the obsession I had with the show in itself. Besides, backgrounds scoring added a different feeling to the show. Originally, Hunter x Hunter is a very dark manga. But most importantly, with (the color palette and) the music, Madhouse succeeded in giving the show a brand new dimension. But that didn't hinder the quality, epicness or darkness of certain moments or the penultimate arc. A true shounen. 
POWER-SCALING: Nen is usually considered one of the finest power-systems ever & I can understand why. It was never about the brute force but rather the brain. Intelligence > Power was always showcased with Hisoka & Killua as the leading examples. With bunjee gum or godspeed, a loss is inevitable unless you adapt and apply yourself properly on ground. Nen truly played an important role throughout the series with a huge surprise in the end where human's raw evolution was shown to be not forgotten amid.
PACE: Pace was pretty consistent throughout with Greed Island, Heaven's Arena & Yorknew City Arcs being perfect. But the problem arose with the beginning of Chimera Ant Arc that was painfully slow at times. In the end, the slow pace also made sense and only enhanced the arc further to provide a satisfying finish. Overall, I'd say the pace was pretty good, if not that great.
VOICE ACTING: I watched the English dub and it was simply flawless to begin with. Every voices suited their respective characters ideally with Hisoka, Killua, Gon & Leorio being the best performances of the entire show. At times, I felt the English dub was much superior to its Japanese counterpart in my honest opinion (which is quite surprising nowadays, with the exception of Black Clover arguably).
MOVIES: Probably the only ""disappointing"" aspect of the entire show. First movie was mediocre and second movie was just good at best. In the end, nothing matters given the movies are totally non-canon.
DIRECTION: Now that I've talked about everything, I must admit — the series wouldn't have anywhere near what it is if it wasn't for the direction. The series had 2 fillers in total with some good pace, fabulous arcs, great action, fantastic shot composition & what not. The direction itself needs applause seperately. 
VERDICT: Overall, what I feel like is that no episode was ever less than a solid 8/10 for me & such was the enjoyment I've had over the last few months. I was invested very deeply into the anime & loved every bits of it. A pure masterpiece in every way. Probably could be the epitome of shounen once Togashi comes out of the hiatus and finishes the storyline. Although, it's still very hard to convince people to watch it given the shounen tag (which some people don't like anymore) as well as the misleading and generic synopsis. But trust me, the series is nowhere near what its impression otherwise feels like.
FINAL RATING: 10/10 easily. Just dive into it & have a blast of a few weeks. You'll not regret. Currently having a hangover & have no wish to watch anything else right now. Undoubtedly my most favourite anime alongside Vinland Saga!",10

                Please note this a review based on the first 50 episodes, so please keep that in mind.
Story 8: The story of HunterxHunter is quite competently made, taking many of the shounen tropes we have all seen and heard a hundred times and polishing them to a sheer shine till they are nigh unrecognizable, allowing for a new sense of excitement and enjoyment that is lacking in many other action/battle anime. However, the true joy of the narrative structure is how grounded it all is. Many of the problems the characters face are handled in a realistic manner and are explored throughly in order to make
                  even the most ridiculous situation feel more grounded. This in turn allows the narrative to feel more possible and more grounded, which only makes the moments of earth shattering power and dynamics that are present in the combat even more impactful. Whats surprising however is how this show keeps your attention even when in comparison to other shounen, it has remarkably few fights. An entire arch could pass, spanning 10-12 episodes, with maybe 3 or 4 fights among them and each fight only taking up to 1 or 2 episodes. Yet it still is able to fully hold your attention and keep you on the edge of your seat because of how well structured its narrative and world are.  Now, while the story is absolutely solid, it isnt a masterclass, suffering from some minor hiccups that are hard to ignore. The most prominent being that, at times, it suffers from the 'reactive protagonist' problem, where the cast only moves forward, progressing the plot, because some outside force has compelled them into doing so, thus reducing the agency of the character in question. This however, only occurs twice in the 50 episodes ive seen, and the show more than makes up for it with its in depth characterization scenes and its unique approach to world building. 
Art 8: On first glance Hunter x Hunter does not look remarkable, maybe even mediocre in its art. This however is a trap meant to lower your expectations because holy shit when the animation is solid IT IS SOLID! With fights that are both well choreographed and blindingly fast this series gives an excellent cross between the ""light speed exchange"" of DBZ, and the ""strategic counter play"" featured in the classic Naruto. In all honesty, the speed and flow of the combat is unlike anything I have seen in shounen. The art in these moments is truly spectacular, accentuating every little detail to make it as visually impressive, fast, and, most importantly, coherent as possible. It also has a great use of lighting, punctuating each scene with a mood that permeates every second. Its only fault i'd say is that some of the sets early on (like up to episode 10ish) can look slightly off at times, feeling a bit like a painting in the background, while still rare it should be taken into account. Also, the speech animation is pretty standard, which doesnt really detract from the show as a whole (with like 1 or 2 exceptions), but still should be recognized. 
Sound 9: I was surprised by how much I loved the sound design in this series, but god damn do I, its fucking excellent. From the fast and well paced op that, while not brain bustingly amazing, is competently put together to fit in with the video played with it, to the surprisingly diverse and unique scores that are scattered across the series, this series is exceedingly well done in its audio quality. Whats more shocking isnt that its audio and music is so good its that the creator uses it so sparingly. Where most anime bombard the viewer with specific noises associated with a certain mood in every single episode in order to condition the viewer to have a certain response (think of bleach's jazz lady music), Hunter X Hunter differs because it uses these kinds of music quite rarely. Instead using them only to punctuate a truly intense or impactful moment, using them either to express a moment of rising terror or to give a pay off to a climactic moment. Unlike most actions series most of the time tension is built through complete, or near complete, silence. Many episodes feature almost no music at all, relying instead on ambient noise to set the mood and build tension. Some episodes go one step further and just mute the sound all together in a scene, causing you to feel a sudden intensity that just makes what would have been a good scene and turns it into excellence. One episode even goes for almost 10 min with only the most minimal of audio, featuring long moments of complete silence, and let me tell you, that is easily one of the most intense things I have ever seen or heard in all of shounen. 
Character 9: The characterization in Hunter x Hunter is again quite solid. However, it develops the cast in a way that is pretty unique compared to other shounen. Unlike most shounen stories, or action stories in general, the characters are independent of modern ideas of morality, and hold themselves to a standard all their own. Sure they fight for friendship and yada yada, but extortion, bribery, theft, torture, murder, rendering someone possibly disfigured for the rest of their entire life are only a couple things that the characters in this show do, and the characters express awareness of magnitude of these actions. However, what makes this great is that each character has a different view on said action, and whether the action is ok or not, and the show in turn has a mature discussion on matters of morality through these conflicts. I could exposit on how the characters are well rounded or how the blonde guy is pretty much sasuke (and how making him a supporting character and not the main rival was a genius choice so that he doesnt grate the nerves) or how glasses doesnt get to do...well...much of anything, but thats not what I want to harp on about. I instead want to express my love for how this set of characters regardless of its flaws are really likable, relatable, and have a dynamic that just makes so much sense (which let me say, is a great breath of fresh air). For example, the two main characters come from vastly different backgrounds and in turn have different experience, so unlike say naruto, where the protag just does it his way and every one just kind of goes with it and tells him he's a moron later on, but really he's somehow still the greatest even though he doesnt really listen to anyone for half the series, this show recognizes the difference in experience and the cast acts accordingly. Kuja, the more combat and worldly experienced of the group, often directs the group and makes plans, giving advice on how to deal with a situation before they begin. Gon, who is more experienced with human interaction, and with nature often takes the lead when it comes to talking to others or when it comes trying to deal with issues concerning nature. Honestly, I could go on all day on this matter, but needless to say each character is well developed and meshes well with each other to make a great dynamic.
Enjoyment 8: Hunter x Hunter is an excellent series that leaves you on the edge of your seat in even the dullest moments, and while it is still a pretty standard shounen action series, it is a damn good shounen action series that is far above the likes of the big 3. The characters, art and sound direction are all melded to make an experience that is both thoughtful, and intense in nature. It is a well developed piece of pop corn entertainment that has just enough depth to get you thinking, but not enough to force upon an existential self reflection.
Overall 8.5: When it comes down to it, this series is the pinacle of its genre, and will give you a constant sense of nostalgia, from Naruto and Bbleach, to DBZ, Yu Yu Hakushon and even Jo Jo's Bizzare Adventure, this story has something that is present in all shounen, and wether it was inspired by, or further inspired them, the series takes all the best elements  and makes a strong effort to utilize them to their fullest, and I can say that it succeeds without a doubt. This series is an excellent example of what a great shounen can be and should be noted as the benchmark in which we judge all other action anime. It really is just that good. So if you enjoy action/battle anime you owe it to yourself to watch Hunter x Hunter (2011).",8
"
                Definitely not your typical manga/anime, Hunter X Hunter does surprise. It has plenty of action, comedy, and gut wrenching elements to keep you wanting more. 
The story is unique compared to other shonen jump manga, and is very enjoyable. Some of the artwork may be disappointing, but it was amazing for its time. Although the sound is levels beyond even some newer anime of the 2010's. The characters have diverse backgrounds, and have unique strengths, which makes it amazing. 
It is much more enjoyable than you would think and I highly recommend it. Hunter X Hunter is worth watching.

                1. Yorknew City Arc - On my top 5 arcs of all time.
2. Chimera Ant Arc - Also one of the best arcs ever. But people seem to have preferences for it.
3. Nen - The best battle system in shonen, no contest.
4.Amazing villains/side characters - Hisoka, Chrollo, Meruem…
5. Substantial amount of character development for the main cast and mostly all 
significant characters in each arc. Beautifully written…
One thing I will say, I was hooked since episode 1, but it seems to be slow paced for some people, especially during the first few episodes where it sets the pace, and in the beginning of some arcs.
                  So just be patient.
Honestly it was hard to just come up with 5 reasons. The show is just a masterpiece. I feel like if it weren’t for the hiatus’s it would probably be considered the best shonen of all time. If only there was more content.. :(",9
"
                I've been an HxH fan ever since the first one from 1999 started. I was hooked, I first watched this as a kid on an afternoon time slot on the TV. There were no ending so I was curious and first thing I know, when I got a computer was to search and watch it full. If was unfinished until this 2011 got released.
From the normal Gon Freecss in the island with his Auntie/Mom and Granny, whom by then wanted to be a hunter to find his Dad. He made a deal with the pole in his hand that if he catch the big monster
                  fish on the lake, he will be allowed to take the hunter exam. Gon heading to the hunter exam, to Greed Island was one of my favorite arcs, then he met Killua, Kurapika, Leorio and some other hunters who played with him, took care of him, helped him and attacked him.
I was satisfied when the hunter exam is finished and he got his license, too bad Killua couldn't get it the first time because he got into trouble, but it was all worth it when he got his.
It couldn't get any better when Komugi, Meruem, Pitou, Poof and Youpi got into action. Kite who was killed and made a puppet by Pitou got Gon angered and frustrated. The action scenes in here as well as Gon's transformation that led to his near death experience, I felt like I was the one dying.
Overall, I'm satisfied... And I will keep repeating it when I miss them.
And surely, I won't get tired of it no matter how many times I repeat it.
I purely recommend this anime, and you will not regret watching it.",10

                Story:
I just finished watching all 148 episodes and it amazed me. It was a masterpiece for me as it promotes the enjoyful adventures of the main character, Gon Freecs battling through thick and thin to find his father Ging Freecs. The arcs are separated and well-written into several arcs which kept the audience to never stop wondering what kind of situation Gon and his friends dealing with and how they tackle their problems. The fighting scenes are well done and it keep giving me the Shounen vibes that I'm craving for. 
Art:
The art that Madhouse Entertainment used are top notch and the quality are consistent
                  throughout the series. The background fits every scene in the anime and it is pleasing in the eye. The movements and facial expressions are on point with the dialogues and it is hard to criticize the perfect artwork done by Madhouse Entertainment.
Sound:
The opening theme song gets better and better as the episode progresses. It is encouraging that Madhouse is serious in giving us the best soundtrack and it connects us with the situation the characters are in. The Seiyuus had done great jobs in expressing the dialogues and they fit extremely well with the characters. 
Character:
HxH has a very huge cast of characters. Each of the characters are well-written and likeable in their own way. I like Kurapika because of the strong resilience and the strong will he shows throughout the series. Gon meanwhile gives us the cheerful, hardworking and talented person that willing to go far for his friends. The development of Gon are done in slow, precise and detail manner so that the viewers understands the fun behind the adventures of Gon.
The villains in HxH are unique and it is difficult for us to hate them. They are well-portrayed and they keep reminding us the danger that comes around if you are messing with them. The facial expressions done by protagonists can be the indicator for the level of danger emitted by all the villains. It is very fun to watch the way the villains act and toy around the protagonists.
Negatives:
The explanation of Nen is quite confusing and you need to keep rewinding so that you can get the clear view of the power and what it can do the characters. Other than that, all seems perfect to me.
Overall:
I would like to say this anime is a masterpiece and I highly recommend you all to watch it.  It is currently the best Shounen anime I've watched so far and I rate this higher than any Shounen anime. The storyline is outstanding and you won't be disappointed.

                Hunter x Hunter (2011) boasts of a high mean rating to grab one of the top spots of the rankings of MAL, and while I can most definitely say that the mean rating does not necessarily reflect the quality of the show, having that good impression kinda reflects how a lot of people actually loved the series, for reasons we may or may not know. And I gotta say that HxH did well in proving how it deserves such a good score, and why people would actually become attached to what it can offer. While it followed certain stereotypical ""shounen formulas"" (and it did well
                  in that matter), HxH was able to present intelligent and hard-worked storytelling which when combined with unforgettable characters, amazing story arcs and settings, and great fluidity and logic, was able to form a masterpiece people would probably take a lifetime to forget.
Dividing the entire series into arcs, the dominant style of plot building in HxH is more or less typical of a shounen (and yep, I'm talking here despite having watched only a little of shounen) - it progressively creates its plot from recency, and in a linear manner, builds the story along with the plot events occurring. It does not build its story from puzzle pieces of the past, and rarely hints about some unknown big event in the future to happen. For every story arc, it shows you what it wants, and how the story would progress depends on how the characters in that arc make decisions and take actions, and similarly gives out the facts and information when the plot needs to bring them up. Simple and straightforward - the standard way of storytelling for shounen, I believe. While this is commendable as it makes the story very comprehensible and understandable, I feel that this way of storytelling is challenging because of two things. First is that it risks having an underdevelopment of the plot, like some crucial pieces of events may be disregarded and unexploited, and some details may be trivialized. Moreover, since this kind of storytelling needs to be divided into arcs, the flow of story transition must be coherent and logical; two adjacent yet separate story arcs need to make sense and should not feel forced because the straightforward way of presenting the story makes it hard to proceed to another story arc without compromising the fluidity and without changing the style of storytelling. These two problems are visible in most shounen anime with the same formula as HxH, which is why I really do not enjoy these kinds of shows really much - not to mention my preference to anime plot with a lot of foreshadowing and hinting (screw SAO, I love it for so many unknown reasons).
Guess what? HxH had me interested and hooked the entire time I was dealing with the ""straightforward"" plot building. The plot, which I mentioned to be risked of getting underdeveloped, was totally developed to the best it can - the key is to make each story arc count and conceptualize it like it was the last thing the story writer would make in his entire life. Each story arc had a lot of shit going on; the arcs definitely aren't boring, they were literally amazing. Each arc was well-thought of, and completely concluded with a blast. The adventure element was definitely there, the plot for each arc forces the characters to involve themselves with the story; it wasn't stagnant. The characters were absolutely memorable and realistic, I almost wanted to become a pro Hunter myself. In addition, what complements well with the straightforward way of storytelling is the vivid and detailed narration of what is currently going on, which started and was emphasized in the later arcs. It was new to me, but it was able to exhaustively provide logical and intelligent explanations to so many stuff, like battle strategies and techniques (the battles are so EPIC), reflective thinking of the characters and the like. What I also liked about it is that it gave the viewer an insight as to what is going on in the head of the other seemingly unimportant characters, making me relate more to them and expanding character development a whole lot better. It is also worth mentioning how HxH discussed heavily different real-life themes like friendship, politics, religion, philosophical issues and the like. It proves how HxH desires to expand its world and covered a lot of different themes imaginable. Moreover, while I said that there is a possible difficulty of making the story logical and coherent and fluid as possible, I felt that the story transition from one arc to another was absolutely amazing, it didn't feel like it was forced for the heck of it. The thing with HxH is that the conclusion of each preceding story arc introduces a problem which of course is related with the preceding story arc, but at the same time becomes a great introduction for the succeeding story arc, without giving the impression of forcing the story and while sticking to the original way of storytelling.
Another interesting thing I want to point out is that aside from the absolute extremes in the world of HxH, the series also discussed ""gray areas"" in certain matters. Protagonists are not entirely for the ""justice of humanity and saving the world crap"", instead they present real personal motivations and intentions they need to achieve, and I'm not talking about just fulfilling their long-held dreams; they also include stuff as revenge and other gray areas of real life. In the same manner, antagonists have their own intentions of doing evil actions, and it is literally amazing for HxH to discuss how these villains reflect on their own doings; it gives the viewer more avenues of knowing more of their true character, thus creating more attachment to these villains. Most of these are so badass I almost felt sympathy for them or I almost felt that their actions are justified. Then there are those of pure evil, it annoys me so damn much. Of course these things are present in so many other anime, typical from those with serious and seinen themes, but I feel that it is astounding coming from a shounen, because even if it seemed like it deviates from the typical shounen formula, it surprisingly complemented by making the storytelling more effective and more realistic, without compromising what lies best in a shounen.
The animation is also literally amazing in my opinion, each important character had outstanding designs and outfits, especially the villains in my opinion. The fight scenes were some of the best I've ever seen. What also amazed me more is the fact that HxH didn't stick with the typical ""when I shout or I reflect about my struggles I get stronger"" of many other shounen. Because as much as I wanted to appreciate the feels, I think it's still bullshit to some extent. The battles of HxH weren't anything like that, everything was based on careful planning and judgment of those involved, and they were a blast. The soundtracks were also a masterpiece in my opinion, I kept finishing them for every episode; they were damn memorable.
Why was HxH a 9 instead of a 10? It was a matter of preference, I'd say. The kind of story building HxH offered wasn't really my thing, but they did it pretty well. There were also some arcs that were kinda slowly paced to me, although how those parts ended were satisfying as fuck. There were also some parts left hanging, and I expected so much from the conclusion of those details. Exceeding expectations of an average viewer and falling short on minor details, it definitely deserves a good well-earned 9.
*insert some memorable HxH quote here because it apparently sounds appealing as a conclusion*
FUCK IT. I LOVE HUNTER X HUNTER.",9

                Undeniably it is a masterpiece. Though whenever I tried to recommend this anime to my friends, I have to start with saying ''basically it is about a kid looking for his dad and the journey starts, first he attends the hunter exam....'' and BANG, people started to ask me shut up at this point. Alright I know the plot of HXH sounds so childish, but just wait a second and give it a try. I am certain it will amaze you in less than 10 episodes, at least before the hunter exam is finished. The relationships (mainly friendship) between the main characters, the setting of
                  the hunter world, the battle of wits during Greed Island and the kidnap. This is the ONLY anime I can never put of feelings into words. You've got to watch it, feel it by yourself, and I can assure you the enjoyment at the hunter world is unique compared to other anime. 
HXH - details more stunning than the plot itself. Believe it. I loved it when I was 13, and I am still watching the manga and re watching the anime now (I am currently 28).",10

                I don't normally watch long anime because it takes me a long time. Last time I did it, I almost dropped everything I was doing just to watch it. And I only did so again just because my friend was. 
So the 2011 Hunter x Hunter series was a series that my friend wanted me to watch, as he was going to start watching as well. We wanted an anime that we BOTH were going to watch at the same time, and HxH was chosen. 
Honestly I'm glad I watched this anime and don't regret it at all. The story pacing from the very beginning
                  was fast and did not stick around the boring set-up for long, although I will admit we don't exactly know a lot about Whale Island and it's inhabitants other than Gon's family. 
Soon from the first episode, we are introduced to both Leorio and Kurapika, who both have their intentions of taking the exam, revealed from the get-go. We don't take long to try to figure out who in the world is this person and why he's here. 
We later meet Killua at the First Phase, and he quickly becomes friends with Gon due to them being the same age. They get along quickly and stay friends throughout the entirely of the series. 
Ging is one interesting person. He leaves his son behind just so he can become a Hunter, which later he apparently ""planned"" that Gon would become a Hunter himself, and set up a whole bunch of people to meet him and make his son stronger. I was a little pissed at him during the Chairman Election Arc though, but Leorio had that handled for me. Thanks Leorio! 
The entire plot of the series flowed to the next perfectly. We had our characters have some sort of ""reason"" to make it to the next arc, without any  needless filler. After the Exam arc, our characters go their separate ways and promise to meet in Yorknew City, which leads to the Heaven's Arena arc while alliterating what Satotz had wanted to say before, but was unable to. We were all left wondering what it was, and that was that Hunters need to learn Nen in order to be a full-pledged hunter. Kurapika is able to learn it in time to defeat a member of the Troupe in Yorknew City, the city in which Greed Island was being auctioned. 
With the Troupe no longer a threat, Gon and Killua head into Greed Island, which Gon learns more of his father. They head to where they think Ging is, only to find Kite instead, who was studying the Chimera Ants, which would eventually lead into a war with the Ants, especially the King and his Royal Guards. With the Ants defeated, peace returns and an expedition to the Dark Continent begins.
The whole story flows like it's just one plot line, which each arc containing clues to what's to come in the next arc. 
This series is definitely worth the watch!",10
"
                I don't understand why I haven't heard much about this anime until now, because this anime is quite simply amazing. 
This anime blew me away. This anime was so fantastic that I watched the entire thing in about a month. This anime has everything I have EVER wanted in an anime, and having watched it, I think I can confidently conclude that I will never find an anime that will top it. 
This anime has EVERYTHING. It has amazing fights, it has satisfying plots, it has character development. It has light, happy moments, deep feelsy moments, pure badass moments. It even has horrifying/terrifying moments, and
                  extremely creepy moments thanks to one character named Hisoka. It will make you ride a rollercoaster of emotions. 
I think the most important part is that it takes everything that other anime do, and it does it better, and it makes you feel it more. Also, this anime will make you question right and wrong so hard, and when you hit the Chimera Ant Arc (not sure if it's officially called that), it will make you ask deep philosophical questions about the human race.
I love many of the characters so much that I can't even say which one I love most. I absolutely adore Knuckle and Ging. This anime has enemies that I enjoy hating. There are even enemies that I start out hating, but end up liking and pitying. 
Now that I'm done gushing, here is a more technical review:
Fighting - The fight scenes are fantastic and well animated in my opinion. The power/ability system is great. It all comes from one source that is easy to understand, but at the same time, each person has a unique and interesting ability that suits their personality and style of fighting. Each character's abilities were carefully thought out.
Character Development - The character development is noticeable throughout the anime, although I should note that the development for Leorio and Kurapika is less than I feel it should've been. 
- Leorio is pretty much the same from start to finish. In the first few episodes, he is seen as greedy, but gradually you learn he has an ulterior motive. After that, he doesn't change much, but he's already a cool guy, so I still like him. 
- Kurapika has the same goal throughout the anime, and is extremely obsessed with it. In the beginning, he seems rather transparent and is mainly defined by his desire for revenge and his ability to strategize and out-think opponents. In the middle, his development progresses some, because he takes his obsession for revenge to a whole new level, and is key in defeating an extremely powerful antagonist group. However, after the middle arc, he disappears and isn't seen again until the end. I am both disappointed and extremely intrigued by this. I think there is a spinoff of this anime concerning Kurapika, so that may explain why so little is seen of him after the first two-thirds of the anime. 
I also want to note that while we barely get to meet Gon's father, he is such a colorful and likable character that you feel like you already know him, especially since Gon is already a lot like his father, but also his own person. The way they managed to make him resemble his father while being true to his unique identity is simply amazing. 
Plot - The plot is excellent, and allows for both character development and colorful development of the world the characters live in. There were many times when I was expecting the plot to do one thing, but was pleasantly surprised and left hanging in suspense when it went in the complete opposite direction. The plot for this anime is thorough and progressive, and it will keep you on your toes. So much happened in this anime that I didn't feel disappointed when it ended. I felt satisfied and pleased. Sometimes certain aspects of the plot are left unanswered, but I feel like this was done on purpose, for a more realistic feel. For example, one main character finds out about their mentor's secret ability, while the other never learns of it. 
Feels/Drama - This anime is packed with drama and feels. It starts out fairly light-hearted, and gets progressively more deep and full of feels. This anime will make you angry, frustrated, and tearful all at the same time. You will probably be crying once you get through the Chimera Ant Arc. 
Animation/Illustration - I also love that, in this anime, characters look diverse. I attempted to watch Fairy Tale, but I got bored because all the characters literally looked the same, except with different hair/eyes/clothes. However, in Hunter x Hunter, characters all look unique, ranging from the typical anime face to a craggy, detailed semi-realistic face. I was never bored with a character's appearance. 
Wow, this is a long review. But yeah, long story short, this anime is amazing. Anyone who watches anime needs to watch this one.",10

                Hunter X Hunter is an absolute masterpiece created by the legendary Togashi
It'a a series that has almost everything
wild adventure: check
complex characters: check
memorable fight scenes : check
intense emotions: check 
a perfect power-system: check
and almost everything else is a check
what starts out as a simple story about a boy wanting to find his father and become a Hunter aka a person who has access to everything turns out be a rollercoaster of a adventurous series, Hunter x Hunter is perhaps the best example in anime of never judge a book by it's cover, it has very rich characters who seem insanely compelling and interesting that you would
                  be thining of them all day and still not be able to comprehend how well written they truly is.
HxH has one of the best arcs in anime in my books the Chimera ant arc which is a very all-rounding arc
HxH fleshes out a character's development slowly but surely where the character does not show off his development that much making it very relatable in a sense
these series does things which makes it stands out among other shonen anime
HxH sets up it's arcs in such a way that allows him to make different scenarios instead of getting the best pay-off from intense that other Shonen anime do
Togashi's characters are rich with personality,
with very complex characters like Hisoka, Killua , Kurapika, Gon, Meruem Chrollo and Illumi who are not very black nor very white even when it comes to the protagonists Gon and Killua , 
 HxH also has an extremely realistic and jaw-dropping story-line which gives us exposure of the characters, even tho there is a lack of conflict i the series it still manages to  portray tense  scenarios in a very unpredictable way.
the art and the character are extremely well designed in HxH from the Phantom Troupe members to the Chimera ants 
 the fight scenes are pretty brilliant and tactical thanks to Nen Aura for being the model Power system, Nen's insane versatility allows the characters go play Death Note level mind games with each other all while finding an opening to attack, Nen gives someone a different way to use their aura based on their affinity, with fights like Meruem vs Netero, Gon vs Hisoka, Gon vs Neferpitou etc
HxH is honestly a model Shonen anime.",10

                Out of any anime, Hunter x Hunter was the only one that managed not only to match my expectations, but completely blow it out of the water, even though this show was already super hyped to me. I was expecting nothing short of a masterpiece and I got that, and more. This is the rare anime that goes above and beyond and manages to be even better than the manga itself. 
Everything is done right in this anime. Literally everything. The story, the characters, the pacing, the action sequences, the tension, the art, the sound, it's all amazing. I truly wonder why this anime isn't
                  as mainstream as other Shonen series like One Piece, Naruto, or Fairy Tail because it's at least 10 trillion times better than any of those anime series. 
The story- interesting and gripping from the beginning to the end. The art- beautiful, the animators clearly put in 100% in it and not a single shot feels lazy. Sound- sound effects are satisfying and the soundtrack is beautiful. The characters- The protagonists are lovable, interesting, and full of depth. The antagonists are equally interesting, intimidating, and sometimes even sympathetic. I simply cannot praise this show enough. You've probably heard this many times, not just for this show but for others, but keep watching even if you find the early parts boring! You will not regret it, especially when it starts to pick up, and it picks up fast. 
I've told friends to watch it, and all of them have messaged me back a few weeks later, thanking me for introducing them to such an amazing anime. Do yourself a favor, and watch this if you haven't. Don't even bother reading the synopsis. This is a show that is best watched not knowing what's going to happen next. I envy people who are just starting to watch this show, if only I could experience HxH again without knowing anything about it. Easy 10/10.",10

                Story: 10/10
Ive never expirienced a story like HxH. It felt so alive, lovely amd unbelievably creativ. I remember back then when i strated HxH i went in with my Mind being complwtly open and having no expectations. Also the cover looked like its gonna be this kids show but oh boy i was so wrong i got so much more. it was unbelievable that such a story like HxH exists. After 3 episodes i was hooked and so immersed. I couldnt  take my eyes from the screen. i couldnt stop watching. I fell in love at that point. The way togashi displays his story
                  is so unique. Each arc is vastly different from eachother. 1st we have a exam arc than rescue arc, than tournament arc, than L.A. Noire auction arc and so on.
Just to name some. There is no other show that does this. Also HxH has hands down the best combat system.
Character: 10/10
This is the driving force behind HxH. Every Character gets well characterised. All of our 4 main cast has  Motivation as to why they do what they do. Which makes them likeable and relatable. There are lots of amazing characters in here. Also the dynamic between our main 4 is great.
Art: 9/10
Some episodes had stellar animation. Very fluid and smooth. in each arc the overall tone changes from dark to lighthearted. Also HxH has lots of colorful visuals. They fights are very well animated. so pleasing to the eye.
Sound: 9/10
The opening that played through the whole show got burned in to my soul. Also the ost is very good. There are lots of amazing pieces. The voice acting is superb.
Enjoyment: 10/10
I enjoyed every arc of HxH. It had alot to offer.After watching HxH i got a better understanding of what a good anime or show in general. HxH made me think in ways i never thought i would. it had a lasting impression on me.
I loved every little piece of HXH from the bottom of  my heart. 
Thank you.
Overall:9.6=10/10",10

                This show is just about as great as everyone says it is. 
It has a similar beginning premise as Naruto where we have a dim-witted kid with a dream off to earn some sort of title and partakes in a combat-intensive exam in the process. 
The story then evolves following Gon and Killua into an epic, yet very shounen, quest to gain strength in order for Gon to reach his goal of finding his father. The Journey however is quite clearly is the focus of the show as the plot itself isn't very ""deep"".
It has easily one of the most cheer-able casts of characters in
                  all of anime history, I only wish that they elaborated on them more towards the end or at least gave them more organic ending sequences. Additionally the pace of the story really drags its feet during a certain arc, I wont name any names but I'll just say that it gets bogged down by excessive and unnecessary narration throughout.
Overall, this show is a definite crowd-pleaser  balanced by the heartwarming simplicity of its characters. I give it the green light!",8
"
                Having just finished watching this I'm sad beyond tears that in MAL you can't rate a show higher than 10 because if you could, Hunter x Hunter would be one of those few rare anime that'd deserve it. Either way, I'll recommend it the following 2 types of people: 
1) Those who didn't know a single thing about the H x H universe: I won't even tell you what the story is about but instead ask you:
Do you want to see how far the limits of an anime story can be pushed? Do you want to see something that will make you fullfiled as human
                  or maybe question yourself? Do you want to see something meaningful and emotional? Do you want to find out what a god-like mangaka can create? Do you want to watch an anime which is and isn't a shounen at the same time? Do you want to see a journey that doesn't have a straight-forward path? Do you want a TV show made for anything but ""kill time""?
If you replied yes to any of these questions your answer is to watch Hunter x Hunter. Whether you accept it or not, it will always be there waiting for you, when you finally decided to enter the universe. HxH is unexpectedly made for most people because it kinda is about people, 3-dimensional people with hopes, dreams, fears, regrets, desires and their ability to change, along with their weaknesses and strengths, their mistakes and their learning. Don't miss out on the show that leaves its viewers in such indescribable, confusing emotional state. 
2) Those watched 1999 Version of HxH: I used to be one of these people. I hated the idea of new voice actors and a kinda different impression about the main characters. I did wonder if it could actually get better than Yorkshin City arc. And the Opening, I used to think it was so annoying. Many years later, I finally decided to give 2011 a try and the only thing that I regret after having finally seen episode 148 is ""why didn't I watch it sooner????"".
My qualms about 2011 were easily dissuaded as you grow incredibly fond and in awe of the voice actor's skills, particularly Gon's and Killua's. The characters are designed slightly different than in 1999's version, albeit true to the manga, but that really doesn't affect the depth and richness of the story. Another nice touch is that the story goes much faster because it doesn't ever engage with filler episodes. Oh, and the Opening: there is no other more fitting theme song for such a story; it's impossible not to be moved by it even if at start you don't like it. You just try again. 
I plead that you don't content yourself with where 1999's ends, because that is only the 1% of what Hunter x Hunter is about. Do yourself a favor and live this experience that will make you understand why is currently top 4 in MAL with a 9+ score. Let's avoid spoilers and you be the judge of the anime that leaves people not speechless but quite the opposite because there is a lot to say about it, too much, about this masterpiece.",10
"
                TLDR: The fights are too one sided and lack suspense, Greed Island had lackluster villains, lacked actual ""gameplay"" despite build up, Nen just does whatever the author wants and sometimes breaks established rules (Alluka), there are no negative consequences for the main cast, lots of wasted potential for characters and plot points, Palm is weird, Killua's character development goes to the dumpster, I dislike Gon and Ging's relationship and feel like Ging is glorified too much, chimera ants look weird, pacing is off.
Fights
Ngl I love a good beatdown in a show, but hxh just has entirely too many completely one sided fights. It makes things
                  too predictable, cutting out the suspense. The only relatively even fights are the Phantom Troupe vs the Chimera ants, but again a lot of them end in a complete stomp once the troupe member reveals their power. Don't get me wrong I love most of hxh's fights, some of my favorites like Gon vs Pitou or Meruem vs Netero are completely one sided. But like I said it gets old and lackluster after a while. Some fights even pretend to be balanced like Morel vs Cheetu and then flip the script and reveal that it wasn't at all. Or a fight like Chrollo vs Hisoka which is legitimately balanced but of course the author found a way to make it a stomp.
Greed Island Arc in general
This was honestly one of the worst arcs I've ever read in my entire life. Like did some fucked up shit happen in the author's life to make the quality dip so badly out of nowhere? I'll explain why I dislike it so badly.
First of all the villains in this arc were terrible. Genthuru and pals were extremely shallow, poorly developed, cliche psychopathic murderers looking for a quick buck. Genthuru himself is generically evil with no real reason for it besides ""money XDDD"". Not that motivation itself always need to be some deep complex stuff but if it's not then there has to be some redeeming factor to the character. None of which can be found here. Genthuru's pals have zero unique or even slightly distinctive personality and Genthuru is again just some saturday morning cartoon villain on steroids with the murder aspect. But holy shit he also likes his friends I guess? Damn guess he doesn't deserve to die for what he did because ""they're the same"". Killua really came out of nowhere with this shit argument that he killed people so he can't be the one to judge. And then this donkey kong motherfucker says ""it's because I like you"". Shut up. Such shit and shallow arguments from both sides. Well Killua, do I really need to explain that you are a 13 year old kid conditioned by your family and quite literally mentally manipulated by your older brother to murder people in cold blood, and the first person you meet outside your killer life instantly becomes your friend while you make a conscious decision to go against your very instincts and abandon the killer life? Who holds you responsible for these actions? Meanwhile this grown, fully developed 30 year old man is murdering innocents in cold blood because he wants to and enjoys it. Total failure on the author's part to present an interesting moral argument. Way too in your face preachy and surface level.
The second new villain was the scissors serial killer. I actually had to take a minute to check if I was watching hunter x hunter and not Naruto because that's the only other show I've seen turn a brutal murderer good in a couple minutes. This shark looking guy is some violent psychopath who has spent his life torturing and killing innocent people with some safety scissors and eating hair(???) and then he gets beat by Bisky and showed up by some kids and then suddenly has this epiphany like ""wow I used to be a kid too"" and decides to turn himself in... Completely unrealistic transition with zero buildup to it.
And the third new villain Razor had a really great fight that gave a lot of characterization to Gon and Killua and foreshadowed Gon's fight with Pitou, but I found myself rolling my eyes at the cliche big black guy with gay rape vibes who is just there to make others look cool and I don't really like the ending where Razor just stared into Gon's eyes thinking about Ging but then they barely even talked.
Second, the arc begins with a lot of development for the actual game and how it works, but then never actually does anything with it. We don't get to see much actual ""gameplay"" to the point where the actual game aspect barely even matters in the first place. And yeah, they use the cards a lot but they only use like 3 or 4 out of around 90 or so. I started to get tired of hearing ""accompany on"" over and over again.
I was gonna say a third point but I completely forgot what I was going to write. It might seem like a little with only 2 points but honestly the 1st point alone seriously hindered my viewing experience.
Nen
Nen as a power system is pretty good, but some of the abilities that people have just don't make any sense within the limitations of nen. For example Kurapika, in order to conjure up chains, had to spend every waking moment thinking about them, feeling them, even tasting them. Killua was only able to use his powers because he was tortured with electricity as a child. But then we get to Knov who can.... create portals.... How exactly is this possible? How the hell do you taste a portal?
Another example of weirdly explained abilties is Phinks'. What exactly are the limitations on his power? Can he wind up forever and keeping gaining power or is he limited to however much nen he has? And the restrictions for these overpowered abilities get less and less strict as time goes on. Chrollo has become one of the most versatile and insanely powerful people in the story to be able to turn a relatively balanced match into a complete stomp, while not having the insanely strict restrictions to make up for that aspect. Even the simple but very confining restriction he had before of needing to hold his book in his hand is now gone, albeit the restriction for the bookmark technique is never given to my knowledge but I have no doubts that it will not be very deterring to Chrollo’s combat efficiency.
It seems like at one point the author watched jojo and was like wow that's pretty cool let me do that except much less visually appealing. Doctor Blythe, APR, Nen beasts, Cookie chan, etc. they're all just stands lmao. I even heard that King Crimson is literally in the manga later on. None of this is a diss though, I mean what shounen manga wasn't inspired by Jojo? I will also say this, I think that La Squadra is a much better Phantom Troupe, don't @ me.
Lack of negative consequences for the main cast
There are zero lasting consequences for the main cast in this show. Everything always conveniently works out in the end. Killua can't face some rabbit because he's been conditioned to not fight people he is scared of? It's fine he just has to remove some needle in his brain and one shot them. Gon loses his arm in the Genthuru fight and very explicitly states that he is ""straying from the plan"" implying the result will be permanent? Too bad, it's actually not cause the plan was to heal everyone at the end anyway. Both Kite and (manga spoiler)           Hisoka biologically die (decapitation and lack of oxygen to the brain for a prolonged time)?!?? ok well it's fucking nen of course they can come back to life. Bungee gum has the properties of both rubber and gum bitch, of course it can be used on the heart and lungs to resuscitate someone who's BRAIN IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONING. At the very least he should have some brain damage What makes these moments bad storytelling is that the author establishes a set back for a particular character and then is presumably too scared to go through with it since he got caught up in the hype of the moment, so he retracts it. Some instances I'm not even sure why. Like what was Togashi thinking when he brought back Kite? Not only does it devalue Gon's sacrifice, it just has zero purpose. Kite hasn't done anything yet, and from the looks of it he never will. Or she I should say I suppose. Which brings me to my next point.
Wasted potential
So much wasted potential in this show. Going back to the last section, Kite's transition into a young girl's body from an adult male. It would be so interesting to get some insight into his thought's and feelings not only on his younger body, but his gender change as well. Togashi seems to love his LGBTQ representation, especially the 'T', so I was surprised he didn't go more into this. That along with Leorio, pretty much all of the Chimera ants, and NGL and East Gorteau all seemed to go to waste in my eyes. Of course it would heavily extend the story to resolve and develop all these things but then I have to ask why even set it all up in the first place? I remember Killua had a scene just explaining the politics of East Gorteau, and while interesting, it just doesn't matter at all plot wise. At this point I doubt even Gyro will show up again.
Characters
I have an issue with loads of characters in this series. I'll just make a bullet list of a few.
Palm Siberia - This character is just really weird. At first she is obviously portrayed as a horrible person who is very clearly mentally ill and desperately needs help. But then her obsessiveness with Gon and creepiness in general starts to become displayed more like some funny quirk of hers then a legitimate concern. This is so awkward for me to say but she even seems like a pedophile? And it's portrayed in a positive manner like it's therapy for her. It's just so creepy and uncomfortable to watch these scenes play out the way they did. Everything about her is inconsistent from her personality which switched back and forth from insane stalker to some lady and the tramp bullshit with Gon, to back to insane after she became a Chimera ant.
Also I'm not really sure what they were thinking with Palm's ""plan"". It took me out of it when it was being revealed because there was a nonexistent chance for it to ever work out in any way. First of all Palm had to be chosen specifically by this creeper motherfucker out of tons of women. I guess she just assumed she was all that. Then she had to pipe that dude with a dildo and drug him afterwards, sneak over to the palace, pass by Pitou's nen (they had no idea it was gone at that time) and somehow see the extremely powerful king who murdered Kite and drove Knov to madness without being spotted or somehow being quick enough to escape. Yeah, no. That isn't happening in any timeline. I get that they were desperate but that plan was made to fail. Seems like Palm just wanted some sexy time with that creepy guy.
Killua - Killua started off really good as a character I loved his development and relationship with Gon, which culminated in the Chimera ant arc where he learned to not idolize him, and truly become his own independent person even making a new friend that wasn't just ""Gon's friend that I know"". But then it all goes down the drain when Alluka is introduced. Alluka in general I have a load of problems with because of how she flipped the power scaling upside down with her extremely overpowered ability to grant any wish and even bend reality to grant it, but her relationship with Killua is really bad. So she has established rules and restrictions to her powers, with many people dying depending on the wish she grants, but then apparently Killua is exempt. Which can only mean that Alluka/Something freely chooses to murder people in exchange for granting wishes, and only has Killua as the exception because he makes her feel good. Why is this a problem? Because Killua just spent an entire arc realizing that his glorified love interest Gon is not as morally perfect as he made him out to be. Then he goes on to glorify his demon spawn of a sister? Alluka gets mad because Killua does the right thing and tells Something to go back to hell and then he is just like ""whatever then, the safety of others be damned"", and calls her perfect the way she is. You gotta be kidding me. So you go from Gon the kid threatener to Alluka the mass murderer. Great. He hasn't learned a thing.
Gon and Ging - I want to include them both here since a lot of my issues with Gon stem from his relationship with his father. But first of all I'll tackle Gon by himself. The entire show with moments like the auction guy thinking about Gon's dangerous world view of not caring about good or evil, to the dodgeball match with razor where Killua's hands were messed up by him, or his fight with Genthuru where he gave his arm in exchange for beating an opponent his own way, all these moments lead up to a climax where Gon would do irreversible damage to someone or something. And this moment did come... for a short time. Gon powered up against Pitou by sacrificing his own life or potential or something (it's never explained just what he gave up) and brutally beat her to death in that state. But then afterwards he just walks it off, again. The author just can't seem to make a consequence stick. When you build up to a moment where Gon is supposed to seriously mess himself up, but then he gets right back up without consequence besides supposedly not being able to use nen (of course it is most likely temporary, he just has to re-learn), then all the previous build up falls apart, since the climax never came. The only real effect was that Killua and Gon are separated, but again that is only temporary and there are of course issues with Killua in that too which I explained earlier. Gon doesn't change from that event, he would definitely do it again in a heart beat. He's the same old Gon, because there was no real consequence of that action.
Gon and Ging's relationship always felt so incredibly forced to me. I never liked the moments where Gon would look up into the sky, beaming, and talking about how he would one day meet his dad with Killua in the corner fucking blushing and getting turned on by that shit like it's the greatest thing he's ever heard. The series always glorifies Ging as some sort of ultimate treasure and an amazing hunter. You might say ""oh many people hate him and point out that he sucks as a dad"". Ok true but the series portrays those moments as comedic and not at all serious, and Ging is always in control regardless of what they say. Leorio calls him trash and attacks him, well he actually let himself get hit. People are trash talking him and he just beats them up in a comedic moment. Nobody of actual relevance dislikes him unless they're a villain. They either respect him at least a little or outright nut over him like Kite. Like dude, the kid you beat up one time sees you as more of a dad than he does Ging, his real father. Maybe he's not so great a guy huh. Ging can really do no wrong in the story. His abandonment of Gon and his own family is painted as a call to adventure that should have been taken, he is widely respected by many great hunters and even considered one of the top hunters in the entire world, he can copy someone else's technique just by getting hit by it, that's not even his main ability just something he can do cause he's so amazing, he's a strategic mastermind and genius, able to predict other people's moves in advance with insane accuracy and make plans years before they come to fruition, he has incredible amounts of wealth, able to change someone's life in an instant without worrying about it, and on and on. Damn I get it, Ging is god. Maybe I'm just irritated by this because of my own relationship to my father irl, I don't really see anyone else who has had this view.
Also Gon and Ging's actual first meeting felt very unsatisfying. It didn't feel earned. All the time Gon spent looking for Ging just for him to find him in a random place he just happened to be at at the time.
Pacing
Ah finally. We get to the one actual criticism that hxh fans actually discuss. This is mainly with the chimera ant arc. You've all heard this before. The narrarator adds to some moments and really ruins others by talking so much. It just feels unfocused. We have time for like 10 episodes with Ikalgo fighting a no name chimera ant which honestly just felt like filler (though it was slightly enjoyable I guess), but can't go back to Gon and Meruem who are both much more interesting.",4

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERS
I finished watching Hunter x Hunter (2011) a few weeks ago and it is a very good anime with an amazing plot and the main character isn't too overpowered which you commonly find in shounen animes. 
The best arc was the Chimera Ant arc it was so detailed and we got to see more of Killua and Gon fighting alongside each other. The only bad part is that Leorio and Kurapika were nowhere to be found in this arc. I understand that Kurapika is busy look for the scarlet eyes and Leorio's still in med school but I wish they could
                  have showed up once. Not to fight but just be there to see Gon and Killua after the Greed Island arc ended.
My favourite character is Illumi. Many people hate him because of the way he treats his brother. He treats his horribly and manipulates him but I always liked his style and how he kills people. It always intrigued me as he killed with pins and his outfits are so cool. 
The only thing I hate is that people will on purpose mis gender Kurapika and Illumi because they apparently look ""female"". I for one don't see this at all.
Overall the whole anime is good the openings are catchy and they have very lovable characters.",10

                So back in September of last year, I decided to start HxH (2011) on a whim. I came into the anime not expecting much at all—curiously skeptical to be specific. And honestly, the first few episodes were a bore, but I trudged on at the request of a friend. After a few more episodes though, I was convinced that I had stumbled upon a gem.   
And now, in May of 2016, I realize that it’s my “duty” as a fan of this series to spread the word about it. The least I could do is submit a review detailing Hunter x Hunter’s awesomeness, right? With
                  that said, this is my first review on this site so keep in mind this is completely my opinion! If you feel the need to comment on something, feel free to shoot a message my way.
Alright, shall we begin our departure? : >
Story: 9
A common misconception surrounding Hunter x Hunter, be it the 1999 or the 2011 version, is that it's a juvenile anime. Don’t let the seemingly childish facet deter you from trying it out! Trust me, once you get to a certain arc in this anime, those doubts will be vanquished immediately. Overall, the plot line is captivating (after you get past the first few episodes) and unlike some anime shows where the thrill factor only exists in the first watching, Hunter x Hunter never ceases to entertain.
Art: 7
I will not deny that HxH’s art style has grown leaps and bounds from the first episode to the very last, but I will also not deny that when you compare HxH’s animation to that of, let’s say, Fate/stay night: UBW’s, it simply wilts in comparison. The art is good—it gets the meaning across effectively but that’s the highest praise I will give it.  
Sound: 9
The music in HxH is nothing short of incredible. The opening stays the same throughout the anime, however if you’re like me and my friends, I can guarantee that you’ll be belting out the opening throughout the later arcs. The endings of HxH are even more impressive. The band ゆず has not failed to make an ending piece that does not perfectly convey an arc’s theme yet. 
Character: 8
All of the characters in Hunter x Hunter—and I mean every single one—are memorable in their own way. Even the problematic ones. Well, they’re actually easier to remember. Point is, you certainly won’t be forgetting any one of them soon (unless you binge watched over twenty episodes at a time or something…but who’d do that?). Furthermore, every single character in the main cast (Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio) has undergone some sort of character development—and some of it’s not pretty. However, it’s realistic and that’s something you don’t often see in a shounen anime. 
Enjoyment + Overall: 9
In conclusion, Hunter x Hunter is an anime not to be overlooked at all. I made the mistake of avoiding it for a couple of years before finally settling down to watch it. If you’re anything like majority of the people on this site, you’ll like it. I mean, it’s not like it’s #5 of all the anime in the history of ever for being “meh, I guess it alright.” The show will be unforgiveable to say the least—there’ll be an abundance of laughing, crying, shouting, groaning, and smiling. Trust me on this one, it’s an anime you wouldn’t want to miss. Hopefully I gave you enough ""reason"" to watch…
Thanks x for x Reading!",9

                I don't normally like long-running shounens, but when I do,
IT'S HUNTER X HUNTER
To be honest I don't really think I'm one to judge these kinds of shows, long running shounens...because I haven't seen many myself, out of the long and popular ones like One Piece, Naruto, DBZ, Fairy Tail and the like, the only ones I have seen out of that bunch is DBZ and just a pinch of Naruto.
But I honestly don't see why this isn't up with those shows, HxH is a classic.
It takes a simple concept, a boy wanting to find his father, and makes it a brilliant show.
Since watching pretty much
                  most of the DBZ universe, (Except for DB and DBS) I've watched Dragon Ball Kai, and DBZ and almost all the movies, um, I pretty much used to the formula of ""Someone wants to take over the world, let's train and stop them""
And while I did enjoy DBZ, it's fights I have to say....well, they are dragged out and don't have too much....creativity to them, I haven't watched DBZ in a while, so they are probably a few exceptions but that is just what I'm used to.
But I'm really happy HxH kept it fresh with very well-thought out battles and excellent moments where you get to see just how powerful some people are. Overall it is just really fun to see the characters interact with the side characters and watch them grow.
So overall, if you have some time, and in the mood for an entertaining shounen, I highly recommend this series, it has excellent animation and music btw XD
The only reason I haven't given it a perfect 10 masterpiece rating, is probably because this show suffers from what alot of shows normally suffer from, a disappointing arc, and the occasional plot holes. Now for me and the scale on how I rate things, 9 is a pretty impressive score, 10 has to literally be a perfect show, and while this shows does have those occasional flaws, it's definitely a gem you should not miss out on.
Thanks for reading!",9
"
                This is going to be my first review! I will try to speak in general terms but there are spoilers ranging from small to large. For this review, I'll be discussing my thoughts and ideas for some general criteria and then for each arc. 
Story (8/10)
Most of the time when the show introduces a story element (or even a character), it's boring. The arcs dedicated to introducing story elements, Heavens Arena, and the first half of the Chimera Ant arc suffer from this especially. Most of the time, these concepts are introduced to the audience all at once which leaves them confused. Other times, the
                  show introduces these concepts with exposition dumps which are, again, boring. 
However, what the show does well is the “journey” part of the story. Once concepts are introduced, the show does very well at using the plot elements to weave an interesting story. Thank god the show dedicates most of its run time to this side of the story. I’ve noticed that in a lot of the arcs, the show sets up “rules” or a tiered system of progression that seem very straightforward. The show is linear, but it excels at manipulating its linear paths to create an interesting story.
Art (Art 6/10, Character Design 7/10, Cinematography 5/10) 6/10
The art in the show is pretty standard. There's nothing offensively bad or overwhelmingly beautiful. With this said, during the end of the Chimera Ant arc, the show really seemed to give their animators more creative freedom. This resulted in the art playing a role in telling the story, whereas, in the rest of the show, the art merely was there to look good.
The Character Design in Hunter X Hunter is fairly good. With the sheer amount of characters in the show, it can be hard making each one distinguishable. Fortunately, the show does this well. There is a fair share of bad character designs in my opinion, but all of the main characters have good to great designs. 
The cinematography in the show is fine. It’s pretty standard as far as anime goes, but there really isn’t any usage of the cinematography to tell a part of the story on its own. It gets the fundamentals right, but that's all it really needs to do in a show that is mainly plot-driven. 
Sound (Music) 5/10
The music of HXH is, on its own, quite good. My biggest issue is when you have a soundtrack that is the size of a standard anime's soundtrack for a show that is the equivalent of nearly 11 standard shows. I often found myself briefly taken out of the story because the music that was playing was so overused. In certain instances, the music choice was downright inappropriate. I feel like this is the result of the soundtrack being so limited. Most of the songs are either very dramatic classical pieces, eerie villain themes, or spunky adventure music, which cannot be used in all scenarios. I would have liked to see a larger variety of songs that would be applicable to a wider array of situations. With that being said, at points, the music really does add a lot to the unfolding events of the show, and at worst briefly takes me out of the plot. 5/10
Characters 6/10
The characters in HxH are fine. Generally, the main characters are inoffensive and archetypal, which makes them rather predictable. My favorite characters, Knuckle, Meruem, and Kurapika, are fantastic characters because they undergo some kind of fundamental change. Their experiences in the show directly influence the characters they become by the series’s end. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about most of the main characters. Gon, in particular, experiences temporary changes in emotion, producing superficial emotions such as anger, sadness, grief, and excitement, but he never really grows from his experiences. Aside from the Nen and combat abilities he gains, he doesn’t really grow as a person. By the end of the show, he is the same selfless, and sometimes foolish kid as he was in episode 1. Again, characters like Knuckle and Meruem really save the show at points which is why I give this section a 6/10.
Hunter Exam Arc- 5/10
It's sort of strange writing this review nearly a year after I finished this arc. I’m sure I don’t remember everything about the arc, and I may even misremember some parts in my review, but I can pretty confidently say that it was alright. 
The first few episodes introduce the main characters of the arc, and in typical HXH fashion, does so rather poorly. Leorio is introduced as a hot-headed guy during a very briefly heated fight which seemed rather forced. Kurapika is a bland character at this point, seeming like the level-headed boy scout type, and doesn’t really generate any reactions to anything beyond the words he says. Gon is introduced as a selfless, but foolish kid when he jumps off of a boat to save someone who fell overboard. He loses his footing, which is when Leorio and Kurapika grab his legs to save him. This results in the trio becoming best friends. The whole scene seemed a bit fake as a whole but it wasn’t egregious. 
The rest of the arc is fine, with it at points feeling rather monotonous and linear. It eventually succeeds at establishing the main protagonists and villains and gives them compelling motives for the rest of the series. Overall it is between fine and good, and is a 5/10
Zoldyck Family Arc- 2.5/10
Unfortunately, this is the worst arc. Fortunately, this is the shortest arc. This arc primarily focused on introducing the Zoldyck family. Again, the show does not introduce things well. It's boring, and the Zoldyck family characters are, at this point, boiled-down, archetypal versions of what they will become. There is apparently some internal family conflict between Kilua and the rest of his family, as they literally kidnap him and put him into restraints, but the reason for this wasn't really obvious to me. It just seems more like a poor excuse to introduce the Zoldycks. 3/10
Heavens Arena Arc- 3/10
One of the most boring arcs in the show. Its plot is highly linear and the show doesn’t do much to twist its linear path. The main characters Gon and Kilua embark to climb the ranks of Heavens Arena to win money. It's about as boring as it sounds, especially when compared to other arcs. Each battle seems meaningless as they could only result in a temporary demotion to a lower floor. I understand that the monetary reward is very important to Gon and Kilua to purchase a copy of Greed Island, but the show never really makes it seem too important.
The Nen training scenes in this arc try to explain the aspects of Nen, Ren… I honestly lost track of all the terms. There are too many terms thrown at the audience at once, and even if I pause the show to digest each individual aspect of Nen, it really doesn’t matter. Sure the show frequently mentions the terms in the succeeding arcs. However, visual cues such as aura surrounding different parts of the main character's bodies are more than enough to convey the purpose of each move. There are boring, drawn-out scenes where the main characters do nothing but repetitive training for minutes at a time.
It's a very boring arc with some offensively bad parts, but some redeemable scenes. 3/10 overall. 
Yorknew City Arc- 8/10
Yay! Finally a good arc. What I really appreciated about this arc is that it didn’t spend too much time introducing anything new. Nearly all of the characters at this point are already established, and even the Phantom Troupe has already been mentioned several times. The action in this arc is really great, and it does a good job at manipulating the “rules'' of Nen that were established in the Heavens Arena Arc.
Characters like Kurapika and Lucifer really shine through in this arc. Lucifer was an especially compelling character for me, despite his sparing presence. 
I don’t really have much to say about this arc other than it is an 8.5/10
Greed Island Arc- 5/10
I don’t necessarily dislike this arc, it's just kinda pointless. From what I gathered (it's not really explicitly stated from what I remember) the game Greed Island is designed to train Gon into becoming a powerful Nen user. However, the game itself never really does much to teach Gon. Instead, Biscuit coincidentally happens to be in the game who offers to train Gon and Kilua. These scenes are by far the most boring in the entire arc, with long, drawn-out scenes of repetitive training. 
The rest of the arc is fine, with most of it seeming like a rebranded Hunter Exam Arc with its tones, themes, and conflict. There aren’t necessarily stages per se but the plot is highly linear. The main villain in the arc, Genthru, really doesn’t seem all too powerful and it's kind of baffling as to how he wasn’t defeated earlier. He lacks any real personality, really no compelling motives, and he really isn’t too compelling. 
At points, this arc was dull and boring but is mostly mediocre. 5.5/10
Chimera Ant Arc
For the sake of this review, I will be splitting this arc into two halves. It is a massive arc with 61 episodes, and has one discernable tone change around episode 93 when the Queen Ant dies. 
Chimera Ant Arc pt. 1- 6/10
There are just so many new characters in this arc. Unfortunately, they need to be introduced. Aside from Kite, and most of the important Chimera Ants, most of the character intros seem borderline offensive to the character they are introducing. Knuckle in particular is introduced as an opponent to Gon and Kilua, and appears to be hot-headed and blunt. However, his status as an opponent is soon lifted as the audience learns of his true compassionate nature. I do not know why they decided to introduce him as a villain at first as it really doesn’t serve any purpose.
I don’t get this show’s affinity for including romance between underage characters and older ones. For whatever reason, they dedicate nearly an entire episode just so Gon (12) and Palm (22) can go on a date. It's just as pointless as it is gross as it serves no purpose later on in the series. 
The action is fine. There are minor action sequences between low-tier ants and the main characters, but the battles don’t really seem all too special. 
Overall, this half of the arc is fine in lots of ways and boring in others. 6/10
Chimera Ant Arc pt. 2- 9/10
The action in this section really shines through, with nearly every battle sequence carrying some weight, purpose, and meaning. The action is animated really well, and artistic moments are allowed to shine through especially in the battle between Youpie and Knuckle, which ended up being my favorite battle sequence of the entire show. The battle between Meruem and Niero was also phenomenal and it deserves all the praise it receives. 
All of the characters that were previously established have important roles which I really appreciate. Additionally, this is the first time where we see our main characters, Gon and Killua, finally endure some kind of maturing change. Gon develops a more serious disposition, which physically manifests itself in some phenomenal tension building and action. Kilua also becomes more compassionate and selfless as he starts to act as Gon's protector. Their dynamic has always worked well throughout the show, and it really starts to shine in their moments together in this arc. 
Of course, I can’t leave out my two favorite characters in the show, Knuckle, and Meruem. Knuckle has grown a lot since when he was first introduced, and this culminates in his battle sequence with Youpi. The hand-to-hand combat sequences are really great, but their battle is also a psychological one, which makes it even greater in my opinion. The moments before their battle ends, when Knuckle realizes he is about to die, are probably some of the best moments in the show. It's beautifully animated and captivating, giving a terrifying look into the mind of someone who is about to die. It’s fantastic. 
Meruem is another character who endures tremendous growth. After being established as the merciless evil villain in the first part of the arc, he begins to display glimmers of humanity after playing Gungi with Komugi. (Quick interjection, but even the most mundane scenes between Meruem and Komugi while they are talking over a game of Gungi are fantastic and really help to develop Meruem's struggle between his humanity and his mercilessness.) These glimmers eventually manifest into affection for Komugi which gives him compassion and humanity and ultimately turns him from villain to just another character. By the end of the arc, there are no villains, which is a risky move that the show pulled off flawlessly. 
I’ve noticed some people complaining about how his death was “anticlimactic” since he died from the poisonous gas released by a bomb, but I can’t help but disagree. His knowledge of his impending doom forces him to live out his last moments doing what he truly loves- playing Gungi with Komugi. In Romeo and Juliet fashion, Komugi commits suicide to be with Meruem in his final moments. The second to last episode of this arc nearly had me in tears with its closing dialogue, 
“Komugi, I wanted...to spend my final moments playing against you. But this poison is contagious. If you stay near me too long, you will also...
Meruem-sama… Right now, I am very happy. I may not be worthy, but please allow me to join you.
I see… I… I believe that I was born to be here today. ...was born for this moment.
Komugi, are you still there? Yes, I sure am. I'm not going anywhere.
Komugi, are you still here? 
Yes, yes... Right here.
Komugi, are you still here? 
Yes, of course.
I need to take a short nap. Will you hold my hand? Komugi? Komugi, are you there?
I can hear you. I understand. Like this?
I'll wake up shortly. Will you stay by my side until I wake?
I've never left your side. I'll always be here. Komugi...
Yes, yes? What is it?
Thank you.”
Absolutely phenomenal writing. 
That's about all I have to say about the arc. 9/10
13th Chairman Election Arc- 6/10
Kind of a mixed bag for me. There are two distinct plots to this arc. The first being the election of the 13th chairman, and the second being the revival of Gon. 
The 13th Chairman election half of this arc was pretty bad. It was mostly the introduction of characters (presumably for future episodes), and the time it spends fleshing out the characters isn’t too great. I like nearly none of the characters who are participating in the election, nor do I care about any of them. Also, it seems so… pointless? I mean, electing the 13th chairman should be a huge deal, especially for such a massive organization as the Hunter Organization. However, it's never really established that the chairman possesses any important roles, powers, or responsibilities, so to the audience, it really seems like a meaningless title. 
The Gon revival half of the arc is quite enjoyable. It has some compelling conflict and characters. I really enjoyed the dynamic between Kilua and Alluka with their unconditional sibling affection for each other. (Small nitpick but for whatever reason Illumi refers to Alluka as “he/him” whereas Kilua refers to Alluka as “she/her.” It's likely a small translation error but I figured I’d mention it.) Again, this arc does a good job of establishing rules and manipulating those rules to weave a compelling story. 
13th Chairman election half- 4/10
Gon revival half 7/10
Overall- 6/10
-----
Taking the weighted average of each arc by episode count gives me an average score of 6.5/10 which I feel is a very fair score for the show. Arcs like the Chimera Ant and YorkNew City arc are phenomenal, while other parts are downright bad. I definitely recommend the show for these arcs specifically. The show has a lot, meaning nearly everyone can find some kind of enjoyment out of at least one section of the show. It will be interesting to see if the last manga arcs ever get adapted.",6
"
                Always seen the name Hunter X Hunter floating around various sites and one day just decided to watch it as I was looking for a new anime. And I was not disappointed!
When I first started watching it, nothing really wowed me. But an episode or 2 in, small things in the story caught your eye and interested you, then you realised, you know what, this might actually be a beginning to a great anime and my instincts didn't fail me.
Very good anime, the story line quickly develops a lot. LOVE the music, it really sets the tone for the particular scenario in the episodes. The
                  characters are great and unique and funny! And the character development is great, you actually see them evolve over the course of the episodes. I like the various arcs and journeys. You just won't be disappointed and as a few comments I've seen, very underrated anime, doesn't get as much attention as it deserves.",9
"
                Hunter x Hunter is quite the wild ride. Now, let me preface this by saying that I may be a bit biased, considering I do love me a good shounen.
I feel like the reason I loved HxH so much was because new things kept happening. First, there’s Gon of course, living a secluded life with his aunt. He meets new friends along the way, each having different personalities that fit well together. The Hunter Exam arc had interesting sections, and I never got bored through any of it. In fact, except for maybe a couple of episodes, the whole show was very engaging. Each new
                  arc brought something fresh to the table. And that was why I finished the entire series in a very short amount of time.
The show also focuses on a lot of characters, giving the watcher a good look at the mindsets and personalities of everyone. The POV changes around, so it’s not just our boy Gon (but it’s great when he’s on screen, too). By the end of the anime you come to feel for many of the characters in the show since they were brought in and explained so well.
I also want to take a quick moment to talk about the Chimera Ant arc. You hear a lot of people talking about this arc, and it is quite justified. You can really delve into a land of corruption and violence. Had me on the edge of my figurative seat the whole way through. The storytelling was pretty damn good, not going to lie.
(Minor spoilers)
When Killua asked Nanika to never come out again and it hit me with that sad “kay,” I may have teared up a little. So bonus points.
So yeah, watch this anime. Even if you’re not into shounen, give it a try. It’s one of the only anime I can truly call a masterpiece.",10

                Anime: Hunter x Hunter
tl;dr version: Very Good, only watchable shonen-action anime.
8.5/10 (Very Good)
I am a shonen action anime hater. I have always held the belief that the folks that like naruto,op etc either don't have a good taste or they shut their brains while watching Anime.
Hunter x Hunter is an exception and I mention the reasons below.
Firstly, there isn't an over-powered MC, like who gets beaten by his opponent but he's not actually beaten, he was just trying to test the power of his opponent (referring to the seven deadly sins.)
In hxh everyone has different abilities, so they don't have to rely on only raw
                  power to defeat the anime, instead the fights are dependent on strategies.
For eg: In the fight between Gon and Hisoka, where Gon throws the slab just in order divert his attention in order to hit hisoka.
HxH also doesn't have an useless female character whose only purpose in the show is to be sexually harassment or for showing off tiddies and ass shots (referring to fairy tail/naruto).
No ten minute long power-ups, no unnecessary screaming.
The fights are one or two episodes long not twenty episodes
( referring to DBZ).
The story doesn't get repetitive each arc has completely different setting.
Also there are no never-ending fillers (naruto).
The friendship between Gon and killua has been given proper development unlike naru- susugay.
Animation/art:
The animation quality remains consistent throughout the series unlike other long running shonen.
Good Job Madhouse!
Art style is also good, the characters look distinct and neat.
Negatives:
Lack of a good female character a.k.a waifu material.
Arcs like 13th chairmen arc, zoldylk family arc and greed island lacked proper pacing.
A few characters haven't been given proper screentime and we haven't been told their backstories.
Kurapika is the favorite character.
York new arc is the best arc and Netero vs Mereum is the best fight, in hxh, in my opinion.
P.S. Haven't watched FMA.",9

                After finishing this anime near the start of 2016 and rewatching it again now, i can truly understand why this anime is known as a ""Masterpiece"". Words cannot describe how wonderful, awesome, and fulfilling it is to experience HxH and all that it is. 
STORY [10/10]
i won't talk about the synopsis, as it is there on the info page and many people have covered it already. There are quite a few different story arcs, each with their own unique plots and development that contribute to building the world around HxH. Don't let the first couple of episodes fool you into thinking this anime is your
                  typical shounen-type show. Although it starts a bit light-hearted with the ""Hunter exam"" arc, it definitely builds up and pulls you in, ultimatley leading to the intense ""Chimera ant"" arc that the show is mostly known for. It does a great job in portraying different anime genres and emotions despite being known as a shounen.
However, it is not without its minor flaws. The Chimera ant arc is extremely long, and it suffers from a bit of pacing issues during the arc. The narrator also plays a big factor in the show and this might be off-puting to some. Despite this, HxH still manages to get a perfect score from me, and this is a testament to just how good the plot and overall story-telling is.  
ART [10/10]
The art style is fairly well done, and fast-paced scenes such as battle sequences are fluid and crisp, which allow you to sit back and enjoy what you are watching. i have no problems with the art whatsoever.
SOUND [10/10]
The music and soundtrack of HxH is outstanding, and will make you go on a rollercoaster ride of emotions. From the adventurous Opening song ""Departure!"", to the beautiful musical instrumention of ""Hyori Ittai"", the soundtrack covers a wide variety of genres that add to creating the overall feel of the anime. The background music is amazing, and goes well with each scene shown. Some characters even have their own theme music, which gives them their own individuality and helps the audience to relate to them.
CHARACTERS [10/10]
HxH has some of the most unique and interesting characters in any anime that i've ever watched. From the happy-go-lucky Gon, to the mysterious-and-shady Hisoka, it has characters that almost everyone watching can relate to. The villians in HxH are also well-written, and are on par with the main characters. Not only that, HxH actually builds and develops these characters so that they are constantly learning, evolving, and adapting to whats happening to them and their environment. This makes the audience actually care about what happens to them, and builds a form of attachment to the characters. Even the minor ones introduced are developed in such a way that you learn much about them despite their little time in the spotlight.  
ENJOYMENT [10/10]
At the end of the day, everyone wants to watch an anime that they enjoy and look forward to watching. HxH does this and so much more. Words cannot express how much i enjoyed the journey that HxH took me on, and i was genuinely sad that it had to all end at only 148 episodes. i can only hope and pray that Togashi keeps writing more so that we might have another season of the anime.
OVERALL [10/10]
Although i've had my fair share of anime over the years, only HxH has managed to touch me deeply and resonate within my inner being. It has a special place in my heart for sure. From its loveable characters and amazing story arcs, to its exciting battle sequences and touching moments, i can dare say that it is one of the best animes out there. 
If you haven't picked this up, what are you waiting for? Put on episode 1 and enjoy the epicness that is Hunter x Hunter. im sure this show will impact you, just like it has done to me.",10
"
                Hunter X Hunter is one of the Anime I consider one of the Gems in the never ending spring of Anime. 
I fell in love with Gons Personality at the first Episode and the way this show tells a Story is Outstanding. You can relate to the Cast and it even has an Isekai Arc!
The soundtrack is Memorable and the Opening became something I sang along to, it build up the Hype. 
In terms of Art this Anime is Outstanding aswell. 
If you like Shonen like Dragonball, Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, Katekyo Hitman Reborn, Etc. You definitely going to have a Blast with this one.

"
                Ok, I'm going to try to keep this short. To me, this is undoubtedly the best anime made (as of 28/12/2020). And here's why...
Story: 10/10
The story is split up into 6 arcs
- The Hunter Exam 
- Heavens Arena
- Yorknew
- Greed Island
- Chimera Ant
- Election 
Each of these arcs are amazing. One thing about this show that I really appreciate is that the arcs sort of alternate between being lighthearted and kinda dark. It creates a really nice balance which makes it a lot easier to watch for me. The show also has really nice gradual world building so it never gets too complex and confusing
                  all at once. Overall, you should have no issue understanding the story even if you're new to anime. I've shown this to a lot of people as their first anime, like some of my friends and even my mum, and none of them have been disappointed so far. So even if you're new to anime, this one might be a good one for you.
Art: 9/10
The only reason I'm not giving it a 10/10 for art is mainly because of the high standard we now have for animation in 2020 with shows with incredible animation such as Demon Slayer and Violet Evergarden. This anime is from 2011 but the art isn't dated but it also doesn't reach the levels of animation that we now have. Despite this, it is animated really well. It's clean and crisp and yh I don't really have much else to say on that. The fight scenes look sick.
Sound: 10/10
Hunter x Hunter genuinely has my favourite ever soundtrack in all of anime. I've watched this show at least 5 times so I could probably sing you the whole soundtrack. The OP is legendary. It only really has two op songs and they are both just different sections from the same song but it works. I never got bored of it. Whenever it comes on it just gets me hyped. I feel the same way about the ending songs too. I could go on and on about how great it is and how each part of the soundtrack fitted in perfectly with the story. But, I won't bore you too much and I'll just say it's great.
Characters: 10/10
Our main 4 characters are Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio.
Kurapika and Leorio aren't there for some of the arcs but it's ok because Gon and Killua are. Much like the large majority of Hunter x Hunter fans, Killua is my favourite. The character development in this series is done perfectly, especially for Killua and Meruem (a character you'll meet in the Chimera Ant Arc). The character designs are also some of my favourite in anime because of how they vary, especially in the Chimera Ant arc. You'll know a character is important if they have a cool character design. What I think draws me most to these characters is their relationships with each other, mainly Gon and Killua who share this beautiful friendship. I think it was probably one of the main reasons I enjoyed the show as much as I did.
Enjoyment: 10/10
Well... needless to say I really enjoyed this show. After writing about how great it was I might actually rewatch it again now...for the 6th time...
Overall: 10/10
Obviously. Also I heard there's another anime coming out soon to continue the story but I'm not holding my breath for it. Hopefully! But we'll just wait and see.",10
"
                Hunter x Hunter (2011) is outstanding.
The story is amazing, (especially for shounen standards) following Gon and Killua through 7 different story arcs, all of which tying into each other and re-writing typical shounen story tropes in a unique and highly enjoyable way.
The animation is very good and consistent, maintaining the same quality through all 148 episodes, which is a pretty rare feat for such a long show.
The soundtrack is very memorable and unique, the opening and (most) endings are great, and the voice acting is spot-on. (Even the dub isn't half-bad so far.)
The characters are amazing and compliment each other very nicely. The main characters
                  are very likeable and the villains feel very real compared to other shounen villains, who are usually more one-dimensional. It's hard to even call them ""bad guys"" at some points since HxH blurs the line between ""good"" and ""evil"" so much throughout the story. (The Chimera Ant arc in particular.)
Hunter x Hunter is a very different experience compared to the likes of Naruto and other big shounen franchises. It's truly a masterpiece and I definitely reccommend you watch it if you haven't already, you won't regret it.",10

                NOT SPOILER FREE
I can say one thing for sure- if u do not like shounen or any fighty anime targeted at younger people do not watch this because u simply wouldn't enjoy it. 
HxH is strong when it comes to making appealing characters, i don't even hate the bad people cuz they were given backstory that makes them interesting and i root for them not to die which says a lot about the writting. I think it has many other strong sides such as interesting fights and overall decent main cast, even some side characters are good but its biggest weaknesess might be a no
                  no for some viewers. 
The music in my opinion isnt bad but could use one or two changes- it feels like there are only 5-6 soundtracks on repeat and 3 were added later on which can get repetitive but i really do not mind it as much. 
The show is also split into different arks as any other shounen but sometimes it feels like they drag on for longer than they have to. A good example would be the very first ark that felt like ages and the Green Island one which is unironically my least favorite one. Best arks so far are the Phantom Troupe one and Chimera ant one but they both have their weaknesses but are far better than the others.
The colors are a bit too muted for a shounen which is refreshing to see considering shounen is known for very bright colors.
The art is one of the stronger sides as well, definitely has a strong mid 2000s art which again- up to a personal preference. 
Even with its bad sides i found it very enjoyable to watch, nice way to kill time and be entertained in the meantime. If u are looking for a very deep serious story do not watch it, but if ur looking for a time kill then definitely give it a shot.",7

                I have never took the time to review an anime on here before until I saw this. Everything about this anime is perfect. From the outstanding character development to the awesome battles, not to mention the unbreakable bond between Gon and Killua, this anime has it all.The story is well developed and introduces all of the characters perfectly. From main characters to minor characters, there is in-depth information provided which makes it become much more interesting and exciting to watch. Specifically, the way that Gon and Killua's friendship develops from beginning to end will make you have a great interest in them and will help
                  you understand the meaning of true friendship. As far as entertainment goes is is no doubt a ten out of ten. Typically in every anime there is at least one point in time where the viewer becomes bored with a filler episode etc. However, there is really only one or two filler episodes in the entire series and I have yet to be bored from watching any of the episodes. This show keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I think that this show is extremely underrated and anyone who is skeptical about watching this should because it will have an everlasting impact on you. I will be watching this one over and over for years to come.",10

                SPOILER-FREE REVIEW
**********************
I have not read the manga, so this review is anime-only. 
This is probably the best 100+ anime I've seen. Sure, there are a couple filler episodes, and catering to latest ""trends"" like video games and politics. However, it also contains my favorite episode out of all anime (trust me, you'll know when you see it). 
It starts out quite generic, but don't be fooled - this one is very different from your regular shounen. If you can sit through the first dozen or so introductory episodes - you'll be in for a treat! 
Overall very enjoyable and memorable. Not quite a masterpiece, but
                  was certainly worth my time.",9
"
                To be one of the most famous anime, you need to have genius on all fronts in your film adaptation or the frenzy of fans who mindlessly gave it 10/10. After watching it, I can say with confidence that this children's shounen was showered with high marks by many schoolchildren. Deserved? Hardly. I watched the 2011 version, so my opinion will be somewhat objective, since I have not looked at the Hunters before.
First of all, the plot should be noted - it is divided into story arcs, up to episode 37 it is an exam and adventures. from 38 to 148 - more severe tests
                  of our children. It's boring to watch the adventures, but there was no desire to turn it off. The problem with the arcs is that they are abrupt both logically and scriptfully, leaving a number of questions unanswered as they move on to the next arc. This is especially noticeable after the ""Yorknew City"" and ""Chimera Ant"" arcs. Many fights come down to a quick ending. Some characters are simply ignored and thrown out of the script as unnecessary. All these dialogues for the sake of stretching the timing. Oh how I love that. And also this childish shounen, pressing from all the cracks, which is no longer my age, well, that’s already taste. A number of moments could have been filmed better and told in a more interesting way, but such an audience does not have high requirements for such titles with cries of ""it will do, because this is a masterpiece!""
In general, I have seen more interesting shounen anime, there are too many minor flaws and innuendo. If you are under 18, you may like it, if more, then it is a question of acceptance. Perhaps I will put 6/10, I am not attached to either the characters or the story. And do not forget that the franchise is not over.",6
"
                First off, this review has spoilers.
HxH was the second shounen I've ever seen. I initially watched it because I got so many recommendations saying this was the ""model shounen"" and that it was really good, albeit long.
After taking about a month to finish this show, I can confirm the statements that it is a very good show. You've probably read many reviews going over its, pros, so in this review I'll try to highlight some cons I felt as well.
I'm going to be completely honest and say that the statement: ""HxH gets better as it goes"" is crap. Also, I really believe the chimera ant
                  arc is overhyped. You know that one arc everyone seems to drool over? It's also the longest one in the whole show, stretching about 50 episodes if I'm not mistaken. 
If I were to give the ratings across each arc in the story, I would give it as follows:
Hunter Exam 10/10
Zoldyck Family 10/10
Heavens Arena 8/10
Yorknew City 9/10
Greed Island 10/10
Chimera Ant 8/10 
Chariman Election 6/10
I think HxH started off with a bang. I was instantly addicted, and for the first two arcs, I couldn't stop watching. You get introduced to the energetic Gon, scheming Leorio, and thoughtful Kurapika, and they just seem to conquer everything in front of them. Then we meet Killua, who seems to mesh really well with the trio. He has his own problems eventually get solved due to the tight friendship they all share. There goes the first two arcs.
However once I reached Heavens Arena arc, I feel like it kinda slowed down. I wasn't as hyped up to watch the next epsiode due to the fact that Kurapika and Leorio had left. Also, it kinda seemed pointless. There was no reason they were there other than to earn money and to train, but there just didn't seem to be the same intensity of an end goal that the first two arcs contained. However, I think the fight scenes in Heavens Arena were very well made and it served as a really good way to demonstrate how Gon and Killua trained for their powers, as well as develop Hisoka as a character.
Then comes Yorknew. Yorknew City was also a good arc in my opinion. The duo of Gon and Killua once against meet Leorio, and in this arc we are introduced to the Spiders, who seem unbeatable at first but slowly, the main characters whittle down the resistance and eventually Kurapika gets his revenge. I thought this was very well made, because Kurapika doesn't kill all of them. He gets his revenge in a very subtle way, which I think is clever on the part of the writers. One thing I didn't like however, was that it seemed a little overhyped for what it delivered. For isntance, Kurapika makes a deal with Hisoka to give information, in exchange for information. However, Hisoka doesn't really do anything during this arc. I was expecting a lot more out of this ""deal"" but nothing really occurred and it kinda disappointed me.
Now for my favorite arc, Greed Island. I love how its almost a present from Ging to Gon, and the game itself kinda represents that pure hunter spirit, where Gon learns more about why Ging wanted to become a hunter. I loved the action scenes and the whole issue with the Bomber, (and also how Gon defeats him). Also, who doesn't like Bisky? Not much to be said about this one, its just so unique compared to all the other arcs and very well done.
Now comes Chimera Ant. I felt like the buildup was very well done, with the queen slowly creating more and more dangerous creatures until we have these powerful monsters that are masters of Nen. I liked that. However, I don't like how in this arc we are delayed for such a long time. I think the arc could have been 20 episodes shorter had all the scenes in which nothing important happened got removed. For instance, there was a moment I could remember where I was watching 5 episodes in a row and all of them were just Gon's group sitting outside Meruem's castle, waiting for a moment to get in, which obviously was very boring to watch.
In addition, why can't Kurapika and Leorio get in on this arc in some way? They are main characters right? Like I don't hate Knuckle or Palm or Shoot, but I feel like in this arc they introduced way too many new characters instead of developing the ones that we have already spent so much time with. And all these new characters were only developed shallowly, instead of only a few characters being developed very well.
But I do like how the arc ends, and how there isn't just a clear happy ending. 
Finally, Chariman Election. Man this was just confusing. I really don't like how they just spat out the existence of Alluka like we as viewers were supposed to notice that the first time. Then all of a sudden, Gon is magically healed for no reason other than that Alluka just happened to exist in the world. I really don't like it when anime does this, when there's just a magical factor that solves everything for no reason. This was my main issue with the last arc, also I felt like the chariman election was a little confusing, with its funky system and the new characters that are introduced for no reason whatsoever. The whole time while watching this arc, I was just wondering when Gon would finally meet Ging, and how Kurapika and Leorio were doing. Honestly I feel like this arc could've just been removed, the show is better without it.
Overall, my main issue with the show is that it develops these 4 main characters so well in the first half, but fails to deliver on that promise by completely neglecting two of them (Kurapika and Leorio) and instead introducing so many irrelevant minor characters that personally as a viewer, I don't care about. Like to put it into perspective, the last time a viewer saw Kurapika, who by the way was my favorite character, was in Yorknew City. Like, the 3rd out of 7 arcs. And you call him a main character? Same with Leorio, if we don't count the few moments we see him in the last arc. It just sucks that two out of the four characters aren't really there for half the show, and are instead replaced with random characters that come out of nowhere. Like, instead of having Knuckle and Shoot fight with Gon and Killua during the Chimera Ant arc, how sick would it be to have those two be Kurapika and Leorio? Like there would just be this feeling of continuity that the show seems to miss when it focuses for so long on only Gon and Killua.
Nevertheless, still would recommend. Like I said, I focused a little bit more on the cons since you've probably heard lots of the pros. HxH is long, but its worth a shot especially if you like this genre. 
Thanks for reading!",9

                Hunter x Hunter is either my first or second favorite anime in existence. There's so much to enjoy about the show it's difficult to put it into a simple review. Hunter x Hunter starts of slow, but never feels boring, and lulls its viewer into a false sense of security before breaking the established rules of the shonen genre. Hunter x Hunter is a deconstruction through and through, but instead of relying on viewers to have watched other shows in its genre (something that shows like Neon Genesis Evangelion rely on), it clearly shows you what the shonen genre is supposed to be like before
                  subverting your expectations. The characters are fantastically written, some of them simple, like the comic relief Leorio, some of them being incredibly interesting, like the assassin attempting to escape from his lot in life, Killua. These are only some examples, but I never found myself being disappointed by any of the main cast. The soundtrack of Hunter x Hunter perfectly fits the mood of each arc, with the hunter exam arc soundtrack sounding more adventurous and innocent, while the Yorknew City arc sounds dark and ominous. This is also one of the best looking shonens ever made, with Madhouse showing other animation studios how to stretch their budget for lengthy ventures such as this. The only issue I have with the show is its conclusion, seeing as its an adaptation of an unfinished manga. That being said, the show ends on an extremely satisfying note (can't spoil it), and I would have been fine with this being the end of the entire series. I recommend this anime as highly as I possibly can. A must watch.",10
"
                Hunter X Hunter (2011) is truly one to watch and an instant classic. I think that it is amazing and I will do my best to articulate why.
Let's start with story. Like most newcomers to the show, I thought that it would just be another shounen anime that I'd begin to watch, suffer through for a while and then drop. I couldn't have been more wrong. The first few episodes show a charming enough lad named Gon who wants to take the Hunter exam, following in his father's footsteps. This set up is not particularly unique and is something we've seen many times before. However,
                  Gon's attitude to his father leaving him is. Rather than be filled with contempt or a passionate drive to find him, Gon simply wants to get a piece of what was good enough for his dad to leave him for. After getting to the Hunter exam, we learn more about what a Hunter is. They are people in the pursuit of literally anything of their choosing, be it bounties, cures for diseases or fine cuisine. There Gon meets his soon to be best friend, Killua and that's where the story really takes off. Without spoiling the results of the exam, afterwards the two new friends venture into a fighting arena for a tournament arc. But not one that I expected. Unlike many shounen protagonists, Gon and Killua are far from gods and at different points in the series, get their asses handed to them. The fact that it is very plausible that they could loose any fight really adds to the tension. It is around this time that we learn of this anime's version of 'magic,' a system called Nen. Unlike in other shows where more 'magic'=more power, in Hunter X Hunter, ones ability is determined a lot more on how the use their Nen. Users of Nen are split into six distinct categories which use their power in completely different ways. This allows for a huge variety in abilities, most portraying the  character's own personality. For example, Gon is earnest, straightforward and a little stupid so he uses his Nen to enhance parts of his own body solely    for power. Killua is a trained assassin and is much more conniving and illusive so he manipulates his Nen into an entirely different form for combat. As time goes by the two boys encounter many different and genuinely frightening dangers which are always fresh and exiting. Oh yeah, by the way, this show gets hella violent. Don't let the cute art fool you.
Next is art. I don't really have a lot to say on art. The character animation is superb at showing emotion and the fight scenes are unexpectedly smooth and intence. The people and places all have their own unique look and feel rather than being repetitive and dull.
Sound. Well all I can say on this is that the sound effects are on point. The music, however, is so much more. At first I didn't like the opening theme at all. It seemed to happy go lucky and pepped up. Despite this, since the theme never changes, I started to get attached to it and realized that it really well conveys a sense of adventure and wonder that pairs up with the show perfectly. I did however love the first ending, Just Awake by Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, upon first hearing it and I was sad when it changed but no matter what, the ending always suited the theme and mood of its respective arc. Especially the last two. I still tear up.
The characters are outstanding. I love Gon and Killua. their personalities are so clear and they work so well together as friends with Gon as the happy go lucky imbecile and Killua as the cold detached near sociopathic murderer. What's best about these characters isn't how they are, but how they change. Gon slowly starts to become more balanced, sensible and level headed as the things that he encounters force him to mature. Eventually though, through the death of an ally, Gon breaks. He becomes a cauldron of fury, rage and hatred which pushes him to new limits in combat strength but not without a penalty. Killua, on the other hand has become more compassionate and merciful, just through prolonged exposure to Gon's contagious attitude and it makes Gon's break all the more saddening as we see how it impacts his best friend, seeing a side to Gon that nobody even knew existed and it's clear that just seeing Gon in this state is paining him. I connected to these guys like no-one before and no-one since.
Overall, despite its great length and seemingly innocent introduction, this show is one of my faves and a must-watch for anyone who likes anime.
If you read this review to the end, thanks a lot because it was my first ever. Hope you found it helpful. :)",10

                MASTERPIECE. That is the only word which comes to mind while thinking about this anime. Whenever my friend used to recommend watching it, I used to just ignore him, because I thought this was just another childish shounen.
I could not have been more wrong. This is easily the best shounen and one of the greatest anime of all time.
The first arc is pretty decent, the only disadvantage here is that you have absolutely no idea what kind of crazy shit will happen later in the anime.
Things get even better from the Heaven's arena arc onwards, and just when you think things can't get any
                  better begins the YORKNEW CITY ARC, and that's where you realize that you are watching something truly incredible. Even the first two arcs, which seemed great, now seem like nothing due to the explosive growth in quality of the episodes. The ending song of this arc is my favourite ending of all time. 
BUT THE ESCALATION DOES NOT STOP HERE!
Next comes the Greed Island Arc, which, believe it or not, is somehow EVEN BETTER than the previous arc. If you are a fan of the concept of players being sucked into a game and having to defeat it to escape, then this right here is the best arc in all of anime. If this arc was separately released as a standalone anime, it would have been hailed as the best anime of the ""isekai"" genre.
Next comes the Chimera Ant Arc. It is a massive arc, covering a whopping 61 episodes. But not a single time do you feel bored or drowsy. Cause, guess what, it is even better than Greed Island. A massive number of new characters are introduced, all having their distinct personalities and ambitions, yet you never feel overwhelmed. The climax of the arc features many epic and jaw dropping battles, but something even more beautiful and great happens which I will not spoil. The only thing I will tell you is that the main antagonist is one of the greatest characters ever seen in  anime.
In conclusion, this is one anime you must watch, and I really hope it gets a second season soon.",10
"
                This review is not about technical analysis of the show. I will just say why I think it is an amazing anime.
The strongest point of HxH: FRIENDSHIP - 2 MCs GON & KILLUA
Despite being the most basic/core theme of Shounen genre, most shounens fail miserably in this so called ""friendship"" theme especially the ones involving female characters. They introduce heroine after heroine and put them all into friendzone. What is worse is the ones with ""bleach syndrome"" where there is all kinds of romantic feelings with zero romance at all. It is there, everyone can see it, but romantic feelings are non-existent. It feels so
                  damn forced when someone says ""friendship"" those anime. 
HxH on the other hand has one of the BEST FRIENDS I see in anime. They also happen to be the best duo imho. Many will say Gon is the MC of this story but imo, Killua is also an MC. In fact Killua is more of an MC than Alphonse Elric is. When you see those two kids together you will see how natural their friendship feels compared to others so called shounen friendships. Both characters are so different yet so similar. So distant yet so close. Also the biggest factor is they are equals. One of them does not protect the other, it goes both ways. One does not make sacrifices it goes both ways. The way they fight is cool. Their styles and strengths are completely different and complement each other. They know and understand each other. It is a pleasure to watch those two.
I will not make any point other than that one as many others already talk about it. I just wanted to bring out that aspect of the show to attention.",9

                Hunter X Hunter, I honestly did not imagine an anime that was more perfect in every way than Full metal alchemist brotherhood to the point I said: it is impossible to see a better shounen. 
Until I saw Hunter X Hunter, I was able to risk saying this since it is still not a finished work, since the manga continues, but, Hunter x Hunter IS THE BEST SHOUNEN NEVER CREATED, period. For more than the anime ends with a horrible ending would still be the best shounens ever created. YOSHIRO TOGASHI, You are a fucking genius, I will go to the points I want to
                  highlight. 
1- The story is very complete, without traces that leave you in doubt, without strange things, it is simply what any shounen promises. 
2- With the exception of the arc of greed island, all were extremely incredible reaching completely dense points in history and with continuous evolution of our protagonists (Greed island was not bad, but the weakest). 
3 - The animation is pretty good, it is not the fifth wonder, but it does its job in the important parts, the fights are fucking epic. 
4- And now the main course, which I doubt that in many years or maybe an anime can never beat Hunter at this point. Characters. 
Holy God. 
From the protagonists: With gon and killua 
Secondary: as kurapika and leorio 
AND THE VILLAINS ARE PERFECT There is no other perfect word. Especially speaking of the villains: from pitou, chrollo and Meruem. YOSHIRO TOGASHI thank you for creating a ""Villain"" as perfect as meruem, only then can you define the character. Not only do I consider him the best Villain in the history of shounen, but also the best written characters. The way they present it to us at the beginning, of someone who is only interested in power and who only sees strength as something physical, is cruel wherever you see it. To the point that you may or may not hate it at the beginning, until you see the true meaning of being strong, seeing the value of each person, and being someone comfortably rational and fair. That is why the reason I put it ""villain"" in quotes because the anime conveys the true message of the arc. 
That Meruem's wish was really nothing crazy or crazy and that humans were really enemies. His relationship with Komugi, incredible and the final scene with her amazing. I take off my hat in front of the genius behind Hunter, and I will take off my hat in front of the person who gets to overcome all points mentioned to Hunter, which I doubt will happen.",10
"
                still looking for an anime that can top the addiction of me to this anime,  the anime itself is so great  for most part for its diversity and complication of the story arcs and each characters is very unique,  reach arc is also unique and great in it own way, i was a but sadden by the fact that some characters are only dealt with in a certain arc, after that arc they won't be appearing as much T.T but its so amazing and addictive overall. it certainly make me develop emotions with certain characters when they depart!!!!! my favs are so
                  many: killua, kurapika, bersky, really hoping they will do more episodes",10

                English version:
This is my first review, and although I am not a critic who has watched more than 700 anime,but i want to give my opinion.
Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a remake done by the Madhouse of the 1999 classic, producer of several anime like Kaiji, Tatami galaxy and many others, Hunter x Hunter is an anime shounen among thousands, but it is a special anime, different from these Thousands of shounen who follow a cake recipe that is ""must have blood, fight and breasts"", not that it does not have it, but it works in a different way, the grace is not the blood,
                  the fight or the breasts. The situation does not allow you to be distracted by this, because when the situation is tense, you think more about the tension than on the fight. For example, different from dragon ball, you do not want to see the characters struggling because you care about them, in dragon ball, you want to see the characters fighting because they know they can come back with the dragon balls.
Story: 8
The story of Hunter x Hunter revolves around Gon, a boy who decides to become a hunter and find his father, in a world where there are several creatures, a world to be explored. At first, it may seem an anime full of happines and friendships, but make no mistake, it is a totally unknown and violent world; this comparison may seem a bit silly, but it reminds me of the game ""The  legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"", where you want to see Link fulfilling your goal, but more than that, you being in the adventure matters more. In Hunter x Hunter you want to see, yes, Gon finding his father, but mainly want to see the adventure, the impact of reality, the unknown. It is as if there was a fifth adventurer in this group, and he is YOU, You even care about the people and their goals, but what matters most is the adventure, like, it leaves you in the hype for what will be the next mission of the protagonists, what new will be presented in this world, and Hunter x Hunter is An adventure, you feel it. Hunter x Hunter is an adventure anime, but no one when doing an adventure anime gets a guide to `` HOW TO MAKE AN ADVENTURE ANIME``, only a single rule is needed to have in an adventure anime: you should NEVER Get to the point of not caring about the world of that anime, because the grace of an adventure is precisely you want to know that world, which in my opinion Nanatsu in Taizai was not able to do.Many anime has adventure, and if you compare superficially Hunter x Hunter with Pokemon , they look the same, an exciting adventure, but they are completely different, an adventure should never be something silly and fun, for example, if you want to be adventurous, and want to venture into Brazil, I guarantee you would not leave Alive, because an adventure is to explore unknown places, or at least you have never seen, and the unknown is dangerous. Not only does Hunter x Hunter do this, but also shows how much an adventure in the unknown can be dangerous,Mainly because at first you do not have the slightest idea of what that world is capable of, and you find out, for example, until the beginning of the hunter exam, we had no idea what Hunter x Hunter was capable,When they start the exam: ""Hey, those guys died, do they allow it? They allow CHILDREN to take the exam where they can be killed, fuck,"" then Hunter x hunter shows the true nature of the adventure, something extremely violent, bizarre and unknown .
Art: 10
This is one of the most criticized points in the remake: ""It's very colorful"", but I disagree too much, the animation combined a lot with the anime climate, it's simple to understand. Saga with more comedy and friendship = colorful animation. Saga more tense = dark animation. For me combined too much, because the climate of the anime should not show tension all the time, it would be an anime trying to make you feel scared where it does not exist, and it is worth mentioning how much the madhouse knew how to adapt those Togashi scribbles (creator of the manga).
Sound: 10
The sound is basically perfect, not only for dubbing that is sensational, having myths of dubbing like Kappei Yamagushi, but for transmitting sensations, see the theme song of Gon for example, it conveys adventure, conquest and courage, but the theme music of the Zoldyck For example, conveys fear, superiority and even conveys that everyone is screwed, and that's fine, they use the songs at the right time, and that's very good, transmitting sensations to the viewer, even if you're not in that world.
Protagonists: 10
Perhaps the best point of the anime, they are not used anyway to put on fan-service. A lot of people were annoyed because Leorio was gone for a while, but it does not make sense for him not to disappear, it does not make sense for him to be in the ants war, because he is not strong, he is weak, and this is not bad, after all we all identify with Leorio for being the most normal person, so I love him. 
Kurapika is another character that I love, for two reasons: first to have a power very well done, instead of Togashi giving him a way to turn overpowering making him let go of many powers frantically, he used his scarlet eye well, making his transformation give new powers to him, completely dominating the Nen. The second reason he is so calm, friendly and intelligent usually, but in case he sees a member of Genei Ryodan, he totally loses control, becoming a killer who wants revenge, and it's interesting to see that in him. 
Killua is one of the my favorite characters in the world of animes, and it probably comes from the fact that he is a child and has already had several tortures, and why? To become a professional assassin since he was a kid, he is one of the characters that best reacts to a situation of danger, unlike Gon who is innocent and Leorio who acts on impulse, due to his training, this leaves him very interesting, more for his contrast with Gon, since they are best friends but are totally opposite. 
And Gon is perhaps the most interesting in the group, for running away from cliches, he is not a child of an extinct race, has a fox sealed in it or has an akuma in the mi, even in Greed Islands he has no very special power. He is a normal child, having only his dedication, fishing rod (which is a very funny but very functional weapon) and friends, Gon is a normal child, who does not have much sense of danger, just venturing into the unknown, reminding me of Link. Another break of cliche is the fact that Gon is not the protagonist who wants to save everyone, he sees people to die and does nothing, and we also have in chimera ants, but I will not tell because it is spoiler.
Conclusion: 10
Hunter x Hunter on technical issues is the best anime I've ever seen, his main qualities are: conveying sensations in a sensational way, its characters extremely charismatic, its incredible animation, and especially its enjoyment, you go watching the episodes and when you realize you already finished seeing everything. Of course it is an anime / manga that suffers from the hiatus, but does not change anything in the anime, because we know that we will receive a good thing.
versão português 
Essa é a minha primeira review,e apesar de não ser um crítico que assistiu mais de 700 animes,vou dar minha opinião.
Hunter x Hunter (2011) é um remake feito pela Madhouse do clássico de 1999,produtora de vários animes como Kaiji,Tatami galaxy e muitos outros,Hunter x Hunter é um anime shounen em meio a milhares,mas é um anime especial,diferente desses milhares de shounen que seguem uma receita de bolo que é ``precisa ter sangue,luta e peitos´´,não que ele não tenha isso,mas ele trabalha de uma forma diferente,mas a graça não é o sangue,a luta ou os peitos,e sim que a situação não permite que você se distraia com isso,pois quando a situação esta tensa,você pensa mais na tensidade  do que na luta por exemplo, diferente de dragon ball,você não quer ver os personagens lutando,porque você se importa com eles,em dragon ball não,você quer ver os personagens lutando porque sabe que eles podem voltar com as esferas do dragão.
História: 8
A história de Hunter x Hunter gira em torno de Gon,um garoto que decide se tornar um hunter e encontrar seu pai,em um mundo onde existem diversas criaturas,um mundo a ser explorado,a principio pode parecer um anime cheio de aventuras e amizades,mas não se engane,é um mundo totalmente desconhecido e violento,pode parecer meio bobo essa comparação,mas me lembra o jogo the legend of zelda ocarina of time,onde você quer ver o link cumprindo seu objetivo,mas mais que isso,você estar na aventura importa mais,em Hunter x Hunter você quer ver sim o Gon encontrando seu pai,mas principalmente quer ver a aventura,o impacto da realidade,o desconhecido.É como se existisse um quinto aventureiro nesse grupo,e ele é VOCÊ,tipo,
você até se importa com o pessoal e seus objetivos,mas o que mais importa é a aventura,tipo,ele te deixa no hype para qual será a próxima missão do pessoal,o que de novo será apresentado nesse mundo,e Hunter x Hunter é 
uma aventura,você sente isso. Hunter x Hunter é um anime de aventura,mas ninguém quando vai fazer um anime de aventura,recebe um guia de ``COMO FAZER UM ANIME DE AVENTURA``,apenas uma única regra  é necessária ter em um anime de aventura:você NUNCA deve chegar ao ponto de não se importar com o mundo daquele anime,porque a graça de uma aventura é justamente você querer conhecer aquele mundo,o que na minha opinião Nanatsu no taizai não foi capaz  de fazer.Muitos anime tem aventura,e se você comparar superficialmente Hunter x Hunter com Pokemon,eles parecem iguais,uma aventura emocionante ,mas são completamente diferentes,uma aventura nunca deve ser algo bobo e divertida,por exemplo,se vocês quiserem ser aventureiros,e quiserem se aventurar no Brasil,garanto que não sairiam vivos,pois uma aventura é explorar lugares desconhecidos,ou que pelo menos você nunca viu,e o desconhecido é perigoso.Não só Hunter x Hunter faz isso,mas também mostra o quanto uma aventura no desconhecido pode ser perigosa,principalmente por no começo você não ter a minima ideia do que aquele mundo é capaz,e você ir descobrindo,por exemplo,até o começo do exame hunter não tínhamos a minima noção do que esse mundo de Hunter x Hunter era capaz,ai do nada ``ei,aqueles caras morreram,eles permitem isso?eles permitem CRIANÇAS entrarem no exame onde podem ser mortas,puta merda´´,então Hunter x hunter mostra a verdadeira natureza da aventura,algo extremamente violento,bizarro e desconhecido.
Arte: 10
Esse é um dos pontos mais criticados no remake:``é muito colorido´´,mas eu discordo demais,a animação combinou muito com o clima do anime,é simples entender,saga com mais comédia e amizade=animação colorida
saga mais tensa=animação escura,pra mim combinou demais,por que o clima do anime não deve demonstrar tensão o tempo todo,seria um anime te tentando fazer você sentir medo onde não existe,e vale mencionar que é surpreendente o quanto a madhouse soube adaptar aqueles rabiscos do togashi(criador do mangá).
Som:10
O som é basicamente perfeito,não só pela dublagem que é sensacional,tendo mitos da dublagem como Kappei Yamagushi,mas por transmitir sensações,vejam a musica tema do Gon por exemplo,ela transmite aventura,conquista e coragem,mas a musica tema dos Zoldyck por exemplo,transmite medo,superioridade e até mesmo transmite que ta todo mundo ferrado,e isso é bom,,eles usam as músicas no momento certo,e isso é muito bom,transmitir sensações ao telespectador,mesmo você não estando naquele mundo.
Protagonistas:10
Talvez o melhor ponto do anime,eles não são usados de qualquer jeito para colocar fan-service,muita gente ficou irritada pois o Leorio ficou sumido por um tempo,mas não faz sentido ele não sumir,não faz sentido ele estar na guerra das formigas,porque ele não é forte,ele é fraco,e isso não é ruim,afinal todos nós nos identificamos com o Leorio,por ser a pessoa mais normal,por isso eu amo ele,o Kurapika é outro personagem que eu amo,por dois motivos,primeiro por ter um poder muito bem feito,ao invés do togashi ter dado um jeito dele virar overpower fazendo ele soltar muitos poderes freneticamente,ele usou bem a sua característica de olho escarlate,fazendo sua transformação dar novos poderes a ele,dominando completamente o Nen,o segundo motivo por ele ser bem calmo,amigável e inteligente normalmente,porem caso ele veja  algum membro da  Genei Ryodan,ele perde totalmente o controle,se tornando um assassino que quer vingança,e é interessante ver isso nele,Killua é um dos meus personagens favoritos no mundo dos animes,e provavelmente vem pelo fato dele ser uma criança e já ter passado por varias torturas,e por que?para se tornar um assassino profissional,isso desde pequeno,ele é um dos personagens que melhor reage a uma situação de perigo,diferente do Gon que é inocente e Leorio que age por impulso,devido ao seu treinamento,isso deixa ele muito interessante,mais pelo seu contraste com o Gon,já que são melhores amigos mas são totalmente opostos,e o Gon é talvez o mais interessante no grupo,por fugir um pouco dos cliches,ele não é uma criança de uma raça extinta,tem uma raposa selada nele ou tem uma akuma no mi,até em Greed Islands ele não tem nenhum poder muito especial,ele é uma criança normal,tendo apenas sua dedicação,vara de pesca(que é uma arma muito engraçada,mas muito funcional) e amigos,Gon é uma criança normal,que não tem muita noção do perigo,apenas se aventurando no desconhecido,me lembrando o Link,outra quebra de cliche é o fato do Gon não ser aquele protagonista que quer salvar todo mundo,ele vê pessoas para morrer e não faz nada,e também temos em chimera ants,mas não vou contar porque é spoiler.
conclusão:10
Hunter x Hunter em questões técnicas é o melhor anime que já vi,suas principais qualidades são:transmitir sensações de uma forma sensacional ,seus personagens extremamente carismáticos,sua animação incrível ,e principalmente o seu divertimento,você vai vendo os episódios e quando percebe já terminou de ver tudo,claro que é um anime/mangá que sofre com os hiatos,mas não muda nada no anime,pois nós sabemos que vamos receber coisa boa.",10

                It is very good until the 5th season. After that, it begins to drag until the point that it feels like I've been watching the same episode for 10 hours. If I were just to rate the first 4 seasons, it would be 5 stars without a doubt but the 5th season is just so unbelievably slow and boring, that I just can't ignore it. I would rather have spent that time watching 2 dudes having sex. In fact, I'm surprised I haven't seen that yet with Hisoka and Gon.
I can't say it the best anime I have seen since I have watched a lot
                  but this definitely does compete for the top 10 of the hundreds of animes I have watched and apparently yet another arc is to come and if that is so if it as well made as to the first few arcs this will definitely be in the top 5. 
it had a few issues-
1.	Took some time to adjust to the music but after 30+ eps I started to love it
2.	Animation quality is top-notch, does not improve much over the course but great 
3.	Story is not that good but this is not important because when you realize that you will be more invested in the characters rather than the story 
4.	Narration is like 30% of an average HxH episode so you should get used to it but if you don’t pay attention you might not understand the plot.
5.	Arcs- there are seven of them (if you include zoldyck family arc which is like 4-5 episodes maybe). Out of 7 arcs I would say 2 are great/outstanding (82 episodes; Chimera ant and phantom troupe), 2 are fine-good (24 episodes; Chairman election and Heaven's arena), hunter exam arc (regular shounen anime and down) is the starting arc but don’t get too hyped cause this might force you to drop the anime but it is the starting but it gets A LOT better during phantom troupe arc which is like the 3rd one and doesn’t even ask about greed island it's pretty boring but keep in mind you can't skip any of these because it's important.",6

                Story 9/10
Like FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, the story is just perfect. The story follows the adventures of Gon, where he searches for his father and in order to do that, he decides to become a hunter.
The story has many arcs, in which all the story arcs are nice and consistent. My two favorite arcs are Chimera Ant and Greed Island.
The story is nice and consistent and I have not felt bored at all because of the series length (the series has 148 episodes). But, I felt like they could've done the ending better, which is why my score for story is 9/10.
Art 10/10
the art is really
                  colorful and everything is nicely done and consistent. The fight scenes are hilarious at times while also being able to keep its serious tone.
Sound 10/10
The music matches perfectly the anime series. From openings to fight scenes to endings. My favorite opening is the first one. But all of the soundtrack is just really good. I really can't find a flaw or say much here.
Character 10/10
A common complaint that I hear in shonen anime is that they don't really develop their characters. Well, not in this one and not in FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. For each story arc in Hunter x Hunter, you have different characters but yet the characters end up being very memorable in their own ways and they are very well developed. If you ask me what's my favorite character in Hunter x Hunter, it's a tough question, but I really liked Killua and Biscuit. And well, I'll admit one of my favorite villains is Meruem. But honestly, it's hard to answer that question 'cause I loved all of the characters in the series.
Enjoyment 10/10
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and this is one of the best animes I've ever seen along with FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Everything about this anime is just good.
Overall 10/10
I recommend this anime to any anime fan. If you like Hunter x Hunter, then I also recommend you watch FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, as they are both really good series.
Thanks for reading. Let me know your thoughts on this review and any feedback you may have for me. Until next time!",10

                (SOME SPOILERS BE WARNED)
1: nen is a complex system and is the most complicated and intriguing power system out there.  the battle with Gon vs Pitou is normally just am asspull by the main character against a villain.  However because of the system that was implicated it is highly hinted at that people have the ability to put their lives on the line for an increase in power.  And i'm not talking in a power of friendship way but in a sacrificial way which is apparent with Kurapika vs Uvo and Gon vs Pitou.
2: animation...it's Madhouse what should you expect other than
                  phenomenal art, animation, and op/ed's
3: this is my last main reason and that would be the characters, especially the antagonists of the series.  While the protagonists are top tier and all bring something new with them that doesn't fit the ""generic"" shounen protagonists, the villains transcend maybe any anime in terms of how many good one;s there are in 148 ep.  Meruem is a prime example with being basically a mirror reflection of are best boy Gon.  He slowly grows to become more human and realize his identity while Gon slowly goes insane and begins to lose his humanity.  This is the only show I've seen where the main antagonist and main protagonist don't even meet but the contrast and comparison between them is very apparent.  However, Meruem isn't a character that only shines with Gon, he is a character that has many struggles to overcome and his own goals to achieve within these 60 ep that are given.  This would include all his relationships such as with Komugi and with his guards, his struggle to find an identity other than just the role he has been given, and him becoming humble, with amazing character development, that would make him from a tyrant to a true king.  Also, a tear jerking ending.  There is so many more aspects I'd like to say about Meruem too but he isn't the only villain in Hunter x Hunter they are all very well written and some to the same extent as the king himself.  And I forgot to add that his name means something like, ""the light that illuminates all"".  Like how cool is that?

                When you do not differentiate between reality and fiction, when the imagination of the book is physically embedded in front of your eyes, and even when you examine one person or your soul transcends the heavens joy to another. Here the artwork is successful by all standards! (Hunter X Hunter) Raised the platform of the anime artwork and shouted vigorously in the most complex plots and the most contradictory and brutal human traits. 148 episodes of continuous incarnation of professionalism and experience. Whether in drawing, entanglement or psychological confusion of characters during events. Today we give you a comprehensive and concise review of that timeless
                  watch!
Hunter is the undisputed No. 1 in my TOP10 list. Simply an integrated work of art that combines the sobriety of the idea and its entanglement, the splendor and relevance of music, the accuracy of weaving people's past and their complex interactions with each other. All this made that anime deserves that ranking and well-deserved. Now what are you waiting for! Go here if you want to watch it in Arabic, and go here if you want to watch it in English. In both cases, wonders and horrors await you like you have never seen in your life! That's why we anxiously follow the seasonal anime works that appear on the scene frequently during the year, merging with them and waiting for their weekly episodes with a mixture of enthusiasm and excitement. Of course, not all works can be equal in strength or artistic rank. Every anime has something special to distinguish it from its peers who are shown with it in the same season. This anime can be characterized by the supernatural quality of drawing, and this music can be a piece of the pieces (Beethoven) captivating, and also can be a point of excellence on the artistic plot and dramatic escalation of the story and characters of the work of art, and finally can be what distinguishes this particular artwork is Output quality, the director here used the ingenious camera angles that turn that fragile plot into a first-class cinema masterpiece. Characters
Hunter has a mixed and different set of characters, each with its own character and character.This allowed the manga to take many sudden turns, recounting the character's background and its impact on the story in proportion to the fantasy world in which she lives. In addition, it is possible to observe the cultural, civilizational and moral diversity of personalities, their different levels, as well as their volatile psychological situations and the way they deal with difficulties, which gave them rather real dimensions.
So we rarely find anime that combines all these elements of excellence. But in fact there are some works in the history of the anime industry that brought together all of these elements to make a mix we call the (mix of the best). Each anime has these elements in proportions, but only one that reaches the stage of excellence, to be the hallmark of this particular anime. When all these elements are in the stage of excellence in just one artwork, here we should have a pause. The clustering of these elements in one place does not necessarily produce high-quality anime, but the secret to the balance between those elements of superior quality. When these elements run in a longitudinal way next to each other, it is difficult for art makers to achieve the “best mix” we want. But when the plot is intertwined and bifurcated and its events take a different temporal and spatial dimension, here we are really faced with a difference in the history of the anime industry, dear ones.
Yeah, I will say right now what is on your mind now, that Hunter X Hunter is one of those works of art that are considered milestones in the history of the anime industry. It is the anime that achieved (the best mix) in a very distinctive manner and over 148 full of pleasure, enthusiasm, tears, sorrows, laughter, and courage and every human feeling can affect any person in this life. We all started with the little Gun, who set out from Pisces Island to try his life and find his father the fisherman who left him as a baby in order to continue his life as a free fisherman. In order to achieve this great endeavor, we had a very long journey with a young green girl. We went with him from one place to another and met with dozens of personalities, each of whom left a real imprint in us and gave us unforgettable life lessons. Physically intruding in front of your eyes, even when you are sobbing for one character or your soul exceeding the heavens is a joy to another. Here the artwork is definitely successful by any standard! (Hunter X Hunter) Raised the platform of anime artwork and shouted in strength and power in the most complex plots and the most contradictory and wild human qualities. 148 episodes of continuous incarnation of craftsmanship and expertise. Whether in drawing, entanglement, or psychological clutter of characters throughout events. Today we offer you an extensive and con",10

                This is my in-depth review of Hunter x Hunter, with as little spoilers as possible. 
My favourite anime of all time for a long time standing. There are so many good things about it and I really cannot recommend it enough. 
The depth in its story and characters is unrivalled. The chimera ant arc is undoubtedly a masterpiece. Layered with depth with all its symbolism, criticism on humanity and society and a great narrative about perspectives. 
Story: 
Hunter x Hunter is - above all else - a thrilling story about perspectives. Every character is well fleshed out and layered, each goes through their own development
                  - be it in a positive or detrimental way. It is unbelievably refreshing to see that for once, the villains aren't out to get at the world or the protagonists ""for the sake of being evil"". It's refreshing that for once, the villains don't give a flying f*ck about Gon, his friends and his stupid little adventure. The villains are their own characters - not an obstacle that the protagonists have to overcome. They have their own goals in life - it's simply a matter of them having conflicting ideals to the protagonists that makes them ""villains"". The story is without a doubt a 10/10
Characters (and a little extra rambling):
No character in the anime is entirely good or entirely bad. There are blurred lines between hero and villain. The first time watching, you may think Gon is your typical one-dimensional shounen protagonist, but upon further inspection, you'll find that he is not. He is in every sense of the word a child. Selfish, innocent, hypocritical and narrow-minded to the core. Alexcandr on youtube does a brilliant analysis of his character and skewed moral compass. 
Togashi uses Gon's complete childishness and plonks him into the Hunter X Hunter world - a cruel and unforgiving place that mirrors our own. It's fascinating to watch. I could go on and on about each and every character, but there are dozens of youtube videos and reddit threads that you can read about each character after you're done watching. Characters are very three dimensional and layered. 10/10
Art: 
The art is solid and consistent throughout the anime, without any moments that appear rushed or like there has been a sudden drop in budget. The art isn't as brilliant as say - Shingeki no Kyojin, Mob Psycho or Kimetsu no Yaiba, but it's still pretty damn impressive. An 8.5/10
Sound: 
Beautiful, memorable soundtrack. I lsitened through the OST and for the first time I recognised every single one. They're emotional and warm-hearted exactly when they need to be. Blends beautifully with the narrative. A solid 10/10 
Enjoyment: 
Absolutely love it. Some parts are admittedly slow, but it has decent pacing. The greed island arc is a well needed pace-breaker between two of the heaviest and darkest arcs in the anime. Trust me, greed island was a well-needed breather before the chimera ant arc where all hell breaks loose and Togashi hits you with every ounce of his mastery. There are lots of funny, heart-warming moments in between the heaviness of the ideas presented throughout the anime. 
A 9.5/10.
Overall a 10. Absolute masterpiece. I feel as if those who didn't enjoy Hunter x Hunter as much didn't grasp the depth of the story or didn't care for it at all. If you're into that kind of thing, you'll love it. 
--- From here on there will be minor spoilers for the CA arc, but they will be as minimal as possible---
You may have heard of either overwhelmingly positive - or negative reviews about the much-talked-about Chimera Ant arc. I'd just like to point a few things out.
A lot of people seem to dislike the CA arc. I can see why. Madhouse followed the manga religiously, and where there is ""narration"" in the manga for the CA arc, it works in the manga, since you can read at your own pace - and it just works. In the anime adaptation, it does its work brilliantly in some points - but at other points, it slows down the pacing to a snail's pace, and there are a lot of areas where I think the narrator is redundant because we can see what the character is doing. There definitely could have been some areas where there was more ""show"" and less ""tell."" Hxh is by no means perfect, but it's still phenomenal. No other anime has resonated so much with me. I can't even begin to tell you how emotionally invested I am with these characters. 
I digress, but CA arc has been labelled a masterpiece because of how thematically deep it is. 
It's extremely nuanced and rich with themes about the different sides of humanity. The ending song, ""Hyori Ittai"" for the CA arc literally means ""two sides of the same coin"" - referring to the fact that monster and human are just two sides of the same coin. You'll see it all throughout the arc. You might also notice some character parallels - look out for them, they're great. I'll give you a clue - it's between Meruem and Gon. And boy is it brilliant. 
There are some points where all the characters in the room are developing at the same time, and it is pretty damn crazy. It gets dark though. Very dark.
And also, Leorio and Kurapika do not appear as much throughout the adaptation because Togashi switches his characters in and out of the story as the characters go about chasing their goals - as I mentioned earlier, this is a story about perspectives - goals. Whilst some characters do the things they need to behind the camera, the spotlight moves to the most interesting action out of the 4 protagonists. For the majority of the time this is Gon and Killua since they have the most interesting 'current objective' out of the four protagonists (Leorio's studying to become a doctor, Kurapika is looking for leads on the phantom troupe). In the current manga arc, the focus is on Kurapika. 
We might get an arc on Leorio, or Leorio and Kurapika... if Togashi ever finishes Hxh (the author has some serious back issues and is in bad health). 
That was quite the rant, but I hope I've convinced you to give it a shot :)",10

                          Manga (and comics) is a media that has been widely disregarded by adults and critics because of its childish art, or target audience (which are mainly kids and teenagers). This is especially true for Hunter x Hunter as it was published in weekly shonen jump. A first glance at this anime has put off many viewers. But for what seems to be a kid's show, underneath it lies a rich story masterfully executed, characters so unique and likable, and themes so profound and relevant. 
          We
                  begin our story with the protagonist Gon Freecss as he embarks on a journey to find his dad. But as they point it out in the anime itself, it's never truly about the destination, but rather the journey and the people you have experienced them with. The story is very structural at first glance. There is a clear beginning, middle, and end, separated with arcs that flawlessly flow into the next one. One thing the author does here is that he uses the first few arcs to set up the universe, and the characters. He then meticulously develops each character throughout the series which might be a slow pace for some people, but is absolutely necessary for a big payoff at the later parts in the story.
          Speaking of characters, that would probably be my favorite thing about this series: Character development. It's safe to say that you'd like almost all of the characters. Whether they are villains, allies or just the henchmen, each character has a clear motivation to do what they are doing. Some are righteous and some are devious, and all of them act within their nature without becoming too one dimensional. 
          All in all I would say this is a must watch for anyone who likes a masterfully crafted story, whether you're an anime fan or not. And if you invest enough time in this series it will easily earn a spot in your top 10 list guaranteed.",10

                Hunter x Hunter is a clusterfuck of perpetually unfulfilled potential. I think the general framework behind what it means to be a Hunter, the use of Nen, and the animal kingdom make for a great stage. Unfortunately these aspects were never looked at carefully, and instead were only used as tools to make another generic shonen.
Given that there already exists the old show, the goal of the new edition should have been to improve on the older episodes and finish the story. Which to many, they did: obviously they completed the story of the manga, and gave the animation new touches... but making an anime
                  have a generic modern look doesn't mean the art is any better, so I don't see any improvements. For those who think the original beginning is too slow, I (along with many others) was originally interested in the show because of the intro scene with Gon and Kite, as I saw thought-provoking potential in this scene. Alas, anime remakes tend to adhere to an action-addicted audience, removing the character development found in the slower episodes and replacing them with flashy animation and slow motion fight scenes (the emphasis on fighting is not AS BAD as Naruto and DBZ, but does "" not as bad""=""good""?). 
The animation is fine. It's not interesting, nothing stands out as shockingly different or beautiful. It is top notch in terms of budget and cleanliness, but certainly not noteworthy for style. The voices are great, music not so good.
There is an enormous cast of characters, and most are given at least a few episodes to be somewhat developed. This is probably the strongpoint of the series. That being said, I really find that the main characters only become more ridiculous than the beginning of the show. My favorite character was Netero, who met my expectations of a great character.
Story.... it pains me to truthfully say I didn't enjoy it. I can't believe how the philosophy of being a hunter is completely side-swiped. Such a shame. Instead of embracing such an innately interesting topic, the aspect of hunting is abused just to carry Gon from one arc to the next. 
Hunter x Hunter is very strange in how the arcs are so different from one another. The way they are set up, each arc is incredibly distinct from the last once it begins. I have seen many reviews in favor of this, and I just don't understand why. This is a classic taboo in storytelling that seemed to be successful only by stuffing all the Shonen things into one story: young boy characters, video games, aliens, crime syndicates, magic... yet after the Greed Island arc I found myself thinking ""that was pointless"", and the complete separation of the Chimera Ant arc made it difficult to watch.
I actually really liked the show up through Yorkshin city, and I even thought Yorkshin was the best arc (probably a rating of of 8ish). Hisoka, Chrollo, and the other spiders were good antagonists, and like others tend to rave about, Nen seemed like a magical super power that was a little more interesting than the ones found in other Shonen. All of these pluses get completely shit on by the end of the show.
The Chimera Ant arc in particular really sealed the deal for a lower rating. You find yourself asking (in this order) ""Why does this matter? What happened to the main antagonists? Maybe there will be some interesting insight into animal nature? Wait, how did Gon and Killua just happen to get involved in this event? Is it really going to get more Shonen than it has already become?..."" Nen becomes just like every other superpower, Gon goes super saiyan (which is fitting since Meruem is basically Cell), and NO use of the ants biology to ask bigger philosophical nature/nurture questions. Ugh.
Finally for those who praise the epic nostalgic words of Meruem and Ging: this is a writing cop-out of diving into the meaning of the story. After any long dreary story, one can say ""life is about the journey, not the destination"". That's why there are thousands of tramp-stamps out there with that exact quote. Say it over a montage of the 148 episodes of said journey, and TADA! You've got yourself a suckered audience. Every lengthy anime can do this...
If you are pretty set on giving Hunter x Hunter a try, I recommend simply watching the original incomplete version. While finishing that series may leave you wanting closure, you won't find it in this version either. The best arcs are in the original, and you get a better less-cliche feel for the characters. 
If you disagree with my comments, please let me know what I may have been missing.",6

                Short Review: (basically no spoilers)
It boils down to this, Hunter X Hunter is a flawed masterpiece, and quite probably the best shonen ever. 
Baseline quality: 10/10. Superb, probably the most well-rounded and philosophical Shonen anime. Weighed down to 9.4/10 by some minor issues.
Why I gave it this score: If not for certain arcs a little too messy/too long, I would have given it a perfect score. 
Pros:
+ Thoughtful. Probably the most thoughtful Shonen with deepest world-building/characterization among its rivals. It overcomes many issues plaguing the Shonen genre (e.g. pure power fantasy of Dragon Ball where one's energy level dictates all; paper-thin characters yelling nonsensical hothead
                  slogans like Saint Seiya/Gurren Lagann/Back Arrow; misleading depiction of ""pure will power"" overcoming all obstacles...). Instead, Gon is a satire/deep reflection on Goku/Gohan archetype. At the end of his story in the anime, it could be felt that he's overcome his 12-yr-old power-fantasy phase, with hard lessons learned. Not to mention other solid and layered side characters.
+ Dialectically hedonistic. Pursuit of joy/fulfillment is examined from different perspectives, with the last episode driving the theme home with a bang. 
+ Killua, probably the best Shonen character ever. 
+ Chimera Ant arc and York New arc. The depth and suspense easily rival some of the classic detective/adventure/Wuxia stories. Louis Cha would be proud of Hunter X Hunter for (probably inspiring) these well-written arcs.
+ One of the most hopeful/encouraging endings (considering the author might not be able to finish Dark Continent arc, I will just take the anime ending as the canon ending).
Cons:
- Problematic adaptation of Kite and Gon's origin story. Arguably the showrunners did this on purpose to illustrate Gon's flaws/mental issues.
- Pacing is off in the Chimera Ant palace invasion episodes. I honestly cannot imagine following this arc on a weekly basis (instead, I am lucky to have binged it in a few sittings). 
- A few elements felt tropey, underdeveloped or rushed. Especially in the Greed Island arc.
- Even as a Seinen, certain parts can be very disturbing/guidance needed (e.g. the two innocent kids getting brutally eaten in the beginning of a certain arc). Though nothing is out of step with the show's overall tone. So this is only a minor complaint. In fact, all ""cons"" here are minor complaints.
Conclusion: A youtuber called Hunter X Hunter the best Shonen ever. I have to agree after finishing the show.",9
"
                It's a solid series. I actually recommend this a 10/10 to watch since the first half of the anime is FANTASTIC. It's the last 2 arcs that really drag my rating down, which I can't fully explain in this review because spoilers. But fite me anytime I don't mind. Let me repeat though. Story, character, and enjoyment before the final 2 arcs is straight up 11/10.
One thing I can point out right now though is the use of the narrator. The use of the narrator later on in this series is really, really annoying. They get extremely lazy with their story telling at a certain
                  point, which is why my final enjoyment score is an unusual 7/10. Budget cuts? I'm not sure.
The story, or I should say, premise is wonderful. I love the progressions that each character makes. There's physical, moral, and psychological struggles that each character faces, both heroes and villains. The story direction is written such that most things are explained and are logical before they happen, so there are almost no ""that's bullshit"" moments. On the flip side sometimes you may feel they are explaining too much.
Art is good. Character designs can't be helped, it's an old manga. However, the animations are tight, lending to some great fight scenes.
Sound is good and believable. Music is fantastic.
Characters. There are a lot to love about the characters in this series. Each one is (on some level) believable and rational in their line of thinking, but the series does a good job in keeping you on edge about what's to come.
Overall 8/10. My favorite characters are Kurapika and Komugi.",8
"
                Hunter x Hunter is a great Shonen and I recommend to anyone who likes action with a bit of humor. The story is well-written, the world building is great and also well explained. It's not to hard to keep up with all the new aspects of the world because they are presented to you progressively.
I have to say though that I could live without the Chimera Ants arc and the last season. The Ants arc is disturbing, long and annoying. I think the last season is still a good season and we learn a lot more about one specific character, which was very interesting, I
                  think it ends poorly and it seemed like it was rushed to get to the ending.
What I particularly liked about this anime is that seasons are very separated by arcs, but still manages to stay in the storyline. 
The characters have all widely different personalities and strengths. Although the main character is not my favorite, he did bring some interesting thoughts in the anime. His personality was very constant throughout the anime and his goal was very clear from the start. My favorite thing in this anime is the ""bromance""/queer coded relationship between Gon and Killua, the two young kids who bond over their age and strengths. Both of them who legit die for each other and it really shows in the series. I really enjoy their intimacy and the way their relation was portrayed on screen. 
The fights were smart and very enjoyable. They didn't only rely just on strength and use it at the right times. I thought the powers were really brilliant, they were fun to understand and well-explained. They were creative and unique. 
Even with the two seasons that I think could be removed or redone, I still enjoyed it thoroughly and I can safely rate this in my top ten. I've watched the first 4 seasons four times because they are light enough to be really fun. I've watched season 5 and 6 twice in total and the second screening of the Arc chimera was truly a pain.",10

                ---kind of spoilers but not really---
I think that this series will go down as one of my favorite anime of all time. Truly, I enjoyed every single moment of this show. Its baffling to me that this anime has not received the recognition it deserves! The character development in this series was truly astounding, seeing Gon go from this pure sweet kid just trying to find his dad into this terrifyingly powerful, ruthless warrior. The fight scenes in this anime never failed to intrigue me! Every character felt so unique and fresh and I loved the ""nen power"" concept that was used and how it
                  truly transformed the characters. Every arc had interesting content and introduced us to new faces that were unforgettable with their unique powers and personalities. There were also a lot of plot reveals and twists that made this anime spectacular! I feel like the ending of the series was kind of a cliffhanger but in a good way (I won't spoil it), and I would be happy even if they never add another season. I loved the friendship that Gon shared with Killua and they were able to go on so many amazing adventures that shaped their characters and made them even stronger. It is a true masterpiece and an anime that I have rewatched many times and I will probably end up watching again due to my connection with the amazing set of characters this series has provided!",10

                So many people hold this anime in high regards for very pitiful reasons but enjoyment is a subjective thing. HxH is your typical shonen anime combined with more genres. That is a thing why many people rate this high but in my opinion it is also HxH's downfall.
(Little spoilers ahead / Arc description)
We start this anime as cheery, comical. Simple goals, simple characters. With mix of seriousness represented by side characters (one of which gets his things resolved later in the anime, other never gets screen time until very end of the anime where he acts only as comical relief) Then we meet characters that
                  are much more complex that MC like Hisoka. Hisoka carries whole 2 arcs on his back because Gon is shallow, uninteresting and retarded (yes he is small kid so I guess he has a right to be).
First arcs are shitty copy-pasta of YuYu Hakusho (watch that instead if you did not).
Then we have arc that acts sorta like thriller. Interesting concept but with meh end. 
Then we have arc in virtual word. So kinda Matrix/MMORPG anime.
Then we have sci-fi DBZ ripoff with random serious moments.
Then we have ""political"" arc with conclusion of side characters.  
This anime dips its toes in many genres but never finishes anything in satisfying matter. Side characters like Kurapika and Illumi are much more interesting and complex. MC and his fuccboi Killua are shallow typical shonen protagonist (Killua was interesting in first 2 arcs then he became copypasta of Gon but more edgy and calm at the same time.)
What I am trying to say is that this anime starts so many things at once that it is just throwing random things that make not much sense in the end. You are watching DBZ then random sidecharacter has one whole episode about existentional crisis and nihilistic point of view of the world. Sure it is interesting to think about but there is almost no cohesion among all arcs. 
It is like somebody was experimenting how much edgy and dark they can make an shonen anime. Sometimes it is good concept and you meet few episodes that make you feel or think about things but, in my opinion, it is not worth to wait 148 episodes for it when you can watch some short 13ep anime and get what you want from it. 
Sound 8
Music 8 I really like the opening song.
Animation 7 Sometimes very sloppy but most of the fighting time was animated well
Character 5 Complex background on side characters and much more interesting plots than MC plot. 
Enjoyment 6 Most episodes well alright. About 30 were unnecessary, boring and very predictable. About 10 episodes from 148 had real value.
Overall 5 I wouldn't recommend this anime for anyone. I would recommend YuYu Hakusho instead.
TLDR:
If you like One Piece, Fairy Tail, etc... you will not see any flaws in this anime, you will rate it 10 and yell at me.",5
"
                This show was trash. I dont say that to just say it, I mean objectively it was no good. At the end of the show everything felt pointless. In the beginning it felt as if this could be good and it was just downhill from the build up of everything. 
 Pacing was good until the chimera arc. I enjoyed every character more then I did gon. Some of the main characters kurapika and leorio are barely in the show and they were better characters than gon. 
 I couldnt imagine watching this as it came out with the amount of time wasted
                  over explaining everything in the chimera arc. The narrator was the main point of the show. They should have just made a character for the narrator. 
 This show was so passive in action especially with gon, the main protagonist, the one you want to shine and come out victorious. 
 I was very irritated watching this show. I was nodding off to many times while watching.",1
"
                After seeing the praise this show gets online and being recommended to me by a couple of friends I started watching Hunter x Hunter. At first, I dropped this show within the first 3 episodes due to being slow and uninteresting. After a while, decided to watch this show again and was blown away. Starting with the exam, every arc seemed better than the last and I couldn't stop watching this show. When the yorknew city arc ended I was so excited to see if anything could top this in this show, and there were still around 90 episodes.
Sadly no arc came even close to
                  my enjoyment with the phantom troupe. Greed island killed my hype for the show because all the card system seemed dumb even though the idea of greed island seemed brilliant.
 Even though it really picked up by the end, and the dodgeball scenes were great. And then the Chimera Ant arc ... Going into this arc I already read that the narrator was kinda irritating and it was slow-paced but also lots of people praised its character development, the fights, how much the series become serious and dark. I was kinda hyped to see ""the best arc"" to pick up the show for me. 
But after starting watching this arc it lost me immediately. The starting episodes were kind of intriguing but I disliked the idea of insects but it didn't remain as a 
problem. What did remain as a problem is the horrible pacing and the unnecessary and annoying narrator. Even though we spent 2 episodes nothing would happen. The story felt like nothing was happening. Whenever something happened the narrator wouldn't shut up.
I felt like I was listening to an audiobook. It was every action and every thought, the narrator would explain to me what I was already seeing and what I already understood.
Let me analyze the characters, let me feel the emotions. I felt like there was no meaning in trying to understand the scenes since the narrator explained every single little detail. Even though there are amazing fights in this arc, the way the show showed how these events happened, make my love for the show disappear. And the ending was felt so unsatisfying, all the buildup, all the wait ended in a disappointment ( even though I'll admit it was heartwarming) 
The last arc was good but because I was already feeling worn out due to the disaster of the last arc. And how gon met his father felt anticlimactic, he was supposed to find his father but it kinda happened out of luck because of the election.
The ending was a pretty good conclusion and hearing the story continuing in the manga seems unnecessary to me.
I like the characters, the world, the hunter system and it was going strong. 
Other than the pacing and the story issues, my only issue would be the sound. I really liked most of the ost, a small part of the ost was so bad that it ruined some scenes for me. And the good songs were so overused they bored me and lost their effect on me.
This show could have been a 9 or 10 easily but spending around 70 episodes feeling trapped down with the other issues combined destroyed my enjoyment for the show. I haven't read the manga yet, I really hope the manga can revise my love for this show.",7
"
                I actually feel guilty about giving this anything lower than a ten, but I actually do have my reasons. To begin with: before I watched this series, I had an aversion to any long series. I went through a phase where I was even too lazy to watch series that were 24 episodes. After all, I have a particular obsession with having to finish every single show I watch, and the length of some shows makes it hard for me to do. To say the least, this show broke my short show streak, and now I don't know if I can go back to short
                  series. I think short series miss a lot of the character development and love you develop for the characters when compared to long series. 
Anyways, I've ranted enough about that. WARNING: This is going to be a rambling, detailed review, but I will not include any spoilers. This is specifically aimed at people who are apprehensive about watching this show, whether because of the length or some of the floating opinions. I will do my best to make this unbiased. :) 
The story was well written. The show is split up into different arcs, starting with (some of these might be slightly wrong names) the Exam Arc before moving onto the Zoldyck Family Arc. Both of these arcs deal with character development and set up the rest of the series very well. Next is the Heaven's Arena Arc, where we get introduced to nen, the 'power' that the characters develop and fight with throughout the rest of the series. The Phantom Troupe Arc introduces a massive new cast of characters that will probably continue popping up forever, which technically isn't a bad thing. It also creates a lot of character development for Kurapika. The Greed Island Arc is reminiscent of Sword Art Online, but much better. The most controversial and longest arc, the Chimera Ant Arc, takes over the anime for a good 60 episodes with gore and tears before finally closing it off with the Election Arc. Why did I go through all these arcs? Well, honestly, each arc can be treated as its own season, and some arcs even as their own separate anime. For people who aren't interested in watching the whole thing, I would recommend specific arcs to them, it all depends on your taste. The biggest strength of Hunter x Hunter is that even if some episodes tend to drag, along with some arcs, the characters keep everything alive and engaging. More on that later.
The art was phenomenal. It was neat, clean, brightly colored and nice to look at. I say this often, but it honestly was a pleasure to watch. The animation itself was also very pretty, especially the last episode with those gorgeous natural backgrounds. 
The sound was pretty neat. The voice actors (both English and Japanese) did a great job, putting a lot of emotion into their characters. They all felt very real. The opening theme was always the same, but it was changed to fit every arc, and it was done very well as well. The closing themes changed over the course of the anime, but they always fit the arc and served as a good way to end it. My only problem with the sound was for the next episode preview. Sometimes, it had rather 'circus' music that messed with the soft feels the episode itself gave. The background music was also very fitting and quiet. 
I loved the characters to death. Even as much as I hated myself for it, I couldn't bring myself to truly dislike a single person. Even the villains had their redeeming qualities while every hero had their low points. Nobody was black or white, everyone was in the gray area and everyone had the potential to change. Not a lot of series or writers can master this balance, but they managed it and it was beautiful. I loved Leorio and Kurapika, so I was a little sad they were AWOL for so long, but it was pretty sweet when Leorio made his appearance again. 
I enjoyed this more than I expected I would. It was fun, engaging, and it made me laugh, cry, and learn a lot. Perhaps we're not all perfect, and perhaps we're not all heroes. And maybe we don't always get what we want. But as our old man Ging says, ""You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want."" In the end, this is what the show boils down to, and I can vouch that I enjoyed those detours to the fullest. 
In the end, I loved it to death and it hurts that there's no more. (I'm still praying for another season of this... and Ouran season two pleasseeee)
I would recommend this if you: like shonen, like FullMetal Alchemist/ long drawn out adventures for an ultimate goal, fighting anime, like kid main characters, like lowkey bromance, like questions about morality and death and worthiness and willpower, think about what makes people human a lot, like long series, like character development, can handle blood/gore, can handle death
I would NOT recommend this if you: can't handle blood/death/gore, prefer short series, need a lot of comedy and romance, don't like long, drawn-out sagas, not into fighting, prefer shoujo
Have a great day everyone!",9
"
                Such a disappointment coming from Yu Yu Hakusho and hearing so many great things about this anime. I'd been hesitant to start it because of the animation style and the main cast but eventually caved to a couple of suggestions from friends and the accessibility of it on Netflix.
Turns out it's a real feast of bad writing:
-Almost exclusively one-dimensional characters that lose their flair within minutes of being onscreen.
-Abhorrently slow pacing especially prevalent in later arcs.
-Lackluster storytelling and abscence of discernable character motive even in arc climaxes outside of ""get stronger, get stronger""
-Loses sight of creating interesting abilities, instead placing 'quirky' limitations on them to
                  plug potential holes in scenarios where they otherwise could have been used.
If you're insistent on giving it a try, I'd recommend dropping after finishing the Phantom Troupe arc if you care about your time or the Greed Island arc if you're a gacha game enthusiast.
But there's a nice respite after every episode with catchy ending themes and a sigh of relief that it's over.",2

                Hunter X hunter.  First I would like to start by saying everyone that hasn't seen this anime, GOO WATCH IT, at first when I saw this anime I thought that it looked horrible because of the art and just not many people said it was good to me, however once I watched this anime I wanted to watch it again and again and im so sad the this anime is going to end, NOOOOOOO.HISOKA IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am up to episode 57 and so far I can say with ease that Hisoka is the best character in this anime in my opinion I just
                  cant get enough of him, and his battles. MAN HISOKA FTW",8
"
                Again after the One Piece anime i have to be the bad guy, dissing on an anime that not only is revered by most of the anime community (as it is evident by its position on MAL) but that i actually would have very much enjoyed, story wise, if it wasn't for being a TERRIBLE adaptation. But if the not-so-good quality of the One Piece anime is not really controversial on the other hand i realize this is considered by most people a good adaptation, by someone even better than the original manga (ugh) so i'll need to explain.
I'm not gonna concentrate much on world-building
                  and plot since the anime is mostly a 1:1 adaptation on that aspect, so if i do i will when i got time to review the manga, here i'm just gonna talk about the aspect that made this a very bad adaptation that completely betrays Togashi artistic vision. Let's start with Togashi art, shall we? Now, despite popular belief, Togashi is a brilliant artist, while the influence of Toriyama was easily recognizible both in Yu Yu Hakusho (i think that's why a lot of people believe ""He drew better back then"", because he used the style they're more accustomed to) and early HxH he then started to develop a more personal style, in a way going in the opposite direction of what Toriyama canonized as the new standard manga-style, surpassing Tezuka in iconicity. Said style had as the golden rule the idea that the trait should be extremely clean and simple, any scene, especially the fight scene, no matter the inherent chaos of the moment, should be easily readable in a very short time-span by kids of all ages. You can easily realize this by comparing Toriyama art with artists contemporary to him like Hara or predecessors like Nagai to get what this meant, and surely that was one of the aspect that made Dragon Ball one of the most important manga in history. Later authors, while ususally partially abandoning the over-simplicity, mantained this ideal and created their new style from this common denominator. Togashi, from a certain point onward, decided this wasn't for him. His story wasn't a feel good story, his world was rotten, his characters disturbed, aseptic or overwhelmed by emotions, there was no reason for the trait not to retrace this atmosphere. Because of that he developed a very peculiar art-style, swingling between minimalism and over-detailed scenes, and most importantly predilecting over anything (and especially pleasentness to the eyes, an aspect he really didn't care about, very legimitely) the conveyance of the atmosphere and characters emotions, making it genuinely disturbing when the scene needed so. The anime from '99, with all its deficiencies (filler and some minor censors, i just ignore Greed Island OVAs, they don't exist) did capture this aspect, the artistic quality varied episode by episode, with some very underwhelming and some that, unlike the stuff that people new to the media believe is ""great animation"" (usually confusing it with ""art-style"", and btw dear MAL, you're doing it too) these days, were actually top notch works of art. Anyway, even when the quality wasn't on top, they really tried their best to respect Togashi's vision. Then the 2011 adaptation came from Madhouse, and for the joy of pre-teen kids from all around the world the nerfed, family-friendly version of Hunter x Hunter was produced. Jokes aside, i'm really astonished that a company that just the year before worked with Yuasa to a masterpiece like Tatami no Galaxy, that was not only well-made technically but obviously had a great artistic vision, was able just one year later to produce such a bad and plain anime, nonetheless from a manga like HxH, that is easily the best Shonen Jump manga of the last 30 years (yes, it took a while to start to actually talk about the reviewed anime, sorry, but the introduction was needed to be clearer). Or better, i was astonished, then i realized when i've seen people reaction for it. Hunter x Hunter 2011 is the Marvel Cinematic Universe of anime, a product that is well-manifactued from a purely technical point of view and bet everything on just being pleasant for the average viewer, fullfilling the minimum common denominator but actively eliminating any kind of profoundity, graphical experimentation etc from the original work and in general from what the medium can do, making it an extremely bland commercial product. All the colours are screwed, the darkness of the manga leave place to the most brightest colours possible, everything is roundish and patinated, there is no space for experimentation or risk, if they did it would have been possible (at least that's what i'm guessing went on on the director's head) that newcomers of the media wouldn't understood it and cricized it like they do with Togashi's own art-style, therefore the anime would have been slightly less successfull and god forbid us from making a bit less money, who cares about the artistic vision when you have to sell an anime to tv networks afterall?
All the expressions, especially Hisoka's, Killua's (they kept the cute faces but eliminated the crazy serial killer eyes basically), Gon's ""full-black eyes"" mode were screwed, except a couple times (out of god-knows-how-much) with Hisoka there isn't literally a single one of those that were saved (especially Gon is the one whose characterization suffered the most from this, but early Killua too)
Also, a lot of people love to say this, unlike the '99 version, follow the manga closely. Well, this is blatantly false for anyone reading/watching it in a way that is even slighly less superficial than ""x happens"". Yes, the story is the same (like in the old anime) and there's a bit less filler scenes (but immensely worst and more childish than in the '99 version) and just one almsot entirely filler episode, but the level of censorship this anime gets in the first half almost gave me late 90s/early 2000s foreign adaptations vibes and that, well, sucked. The anime was then moved to another time slot and the second half is a bit better censor-wise, but all the other problems remained and possibly become even more evident, since Chimera Ants arc is for example the arc Togashi really went all in with his disturbing dark style, where the anime (while obviously couldn't mantain the same brightness of the early parts since that would have been evidently ridicolous) kept nerfing and normalizing it, especially in the ""Gon rage"" (i managed to not spoil until now and i will not do that here, don't worry) scenes that had 1/100 of the power they had on paper with Togashi's expressful style.
Unlike in the One Piece review, where i was able to find at least a couple scenes that were better made in the anime than in the manga (even tho that was just because of the different media that allowed anime producers to implement the music parts) there is basically nothing i would save from this anime except obviously the story and partially the characters (that anyway were still worse characterized than in the manga, since their visual representation and behavior counts too, not just what they say), so basically the aspects anime producers had 0 to do with. I have no doubt that someone watching this anime while having 0 idea about the original work, or as said people that really cannot appreciate the artistic vision of it (probably because of age and the style they're accustomed to) will find this anime very good (hopefully not ""#7 place"" good tho), still if a single person reading this review will decide, despite the vast majority opinion, to give the manga a chance instead of this terrible reduction i'll consider these 20-something minutes i used to wrote this and the i-don't-want-to-remember-how-much-goddamn-hours i spent watching this show (hoping in a develoopment, because people told me so, that ""trust me from the Chimera Ants the art-style becomes incredible"", well it didn't) not completely wasted.",4

                In a world where the shonen genre is full of cliche tropes and bland characters, HxH brings us hope and promise. Our protagonist, Gon, is a happy go lucky kid on the adventure to become a Hunter. As we accompany him through his journey, we meet the friends he makes and experience his many unique adventures.
This show is the gold standard for shonen, no, anime in general. The execution of complex themes as the show progresses is remarkable. Never have I seen a show that can create characters you could sympathize with and root for in a matter of a few episodes. These characters are
                  also realistic, in that they don't cling to the ideals typical shonen characters embrace; this leads for a more interesting story, as you don't get the cliche ""beat the boss with friendship"" or ""save him because he's my friend"" story lines. Instead, you see characters change, get angry and become anti-heroes; you can't blame them for the path they start to walk down, but you also see how this isn't a show about being a hero, but about being a person. 
Every arc has something unique to offer, although I will say the show picks up in the Yorknew Arc. The animation and fights are terrific, and you will not be disappointed. The series is long, but does not suffer from the filler dilemma like Naruto. The only downside to this show is the fact that it hasn't finished, but it ends on a pretty good note that provides some sort of closure.
If you haven't seen this series, I highly recommend it. I've rewatched it 5 times and find new things to notice and think about each time. I've recommend this show to 10 people and they've all given it a 10/10 and rated it their best show period. I honestly find it hard to watch most anime after watching HxH, since none come close.",10

                The King of the shounen anime, but it might not be your cup of tea.
Hunter X Hunter is heavy on exposition. By this I mean they will give you a lot of heavy context. Entire episode can go in explaining small details. This helps you understand the fundamental rules. It's like a chess, understanding the rules is really boring, but when the game begins it is one of the most brilliant things out there.
But do you know what is the problem with chess? It is not everyone's cup of tea, rules can be tough to understand and it takes a lot of time and patience
                  to master the game. We live in the age of instant gratification, where things like, Fortnite, Call of Duty and My hero academia dominates.
Most shounen anime has this type of story.
The protagonist has sad background story, he is also useless and trash but somehow he has something, which makes him special. He is the pillar of righteousness, who can convert non-believer into believer. As the story progresses, he will get a random power up, which is definitely overpowered ability, but the trash protagonist doesn't know how to use it. With his hard work the protagonist will make That Power his own, but sooner or later he will get more powers at the top of that overpowered ability he already has. Then our protagonist will go and Beat some bad guys, who are bad because of their twisted sense of Justice. In the end, with the help of the power of friendship he will become the greatest number 1.
If you want anime which represent your boring and lackluster life, where good for nothing protagonist overcomes all the odds despite being a trash. Anime which make you feel motivated that you can also be something great. Then this is not your type show.
Hunter x hunter is not your typical shounen anime. Aftertaste of this anime will not leave a good taste in your mouth. People who suck in this universe, are usually the one who died first. It is like the representation of real life, no Candy coating, no talk no jutsu, no asspulls.",10

                Here we have a show where anything and everything is possible. HxH is the absolute true definition of don't judge a book by it's cover. Seriously. It's like cliche shonen, gone wrong. ""Childhood ruined"" works too. Gon, the main character to an extent, is just some average corny kid that you could literally pull out of any childhood anime show like Beyblade or Sonic X. But that is it. Gon is about the ONLY 'childlike' 'G-rated' thing about this show. Oh yes Hunter x Hunter is awesome and entertaining but also DARK, DEEP and CRAZY people! Rated M and above. The plots, the humor, characters,
                  the fights, the emotion, the philosophies and psychology, ALL Mature or above. I can go on, but point is, this show is heavy and should be treated as such. 
The craziest part about it all is, it was all done right! Hunter x Hunter executed this so flawlessly. While I was watching, my excitement grew as the story progressed, because I already know I was in for a ride because the format and layout of the show is extremely unique and special to this show. In addition, it was nearly impossible to predict what would happen next. 
Hunter x Hunter is the real deal people. You won't expect to choke up (or cry for the crybabies) but Oh, you will. You will grow to love everyone that you encounter in this show. Minor characters included. Antagonists included. Some the rawest most genuine emotion I've ever seen in an anime comes from this show. Some of the best fights ever also come from this show. Some of the funnies—you see where I'm going? This show overly excels in all areas. Entertainment at it's finest. 
This is a remake of the original 1999 version of this show. The selected tone of the vintage HxH is overall more dark and grim but also awesome none the less. It's was only 62 episodes and it really highlights the unexpected grim and grit to the seemingly childish show. The art and animation pleasingly more detailed and while the fights were good in there own the right, the fight sequences don't hold a candle to the new ones. Considering it's length and the older animation, it just wasn't as ""free"" and imaginative as the new.
Moving forward with the new Hunter x Hunter, I don't have any legitimate grips other than it being really slow in the very beginning. No big deal though because you're eventually hit in the face with a hint of the madness to come. People (and me) get a real kick out of recommending this show because it's funny how real things get despite the kiddy looks. It was a real pleasure to watch this masterpiece. What a ride.
(This was a review based on the Sub)",10

                This anime is like perfection itself to me personally. Every character is so detailed, vivid, compelling, quirky, lively, and I can even recall very minor characters (cried during the match with Killua's girl butler and when the Octopus changed sides) which I can't say how rare it is to find in anime. 
Music, sound and voice acting is great. Sometimes the music doesn't quite capture what the scene is trying to do, but it's passable. Art is solid. The world mirrors our own quite closely, but it works since it makes the characters a lot more relatable than typical full-fantasy settings. 
Story begins as a
                  very typical if well-panned and thought-out shonen work, so to be honest, this would not have received a 10/10 from me if not for the Chimera ant arc. The build-up, the battles, the villains, the down-spiralling of the looming dooming situation and the unexpected twist at the end was absolutely AMAZING, like I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU PULLED THAT OFF ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME LEVEL of amazing. The Yorkshin Arc and Chimera ant arc transformed the typical shounen story so far into a work that dealt with complex and mature themes that are virtually unseen in previous shounen works. No one is ""fully evil"". All the villains are given sympathetic aspects of character that you can't help but admire them as much as the protagonists despite their evil deeds (afaik, Phantom members have quite amount of fans and you'll see why). 
The characters are riveting and combine that with strategized battles -- it's not just brute force that wins the rounds, but observance, analysis, and creative use of your powers can help you overcome the most seemingly unbeatable enemy -- and this will literally get you so excited and you won't be able to stop watching just to see what happens next. The Aura-system impacted Shounen manga in uncountable ways and presents unlimited possibilities of powers. 
Another big plus is -- and I notice not many say this -- it's so refreshing that female characters are not heavily sexualized. Ok, so the main cast is mostly male, but there are major female characters as well, and you don't remember female characters for their sex appeal or how big their boobs/butts are, or for their sexual catering to the male leads to fulfill some sort of sexual fantasy, or even get naked at some point (even Rumiko Takahashi does this, y'know). You remember them for their personalities. For their passions. For the way they handle problems thrown at them. For their quirks. A certain blonde pink-dressed lady reads adult male magazines while training Gon and Killua. In fact, this series has one of the most adorable female character who is bald, short, fat, buck-tooth'd and you can't even tell she was female until you know her. But she is a badass in her own right and also sweet thing as a human being, and I can't say not only many shounen anime, but even movies or anything that caters to the masses that would dare to feature a deformed woman stripped of all sexual recognition. To this, I can only applaud Togashi. I can't help but feel that it works because he sees the world with a sort of childish innocence that is far beyond the perceptive capacities of the orthodox adult (would a childish person be able to write something like Yorkshin or Chimera ant?) that makes his world both simpler and more true to the essence of human lives at the same time.
Truly, it's anime like this that makes you proud to be an Otaku.",10
"
                There are so many great reviews on this site already, nothing I can write will do justice. I do want to state that HxH becomes awesome after the first handful of episodes, and doesn't let up through to the final episode. 
After watching Naruto I was really pleased to see the lack of 'filler' episodes with HxH; that every episode progressed the main story arc.
If you have 70+ hours in the coming months and want to witness a masterpiece of storytelling and animation, check out the 2011 version of HxH. Don't take my word for it alone; look at the rest of the reviews on
                  this site.
Now when will Togashi finish the next arc and get it animated?",10
"
                I am apprehensive in writing this review, for I am going against the crowd by not giving it an immediate 10/10 here, and HxH elitists might kill me for it, but please hear me out.
Story: 7/10.
Hunter x Hunter is definitely the superior shounen OF ITS TIME. It is hard to define ""shounen,"" since it is not exactly a genre. Most people conjure action-packed series with clearly defined arcs that are loosely connected with each other upon hearing ""shounen,"" so I will stick with this definition. There is no comparison between HxH and its contemporaries, such as Naruto and Bleach in terms of writing. It is
                  creative and unpredictable with complex character writing and profound philosophy woven in, and brings a breath of fresh air to the shounen genre. 
However, Togashi's writing is not flawless, contrary to many HxH die-hard fans believe. The story, which is actually not very original if you think about it, doesn't go from good to great until Yorknew Arc, which I think most HxH fans can agree with. For shounen fans, it is fine, since they are in it for the action, but for someone who is more interested in the plot like me, HxH almost lost me at Heaven Arena arc. There are still a lot of plot conveniences which are typically found in shounens. The two protagonists, Killua and Gon, are way too lucky on their adventure. They always meet the right people at the right time who take interest in them out of nowhere. SPOILERS ALERT
 There are seemingly asspulling resurrections, too. When Gon is critically injured, Killua suddenly remembers that he has a little sister named Alluka whom he completely forgets about up until now locked up in the basement at home and who possesses God-like power that can grant any wish, albeit with repercussions based on the law of equivalent exchange. However, Killua can make any wish without any consequences at all. Although the lack of consequences for Killua is nicely explained and becomes integral to Killua's character development, even if it is quite a convenience, the former is not. Alluka's existence was hinted at from the start, but her powers remained completely unknown. Her absurdly vast powers are revealed so late that a viewer cannot help but feel she is just a plot device to resurrect our beloved protagonist. It also becomes a plot hole of sorts, for why didn't Killua make a wish and wipe out all the villains to save the world in the preceding arc? 
SPOILERS END
The Chimera Ant arc is hailed as the greatest arc of the series, and also the greatest shounen arc of all time, but I was utterly underwhelmed. The pacing was incredibly slow. I couldn't help skipping forward because I was tired of characters screaming ""OUUU"" and crying for episodes and episodes. 
Art 8/10: There's nothing really special about the visuals, but the animation is great
Sound: 9/10 Awesome soundtrack
Character: 8/10. Definitely HxH's strongest point. All of the characters are fleshed out nicely and have good character development. Even the villains are complex and fascinating, notably fan-favorite Hisoka the psychopathic pedophilic clown and Mereum the powerful grotesque ant.
Enjoyment: 7/10. As I said before, I wasn't invested in the series until Yorknew Arc. This is purely subjective. I tried to be as objective as I could about other points, though.
Overall: 7/10. Solid anime.",7
"
I had always been curious why Hunter x Hunter was always top on recommended shounen lists. And now I know why because it has climbed on top of my own list as well
Hunter x Hunter is an amazing anime. I’m so glad I decided to watch it because this show has left me with unforgettable memories. And I’m low-key sad it ended because it’s gonna take me few days to get over it.
 I just love Gon and Killua’s relationship from the bottom of my heart.
Killua....I just have no words for him. 
And hisoka gave me some -_- moments but can’t bring myself to hate
                  him lmaooo. He’s quite interesting indeed. 
And all the characters are awesome including the villains. The character developments are just too good. 
The show had so many moral dilemmas which had me seriously thinking until the end.
It’s not just about the heroes fighting the villains and emerging victorious. 
HxH got me thinking if the heroes are really good and villains really bad. I’ve questioned this before in Naruto and now I was questioning myself again. And maybe it’s just me haha.
I’m aware about Mangaka’s health issues and manga being on indefinite hiatus so I was really worried how I would wait after the anime was over. And I’m sure many of you might have that question in mind too and maybe not starting the series for that very reason (that was one of my reason too for not watching it till now, a lame excuse right?) 
But worry not because right now I’m just so satisfied with everything. Ofcourse not all my questions were answered and there were fights and maybe arcs I was waiting for to happen but that’s okay. Atleast it didn’t end at a cliffhanger or something so I couldn’t have asked for more :)
As for shortcomings....Yes there were and other reviews might have in-depth details for the same but I rate and review purely based on my experience and enjoyment rather than critically analysing each and everything so yeah 10/10 for everything.",10
"
                I would, without a doubt in my mind, name hunter x hunter the pinnacle of the adventure genre. It was a long but outstanding watch that I would re-experience in a heartbeat and recommend to anyone looking to go on a journey.
STORY: 10/10
Split into perfect length arcs and ending on a note that feels like the conclusion, even though the manga is still ongoing :(, this story is one of a kind. Beginning on a tiny island in the middle of nowhere, our enigmatic protagonist goes out of his comfort zone alone in order to explore the world and find his elusive father. Every arc
                  gets darker, more interesting and delves deeper into the world building, story, politics and characters. The seamless connections between arcs is something I've never seen any other anime live up to and the escalation of power from arc to arc just gets you more excited for what's to come. The Chimera Ant Arc is either deemed the worst part of the serious, taking up about 60 of the episodes, or a masterpiece within a masterpiece. I would contend that by itself, it is indeed just a slowly paced and lengthy story, but as an aspect of the rest of the show is where the arc shines. The character arcs of Gon and Killua come to fantastic tensions within the arc, and watching their characters grow to fruition afterwards filled me with joy. And besides that, the overall plot of the arc introduced the audience to some of the large-scale politics within this world. It brings into perspective how big the world we're watching really is, which is something that I think hunter x hunter coined for adventure, personally. True adventure is feeling as though you will never stop discovering new parts of the world to explore, which hxh proves to us in ever arc with increasing creativity. I honestly feel like I can't encapsulate my thoughts on the story within one simple review, because there's just too much to talk about. The only way to really understand the experience is to watch it yourself.
Art: 10/10
It might not be my favourite art ever, but not only is the general style just so easy and pleasing on the eyes, certain scenes just grip you with the tension from the art on the screen, so it would be wrong of me to give it anything other than a 10.
SOUND: 10/10 
I'm not really an expert of sound, it's definitely more of background noise than something I actively take notice towards, but I can certainly recognise some of the soundtrack outside of watching the show. In moments of tension and angst, it does a fantastic job of reflecting that on the audience through the sound, likewise in happy and lighthearted scenes too. Hisoka's theme is also quite memorable and always makes me cringe whenever I hear due to the association with the character, which I think is a job well done, especially since it encapsulates his chaotic nature so well. But my favourite aspect of the sound is the opening theme. I have never skipped 'depature' in 148 epsides of watching; not once. It never gets old. Also, the endings were very well done as well and I always made time to listen to the one in the Chimera Ant Arc.
CHARACTER: 10/10
I know that this part of the overall story is focused on Gon and Killua since the manga is now focused on Kurapika and Leorio more, but oh my lord. The character arcs of these two. There are out of this world. What began as a simple fun and pure friendship where these two adolescent boys cared for each other slowly transformed, throughout the series, into a brotherhood that each of them would kill to protect. But it isn't even as simple as that. 
[SPOILERS] 
It became clear in the beginning of chimera ant arc that Gon and Killua had different priorites, and it was heartbreaking to see Killua do everything in his power to keep Gon alive and safe while Gon was fighting relentlessly for the sake of revenge. It felt like the entire arc was Killua on 'Gon damage control', which came to a climax when Gon went insane with vengence and forced Killua to watch as he destroyed himself in front of him. And even after that Killua still sacrificed everything to get Gon back in one piece. All throughout the arc we never see this devotion reciprocated and although it hurts to see them part at the end, we know that Killua needed time to take care of himself after all the trauma he went through for his friend, and to be with someone who cares as much to him as they do about him. It was sad but it was necessary and I loved the way that Killua came into himself by the end. Even Gon going through the trauma of losing a friend because he left him and losing himself to that despair; he went from being an innocent kid who didn't want to hurt anyone, to someone who destroyed himself for revenge. And after all that, we see him come to terms with the fact that he can't save everyone even if he somehow succeeded this time.
[SPOILERS OVER SORRY JUST NEEDED TO SAY THAT]
Aside from those two perfect characters, Kurapika and, towards the end mostly, Leorio were also done quite well, especially the eeriness of Kurapika's unrelenting grief. The villians, I suppose Hisoka encapsulates them, are exquisite. Every villain feels like a human being and in every fight scene you are allowed to sympathise with them, and it's fantastic to be a part of. The side characters have unusual depth and although I'm not overly passionate about them, their death's have genuine impact. Overall, the characters are very well done.
ENJOYMENT: 10/10
I had an absolute rollercoaster of emotions throughout this and I can confidently say this was one of the most intriguing and entertaining series I've ever watched, without a doubt. The angst, the tension, the humour, the joy, the tears and laughter: hunter x hunter has it all and I am 100% here for it all.
OVERALL: 10/10
Just watch it. I know it's long but it's worth it. Anyone who rates this less than a 10 is just salty about the length. It's the epitome of adventure and the greatest world I've ever witnessed come to life. Please just watch it.",10
"
                hunter x hunter was a solid 10 through the conclusion of the Yorknew City arc. The Phantom Trope were such an exciting villain to the story, and the wildcard Hisoka was brilliant from the very beginning. This was the peak of the show.
Then came the Greed Island arc. It was good, but sadly not on the same level as the past story had been. Bisky and the dodgeball match practically save that season from being average.
And then we had the Chimera Ants... possibly the worst executed thing I have seen since Game of Thrones season 8. It blows my mind how anyone can label this
                  arc as good. First off, 60 episodes is a joke. Stretching one plot over almost half of the show led to the obvious mistake of awful pacing and boring development. Focusing on the Queen Ant and her Officers for the first 25 episodes, then just throwing them away, was the biggest waste of time ever.
However, the biggest flaw of this arc is with the characters. Gon's character was absolutely ruined in this. I can just list off things he did that made 0 sense and didnt follow his character traits from the previous 70+ episodes. Being willing to kill an innocent girl? Taking hostages? Like what? But the biggest shit show with Gon out of everything is his interaction with Kite. A man he barely knew, and had almost no connection to, was his driving force the entire arc. Gon was willing to lose everything, including his father and his life, to avenge some dude he knew for a couple days...laughable. Remove Gon from the arc and its a decent storyline.
Meruem and Komugi obviously amazing, best thing by far to come out of the Chimera Ant crap show. Neferpitou's character was wasted and the writer figuratively spit on us by showing glimpses of redemption from her just to make her some bland predator who blindly follows the King
Fun show, decent show only however. Maybe if the show hadn't abruptly ended then the Chimera Ant arc wouldnt pull the show down so much... but sadly its all we got. Without a conclusion anywhere in the near future all we can do is reflect on how much potential this show had and subsequently threw away.
Oh and whos idea was it to not have Kurapika in the last 80 episodes? And to only have the Phantom Trope in like 5 of those 80 episodes? Cmon man!",7

                I started watching Hunter × Hunter by the end of March, and 2 months later it's finally over.
Now, to be honest, Hunter × Hunter's pacing is quite slow, particularly in the Hunter Exam & Chimera Ant Arcs, however, the plot uses a ton of creative ideas to keep things fresh and enjoyable constantly, which is impressive, and the story gets much more interesting and mature in the process, and the pay-offs are some of the best I've seen in an Anime.
The characters are awesome; they're very engaging and ""colorful"", particularly the main characters and especially the villains; Hunter × Hunter has undoubtedly some of my
                  favorite villains I've ever seen! I was genuinely impressed by characters like Hisoka and Meruem, 2 of my favorite characters in the whole series.
Also, the music and the animation are great.
Unfortunately, despite having a sense of closure and a fantastic ending, the story is not entirely finished yet and it's probably never going to be finished; it's been 8 years since the series stopped releasing episodes.
That's probably my only ""major"" complaint about the series.
Pros:
+ Intriguing story
+ Wide variety of different ideas for each arc
+ Compelling and likable characters
+ Charming music
+ Beautiful animation
Cons:
- Slow pacing
- Unfinished bigger narrative
Narrative: 8/10
Characters: 10/10
Music: 8/10
Final Rating: 10/10
- Masterpiece -
Hunter × Hunter is an extremely well-rounded, entertaining and masterfully made series even if it's somewhat unfinished; it's an absolutely wonderful adventure filled with surprises.
Put simply, Hunter × Hunter is a Shonen masterpiece and one of the better Anime series I've watched so far.
Do I recommend it?:
Definitely yes! Unless 148 full episodes is too much for you.",10

                Hunter x Hunter is a masterpiece. I don't care what you say, it is still a master piece because it is. Those who gave it a one because it's oh-so-typical have no taste. At first, I read the manga, the story concept was interesting and I thought there would only be the becoming Hunter part to Gon's story. However, I found out there was an anime for it. So I went to the old one instead of this one. I watched up till the tenth episode and could not find anymore. Then I stumbled upon this. I noticed the huge improvement in the art style
                  and characters and I loved it. Here's why you SHOULD watch Hunter x Hunter.
Story: Although at first glance, you would be like, isn't this a children's show? But no. Just because a kids on the cover doesn't mean it doesn't cover mature topics. This is a story of adventure and your attention won't drop once you go through the introductory part of the anime. One of the things I love about this anime is how diverse the arcs are. You won't expect the arcs to be different, but they are, and that's why its lovely. This is why it is NOT mediocre in adventure. Most of all, even though the arcs are different, you still follow through with the story. It simply connects. Just like another reviewer said this is one of the best story writing of anime. Here's how the story goes: Gon the main character is a young boy looking to find his father and also aspires to be a hunter. The story does not entirely focus on one thing, it adds up to Gon's Goal. As you watch through the episodes, you will find the relationships between the characters to be very heartwarming as well that the story goes very in depth with the other characters stories. AND they are not boring, I find other anime's character stories to be dull and predictable, but hunter x hunter is not, it is unexpected. The story is a roller coaster of humor, joy, sadness, and excitement.
Art: The art is better than the original, I believe we can all see that. I love how the characters appearances looks better than before and the colors are more vibrant. The animations are fast and the fight scenes are exciting to watch. 
Sound: The opening is awesome, there are some different openings for each arc. The production is very dedicated to making the sound be enjoyed to the utmost. The characters voices are very pleasing and match up to their image. I don't think any of their voices were annoying. 
Character: As I said before, character development is a huge part of this anime. Gon and Killua's friendship will make you wish you had their friendship! As well as Kurapika and Leonardo. Other characters will also make you sympathize with them even if they are a villain. They all have a story to tell, and you will want to hear it. 
Enjoyment: 10/10 I very much enjoyed this!! It is one of my most favorite animes and will always be. It made me cry, laugh and feel for the characters. This is what an anime should do. 
Overall: I strongly recommend people to watch this and continue if it has been dropped, because there is so much more to it and watching the 140+ episodes was worth the while. I truly hope that there will be another season of this extraordinary piece.",10

                I normally don't write reviews but I felt like this anime deserved one. I haven't watched the older version of this anime for reference, I never even gave this anime a chance until a week ago. It took me a whole week and thats how interested I was in the show. Unlike popular long episode animes, this was one that didn't have any unnecessary scenes or fillers. It has a good balance of comedy, action and thriller, and made me feel alot of emotions towards the last two arcs. The two things that took me by suprise is the fighting animations and the character development.
                  The animation was so smooth and breath taking i couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Secondly, the character developments were amazing, especially with the villians. You get to see all different kinds of perspective and small details that are important, which shows how much the creaters put so much effort into everything. I definetly hope that in the future they continue to make a season 2 and keep up with the hard work and effort. 
Summary : definetely a show that no one should underestimate by the cover picture and synopsis (something I judge by sometimes unfortunately) , the show is worth a lot more and is one of those animes that will always have a speacial place.",10
"
                People are full of shit it seems, I can summarise this anime in two words - Plot Convenience
The ENTIRE anime is run on plot convenience, if you enjoy this show you probably know nothing about story writing (Im not exactly an expert myself) and so you dont see how awful this anime is. Ill get back to all that tho.
Three things that make a good series; 
1) CHARACTERS - hxh has no fully established characters, most are disregarded like the ice cubes you kick under the couch [except even the ice cubes melt and have more impact than hxh characters] 
2) PLOT - ridiculous plot
                  as far as the anime goes - about a boy who wants to become a hunter so he can find his dad which is thrown back in your face because you never learn what a hunter really is and his dad is a useless knobhead. If you get threw all episodes and still have the patience to see what nonsense they have to offer then you are a special breed 
3) Theme - The theme is the only thing it really gets points for I guess. Its not the best theme in the world and has a lot of inconsistencies but if the characters and plot were good it might be decent - They aint tho so its trash
I can guarantee you that most people who tell you this anime is good have either watched it when they were younger and so it holds sentimental value or they just love Killua, thats all it is. Poor kid has carry the zoldyck family and the REST OF THE FUCKING ANIME it seems. I mean he is somewhat a likeable character but then again he is one of the few characters who actually show up for more than 3 episodes in the anime. Even then his personality changes like every two seconds and his character arcs last about 3 mins at best. But lets not focus on the good points of the anime and focus on the bad ones because there is plenty of that.
Back to plot convenience, the entire anime runs off plot convenience, the characters never actually have to work hard or solve anything out for themselves (the exception being that one prison part of the hunter exam). There's always CONVENIENTLY a character who helps them move on to the next stage of the show and then never again shows up in the anime. Skip the next paragraph if you dont want spoilers that list plot convenience.
[[[ SPOILERS: list of plot convenience ( pretty much the entire thing);
- old sailor who knows how to sail through terrible storms to get to island...YAYY 
- tells them to go to tree which leads them to characters that just take them to the place... no need to have the skills to find it .. just introduce tour guides and then never mention them again...YAYY
- Kurapika doesnt need to work hard - just make a pact and gain infinite power ... and then go on a FUCKING SIDE QUEST to collect eyeballs for the rest of the show...YAYY
- someone ""out of the kindness of their hearts"" teaches Gon and Killua about Nen...YAYY
- bump into zepile who makes them a lot of money and sell your hunter card which is worth a lot [even tho no one knows what the fuck a hunter is] to get enough money for the next arc...YAYY
- Cant afford it but an old man who has alot of consoles lets them use it....YAYY (which is nonsense btw.. what was that melodramatic nonsense about not being able to keep what you took from the game as part of the contract, only for them to not bother about it in the end. Gon didnt know the old man gave up and let them keep everything which is awfully fucking convenient)
- Dont know what greed island is and spend all your time training but bump into some people an lose everything which leads you to gain a card that you can monopolise and get every other card with barely any effort... YAYY
- Bump into another master of nen who is willing to train gon an killua...YAYY
- The number 2 card is missing? if only there is a way to get information about it without actually haven't to work hard, oh wait theres a card for that... YAYY
- You need 15 members to get card no.2 and the bomber doesnt have 15 people..YAYY
- You cant take non-number cards out of greed island but there is an item that allows you to hack the system...YAYY
- You are weak and need a power upgrade - just pull a pin out of your head...YAYY
- Killua has super saiyan?? killua has drained all his power, whatever can we do?? I KNOW LETS GO TO A POWER PLUG A CHARGE HIM LIKE AN IPHONEEEE ....YAYY
- You have a ridiculously over powered character and cant do anything about him? introduce a nuke which completely UNDERMINES THE ENTIRE FUCKING NEN SYSTEM .....thats just fucking lazy
Theres alot more but cant be assed - you get the point gon hasnt had to work hard for a single thing in the entire anime aside from physical training which is pretty sad considering the fights are lack luster at best]]]]]
The show is badddd, like next level. The power system is non existent. The ant arc, the last big arc, is not only incredibly boring but its anticlimactic which is surprising really, I had absolutely no expectation for the ending and they somehow still found a way to disappoint. The events in the anime constantly undermine the previous events.
No character is worth investing in because they're all bland, barely have any depth to them ( theres a character called razor and his shoes receive more screen time than half the characters on the show ... HIS SHOESSS lmfaoooo) or the characters just do a 180 and become different people... 
If you want to watch the thing because you wanted to know about Gon and his story and if you heard about his ""super saiyan"" form like I did before the anime and wanted to explore it just know that its not worth it. Watch it on youtube its probably like 2 mins long and brings a new definition to pathetic. 
Just save yourself the trouble and dont watch it.

                This is my favourtie anime of all time, and since watching it I have yet to find another anime able to create a range of characters as interesting as those in Hunter x Hunter.
STORY - 9 
I was constantly interested in the story and what was to come next throughout every arc of this anime. Even in the weaker arcs, I was compelled by the overarching goals of each characters as well as the constant build ups to important events. Despite some pacing issues in latter arcs, I never felt burnt out watching this even though I was watching it pretty much non stop whenever
                  I could. Simple story overall, but with many complex and intricate subplots which were fantastically written. The main reason why this section wasn't a 10/10 was because of the fact that it is incomplete in some areas due to the manga being unfinished, leaving me wanting more.
ART - 8
Can't complain about the art and animation in this series. There were no instances where I thought the art was uninspired or boring and when necessary, the animation was very impressive. The character designs are iconic and memorable, and the settings are all great.
SOUND - 9
Great OST with numerous brilliant tracks which help create brilliant atmosphere and ambience when needed. The OST helps significantly with the frequent shifts in tone which occur in this anime, and in my opinion they always worked perfectly with the mood on screen. A great OP which was very hard to not sing along to and some good EDs as well. Some of the character themes were great, I particulalry loved Hisoka's theme.
CHARACTER - 10
I think the characters were the best part of this anime, with a great main cast and (arguably) even better supporting characters. I liked Gon; he was a simple character but was certainly not one-dimensional and perfect as some protagonists are. Killua was brilliantly written and his friendship with Gon is iconic and the series couldn't be nearly as good without him. The antagonists in this show were my favourite characters, and I'm yet to have found other shows with a similarly broad cast of great antagonists. Hisoka is, in my opinion, one of the best supporting characters in any anime - whenever he was on screen the show improved drastically and I would love to see more from him. Without any spoilers, the other groups of villains all exceeded my expectations, and include some of the best morally grey characters I've seen in television.
ENJOYMENT - 9
Pretty obvious based off everything I said that I loved this anime, the only reason this isn't a 10 is because of the minor pacing issues in some longer arcs which left me impatient for the story to develop, however this was difficult to avoid due to the nature of the situations in which these issues occurred, and this was not a huge problem for me.
OVERALL - 10
Basically, if you haven't watched this anime, watch it. In my opinion it gets better and better as it goes on, with some exceptions with early arcs that are outstanding. A fantastic show with a lot of emotion and enjoyment.",10
"
                ive never written a review before but, 8 months later, ive decided i have to. theres no question about it. 
what exactly is hxh, you may be asking. why should i watch it? 
well you see, hunter x hunter is an anime in which satan and god came together in harmony to create. their teamwork is impeccable, as proven by the MASTERPIECE that is hxh.
do you enjoy agony, lying awake at night contemplating suicide, existential crises and bawling uncontrollably in the middle of the day in front of your friends? do you also enjoy shounen adventures that quickly turn dark, or staring at a knife
                  for half an hour thinking about how easy it would be to end the emotional trauma it caused you?
WATCH HXH!!!
ok but seriously
the story is amazing and the development is quite fast-paced but not too rushed. it follows the basic story of a young boy whose father left him, who wants to become a hunter just like his father. he starts his adventure with natural talent and meets kurapika and leorio, and during his hunter exam meets killua who very quickly becomes his best friend.
very happy, huh? how can it all go downhill, you may be wondering. i'm not telling you. find out for yourself. it's a very unpredictable anime/manga because i don't know how any of these ideas were thought of. what drug? can i try it? got mad artists block man
the art... it's not particularly stylized but it is very anime. they're very good at portraying expression and the use of colour and scenery is amazing but it's not particularly striking, like magi or panty and stocking. however its definitely not a bad art style in any way and it's on the better side.
THE SOUNDTRACK... oh my lord the soundtrack.
the opening theme stays the same all throughout and it's very upbeat. the irony. i cant put into words the feels the soundtrack gave me but u will be singing along to the opening and ending theme with a shaky voice n tears streamin down ur face i promise u
the characters felt so real. the development was incredible and you get to see everyone's backstory and every main character has their own arc with further development than you see in most other anime. the characters are the main reason this anime will resonate with you for so long and their relatability is fresh and tubular, dude. you don't even need to be into the story to watch it; you could literally just watch it for cool killua moments etcetera.
this is still my favourite anime except i promised never to watch another anime in my life because of the emotional scar this left me with. thanks hxh
overall 1000000/10 please watch it",10
"
                Man.... Feels..... It was like the whole moment was going in slow motion and i was like - d-d-d-u-u-u-d-d-e-e-....t-t-h-h-a-a-t-t-s-s...c-o-o-o-l-l-l-l.
You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want. -Ging Freccss. 
I'll remember those words for the rest of my life.... rest of my life... believe me.
 A masterpiece. Hunter x Hunter may not be a that much good action type anime to be more precise, this anime may not have that much good fighting scenes like Mob psycho or One punch man or whatever. But, this anime was good in it's own. Storyline
                  of this anime was  awesome. Character development was also done in a rhythmically way. I just caan't describe myself why Togashi went into Hiatus maybe he has his own personal reasons. Whatever, if he ever comes back with a second season then maybe we can get to watch about the outside world Ging mentioned. It will be a masterpiece.
Arigattou togashi-sensei for making this. Please come back from HIATUS. You don't know how otakus from this world are awaiting for you. Onegai.
Sayonara. It was a great experience.",10
"
                I already wrote a review for this series, but I have rewatched it since, and my opinions have changed, so here we go again. I will just start off by saying that this is one of my favourite anime and this will just be me gushing about every part of it.
Story 10/10: Just looking at the premise you wouldn't think there's anything original in it, but its tendency to take usual tropes and show them in a different light is present even in the very first episodes, however subtle it may seem. Then, as time goes on, the arcs become more complex, and more characters
                  are introduced, so much so that you start wondering if you're even watching the same anime. As far as the arcs go, I thoroughly enjoyed all of them, there definitely isn't one I dislike, but some of them are more special, my least favourite being the Greed Island Arc, and my most favourite being the Chimera Ant Arc (of course). 
Art 10/10: It being such a long series, you'd expect the animation quality to drop as it goes on, but it stays surprisingly consistent, and it seems to even get better in the later episodes. All arcs are sprinkled with incredible scenes when it comes to the animation, but the Chimera Ant Arc definitely has the greatest amount of such scenes, and that really makes it obvious just how much love and effort was poured into this anime, which makes me love it even more. I adore brightly-coloured anime, and this one is just full of bright, lively colours, but when it gets serious, it gets down-right chilling, and at times the animation itself has an emotional impact on the viewer. 
Sound 10/10: I am so impressed with the voice actors, for providing voices to so many characters for such a long time, and for really doing their best, so much so that you can hear some of their voices improve as time goes on. When it comes to the soundtrack, the openings and endings are of course incredible, but the background music is some of the best I've ever heard, and I say this as a huge fan of movie and anime soundtracks. In the beginning the ones that most stand out are the kind of upbeat ones, and a bit later on the action ones, such as Emperor Time, but personally, my favourite songs are from the Chimera Ant Arc, due to their use of the violin, and due to the existence of songs such as Understanding, which makes me cry every time about 3 seconds in. 
Character 10/10: This category would be 10/10 even without the existence of the Chimera Ant Arc, but for me, that arc defines this category, because of how the antagonists, the characters we usually aren't expected to care about, are fleshed out, developed, and humanized, in ways I haven't encountered in other media. There are of course the obvious examples, The Ant King and his Royal Guards, but there are others such as Meleoron and Ikalgo, and Palm, and even Rammot, who in other shows would barely get a few lines, let alone real development, but in this anime they get their own arcs and their own contribution to the plot. Another thing I appreciate in this anime, is how the characterization is done. Sure, a lot of it is done through actions, but a great deal of it is also done through dialogue, internal monologue, facial expressions, and at times, even the narrator. I'm definitely not doing it any justice, but this anime does characterization right, and Togashi is a master at making you care about main characters as well as minor characters. 
Enjoyment 10/10: The first time I watched it it sucked me in from the very beginning, I was thoroughly enjoying it, up until about the Greed Island Arc, where I started skipping scenes that didn't have the main characters in them, and then my enjoyment dropped to about 0.1 when I reached the Chimera Ant Arc. I just found it slow, and I didn't care about the new characters introduced, and as such I skipped a lot of that arc. Then, about two months later, I decided to watch the Chimera Ant Arc on its own, thinking maybe I'd be able to enjoy it this time around. I had no idea what I was getting into.
Ironically, the second time around, it felt like everything was moving so much faster, and I somehow became so so so interested in the plot, I would watch 12-13 episodes a day, I just could not stop watching, even if I knew what the outcome was going to be, and I got incredibly attached to all the characters, and then by the time i finished episode 135, I had used up more tissues that I had in my entire life, previously. Now, I can say that the Chimera Ant Arc is my favourite piece of any media I've ever consumed, it is an incredible masterpiece, and I have no idea how Togashi created something so special, but I am thankful he did. 
Overall 10/10: This is my favourite anime of all time, and I really cannot complain about anything. If I really really had to, I might say that it would've been nice if they had made two opening sequences for the Chimera Ant Arc, considering how long it is, and the fact that it had two ending sequences, but that's a personal preference. 
Other than that, there's really nothing I  can say, apart from strongly suggesting to watch it, although if you do, I would definitely recommend binge-watching it, or at least watching an arc at a time, otherwise it might get hard to keep up with, or slow at times. Also a lot of people seem to dislike the first few episodes, but I found them to be a great introduction, so I don't think they're that terrible, if you're not an overly critical person.",10
"
                This is probably one of my favourite anime of all times, and is also a classic.
HxH is about a young boy named Gon who embarks on a journey to find his father. After learning that his father left him at a young age to become a Hunter, Gon decides to follow in his footsteps not only to find him, but also to see what was so special about the profession that made his father choose it over him. Although a story of finding one's father is simple, it is the path that is taken towards this end that makes the series special and unique. Many
                  stories take the concept of finding a father but this is one of the only series that in my opinion had a clear story, from start to finish. It has unique characters and you can always find reasons to like a character. They are extremely well written and have a clear backstory, which is referred back to not too much or too little. I personally love the cast and each voice actor is well suited to their role.
story: 10 (each arc is very creative and has a clear story line.)
Art: 8 (In comparison to other 2011 anime I think that it is very good)
Sound :9 (The sound is engaging and the opening is very good)
Character : 10 (all the reasons mentioned above)
Enjoyment : 10 (this can be enjoyed by all ages)
Overall: 10 (This anime got me laughing, crying, and screaming (?) )",10
"
                Well... this is one of the weird anime I have ever watched. I am not going to say it is bad but I just find it very weird. I will start by saying that I am not a story writer or an artist or anyone who has any experience of what goes into while making anime.
** GENERAL THOUGHTS ABOUT SHONEN**
Since, my childhood I have watched a lot of Shonen anime including Dragon Ball, Naruto and other OGs, but this one stands out completely. If someone who has watched the OGs too they will understand that they follow a very close pattern. A protagonist who is
                  very simple-minded and has very simple goal, a side character/friend who admires/envies the protagonist and a rival who is equally strong or stronger than the protagonist. The same goes for the story and it is very light in nature but exciting and engaging to attract young watchers.
** REVIEW IN A GIST**
This is where Hunter X Hunter starts to separate ways. It wants and makes you feel that you are watching the same old Shonen genre but things happen in the anime which throws you off again and again. Yet, somehow the anime/characters show no emotion or reaction towards it, and yeah story continues... you are watching the same old Shonen once again.
**CONS**
I really hate the fact they have modeled it this way and ruined the potential for a very interesting and relatable story. The characters feel weak in situation like these and the attachment with them fades away. To a point that you might find the second main protagonist more interesting and alive than the main protagonist, Gon. The background music selection also falls off and messes up the environment that was created by a scene previously. I do find it amusing in some sense that nobody cares and characters in serious situation are like: ""Oh no... Anyways""
**PROS**
Overall, the art for the anime is really good. I like the animation and few fighting scenes I have watched.
**OVERALL**
All I will say is don't be discouraged or judge the anime by this review only. I will still recommend hardcore shonen fans to watch it. But this is definitely not an anime to get yourself introduced with the genre or animes itself.
**OTHER NOTES**
I will update the review once I watched it completely and I welcome any criticism from other reviewers. Also feel free to let me know if you felt different or points/places I was wrong at or any other suggestions.",4
"
                I normally don't write many reviews as I am a horrible writer, but I have to say that this anime is a literal masterpiece. When I got to the end I do not think I have ever felt such strong emotions over an anime before. I miss it so much, and I hope the manga gets picked up again. There is a wide variety of development shown for almost every character, even if they are not in every single story arc. Perhaps the best part is that it is unpredictable, you never know if the main characters will fail or succeed in their quests, and
                  if they do succeed-if it was worth the while. This anime has a variety of tones-I have laughed out loud at parts and even cried some towards the end (I'm usually not very emotional haha). Legit made my long and boring quarantine days brighter.",10
"
                This is one of the few titles that I think really deserve the popularity they get. 
It's one of the best when it comes to shounen, but what makes it so good ?
Starting with the story (8/10) HxH has a very well built story, through a senseless adventure to a very deep look at the human psyche. It includes a lot of themes from different genres, and this attracts various people with very different spectrum of interest. Plot is strongly and accurately constructed, everything makes sense, it feels harmony, nothing comes out of the story. 
It never breaks it's own rules for the sake of
                  the plot progression or the hero's to achieve a victory. The series itself is far from the cliché even when it goes by shounen standards. Things like, ""the good guy always win"", ""the main hero must beat the main villain"", the ""power-up"" trope, and even avoiding black and white morality. Togashi knows how to connect so many themes and ideas together brilliantly that the series could potentially go on forever and never suffer a drop in quality.
Next are the characters (9/10) HxH has which is rarely great characterization and great character development. Each character has a special role in the story and they are far from stereotypical. Even smaller characters have prominent personalities, that's if you ask me pretty impressively. The characters sometimes leave the seemingly laid out rules, and become much more than expected, Leorio as example. One of the reasons why Chimera Ant arc is great is exactly the development of characters. Before that arc only Kurapika has a little bit more development, and then after we have Gon, Killua too, and let's not forget Meruem. What other shonen gives a main antagonist character development? What other shonen gives secondary protagonists character development?  Shoot evolves, Ikalgo evolves, Meleoron evolves, Welfin evolves, they all grow and change. They learn more about themselves, and we also learn more about them, because each and every one of them are fleshed out and realized characters. Not plot devices to drive the story, and that's what connects us to these characters and makes us feel like they are real people. When it comes to villains, they aren't only evil. No one is one hundred percent evil, or one hundred percent good. Everyone has a dark/light side to them. This becomes evident later on when the antagonist/protagonist roles seem to be switched.
Hisoka wants to fight Gon, but that doesn't define his character. He has other personality traits and emotions. He wants to fight other people; he has genuine relationships with other people; he even helps the protagonists.
Then we have The Troupe, they may not feel sympathy for others, but when one of them is in question, the emotions are waking. Togashi mostly does not want us to feel sympathetic to bad characters, nor to regret them. For this reason, most of their past is irrelevant. 
The fighting was very good, and it's a much better feeling when we have the characters we care about what will happen to them during those struggles. Not to mention that HxH's battles are more than just punching over and over, but actually use strategy. Since it is not always guaranteed to win, the main characters go through a lot of awkward situations through which they actually strengthen their character. Nen is great power system period. The whole system is fleshed out and makes sense. It gives clear restrictions, and sticks by them. It doesn't say you can't do a certain something, then have the main character do that something just for the sake of plot progression. Gon and Killua trained for two years in Greed Island and they still couldn't beat the enemies of the next arc. And in order to defeat said enemies, Togashi also didn't have to break the rules of Nen, cleverly using the Rose. But this isn't even factoring in the amount of possibilities there are with aura. You could do virtually anything as long as it fits your category.
To note that I really like the fact that female characters are not shown in a sexual way. Togashi's cast hosts a wide variety of people, from transgenders to LGBT to crossdressers. Togashi includes a cast for all people, and treats them all as equals, and i really do like and respect that. 
Another thing I highly value is the friendship between Gon and Killua, 
Of course, the fact that both of them have overcome their problems is a representation of reality. 
Music was all good, as well as animation, I really like the design of characters. The atmosphere is great, the world built in the anime is extremely nice and loving, it leaves a lot more options for thinking than those just displayed. It's a pity that there is no continuation for now, but we all know how Togashi is.",8
"
                Hunter x Hunter is a good anime before i start this is merely the opinion of one person with a rather pendulum like sway of opinions that swings with time.
Hunter x Hunter is a very shonen and also not so shonen anime and I think this comes from the way the author structures his narrative with each arc being a self-contained story or side journey while simultaneously adding to the adventurous nature of the show established in the opening scene with the words
""Fearsome Monsters... Exotic Creatures... Vast Riches... Hidden Treasures... Evil Enclaves... Undiscovered Lands... The word ""Unknown"" holds magic. and some incredible people are drawn
                  toward that magic. 
They are Known as 
[color=green][b]Hunters[/b][/color]
What Hunter x Hunter is a Majestic, Horrifying, and most importantly Adventurous Journey and despite initial setup the goal in the horizon is not the focus of the show rather its a backdrop in this case.
Story 8/10
The story is relatively easy to follow with the main character gon wishing to find his father rather despite this it never becomes the main focus of the story rather it becomes a pretext to explore other characters, locations, and situations ranging in different dimensions of crazy or creative that seem to be messily smashed together in each arc with a sort of self contained story that doesn't seem to be expanded on after the arc is concluded not entirely though with some returning characters though the majority seem to end their involvement after their arc is concluded and it makes the whole of Hunter x Hunter feel like some sort of prologue or at least half complete
Art 9/10
even a jaded lose like me cant complain with madhouse at all
sound 7/10
not bad but nothing that stands out with fights that should have 
Character 8/10
while I did enjoy the cast of dynamic character I couldn't help but feel some characters were sidelined for a majority of the series only to be brought up in the end or straight up had unresolved character arcs with only 2 of the series actually feeling like they got resolved character arcs
Overall 8/10
A lot of why Hunter x Hunter remains such a great anime is how each arc can remain so self contained with the ideas and themes while also developing the characters in a dynamic, fun, and creative way which also adds to the ethos of hunter x hunters meaning which lies in the journey towards one’s goal and the various side paths that said goal can take you on of course each arc has its own string of Togashi creative madness which at times can be too overwhelming but at the heart of the story it goes to show the level of thought, creativity, and love that Togashi has for not just the main characters but for all the characters whose character designs that reflect the uniqueness of the series especially as the series goes on and on the show.",8

                Gon is a child of twelve, in the start of the film he was a motivation to become a hunter to one day know why it's so awesome to be a hunter that a father can abandon his own son, a question that is unanswered through the show because the hunter job life we don't get to know. He wants to know why it's awesome and find his father but not demand answers when he finds him of his negligence. If this show was truthful enough to get the souls of the lovers of the art to cry because it would be a thing to
                  believe and relate because it is part of life, it would be that Gon never experienced what was to have a father while the father is still there somewhere absent and his ordinary friends that SHOULD exist always get the guidance of theirs fathers and Gon not. It could be more humane this way and not so fantasious that I couldn't believe that Gon would get motivated just by this and not a feeling of resentment. His guardian should have struggled as is in the life of a single ""mother"", the everyday food would be scarce so she was hate for Ging and makes Gon not leave for him that he was to run. And because it was so fantasious my being could not believe this. Gon really is alienated from reality and this is the whole history: Inhumane because there is no human suffering as it's the meaning of life to end it.  
In the boat Gon meets Kurapika and Leorio. Kurapika appears to have a intelligence of someone in touch it truth, seeing things as they are and wanting to know even abandoning his sensibility but not at all. He is driven by vengeance searching for the gang that killed all his Uchiha clan to execute his strong justice. What was the killing of his clan ? We never get to the scenes of the mass execution and the stealing of eyes or the dead bodies empty of eyes to get to know this character revenge will. In the film I got to know that he was far away and heard some news...
Leorio is the everyday japanese man masturbating everyday and watching porn. He is the one that anger himself in the face of injustice and was a past like Kurapika not fully explored of a friend dying by a disease, so he wants to become a doctor. He is what you should think to be.
Killua is later discovered and later is Gon friend because they are of the same age. They fight in their adventures together and overcome difficulties together. Then Killua reveals himself as an assassin to Gon and Gon it his pure heart don't react but accept him as a friend.
So after watching those characters interact it each other, it seemed to me that if one of them would ask a question to each about their past, the relationship would dissapear because the characters really didn't knew each other. Leorio is a man of rapid acting justice and ready to take actions to correct the wrong that he sees, so why there were no conflicts when Killua killed the poor kung fu master ? Is Leorio it the intelligence of Kurapika to be assertive in this situation ? No...
So after watching I had this conclusion: There was no truth in this show of how humans act it each other, if it was a decision to minimaze conflict because of complexities or lack of means to a desired end, i doubt. If this show wasn't evading difficults or hard truths, Leorio would have ressentiment towards Killua for killing the old man in the final test also transgressing the rules and common justice.
By this scenario Leorio would advise Gon to stay away from this murderer, but Kurapika it his cold logic would have seen what a sensible Leorio wouldn't and explain to him that he is a victim of hypnoses in all of his life of assassin and make an agreement that Killua would abstain from being an assassin. This Killua would be carrying in his mind into the whole show this belief for him to be friends it Gon as a better person, it the whole group as well. This show was no social truth, it was traces of autism but it's beautiful because emphasises friendship it murderers and sympathy it a pedophile sadistic clown sexually aroused it a boner seeing Gon angry face in the tower tournament and torturing him after in the Hunter arch test killing four or five men. This anime was no sense of morality because it's not truthful.
Later we get to the best part of the anime where the gang that killed the Uchiha clan plans to steal artifacts from a mafia loan. Kurapika learns a powerful Nen. Nen is the power of the characters similar to Ki and chakra. It is the manipulation of the aura the surrounds the soul. There are caregories and types of manipulation. Kurapika is a conjurer so he was a stylish weapon: Chains. Later he will use those chains to kill every member of the Phantom Troupe. This don't happen, he just kills one of them. The leader of the Troupe is Chrollo one man that is a insteristing villain not so cold because he was a passion for poetry but still injust killing and stealing. Whats the history of him and his motivation ? We don't get to know just speculate that he is against Jesus and god  because of his clothes ?
Leorio is you, you are nothing in this show just a friend and a voice. You get your doctor license and don't appear in the next arch and in the next one. Kurapika also is not present. They could have made Leorio it a Nen to heal people and Kurapika to show the functionality of his eyes. But they cut off the two characters that were part of the fantasy. How could they do that ? I don't know maybe it's a morbid sickness, lack of time to create.
Ant arch villain is a villain that they try to make humane to make us have empathy for him again lack of sense of morality. He dies and they try to make us emotionality invested in that moment failure.
Now who liked this sketch trash ? People that are more lies than life. Or have their first experience watching this. Maybe i contradicted myself ? There is a concept that is a lie: Nen. Yes but Nen makes sense because fantasy is a new element to life that can make fit in the world order or not. There is a taking out of order because the characters are not based in real life. So this is art for naive people like me.",5

                HxH = Best Shonen anime I've seen (along w/ Fullmetal Alchemist And One piece) 
Story
The story follows the main character's journey to become a Hunter and find his dad, but this plot is deceptively simple: It hides a much bigger story about the world that HxH takes place in. Although this story never gets a chance to shed light on the world-building, it suceeds in hinting that there is so much more to H x H than any particular character or place.
In fact, we don't get to the foreshadowing and world-building until the second to last arc of the series, which also happens to be
                  one of the best arcs of the series. 
Beyond the plot or story, Togashi and MadHouse have created a beautiful and horrifying world: Greed Island, Whale Island, and the ""Dark Continent""... Watching this show made me feel like an explorer who discovered the fountain of youth. Everything is pretty fascinating.
Animation
It looks childish, but that makes the world even better. By making everything seem childish, the animators make us see the world of HxH through 2 children's eyes---and we slowly come to realize that this world is dark, much darker than we initially expected.
I personally prefer this to immediate gore/darkness because it offers an element of surprise and discovery when the true nature of the world becomes apparent to the audience.
The bright colors and details are also superb--MadHouse has done it again! 
Sound
Perhaps the most memorable thing from Hunter x Hunter was its soundtrack. 
I loved the music so much that I searched up the entire OST playlist and downloaded them! The music is very good at setting the mood---and the nostalgia hit hard when I heard these songs after the anime had ended. :')
While not unique or revolutionary like the soundtracks of Durarara!, Hunter x Hunter's OST offered a sentimental feeling that permeated through most of the series. Ah, the tears are coming again.
Characters
I watched this show on a whim, and the characters made me fall deeply in love with Hunter x Hunter. From Hisoka to Meruem, the ""villains"" are so intensely interesting that it's somehow hard to truly dislike any one of them. And the main characters? They are even better! The character development of Hunter x Hunter is groundbreaking to me.

                Wow, just wow. When I first saw Hunter x Hunter getting all the praise it was getting and how my friends are constantly recommending the show to me, I can't help but wonder why and how one could get such excellent ratings. Of course, this is only natural for an outsider to wonder and since it has an overwhelming yet not so many numbers of episodes, I did hesitate to watch it. It was then a year after first knowing Hunter x Hunter later after watching a few long-running shounen such as Black Clover and Naruto that I have decided to finally watch it and
                  boy did I not regret it.
I'll start this off by talking about the story, one of Hunter x Hunter's best strengths. I'll be honest and say that this is probably the most down-to-earth shounen that you could find out there. Everything that happens is most likely what would've happened in reality if Hunter x Hunter were to be real-life and most of the new elements that were introduced in the show are thoroughly explained, even the minor details. The logic was also on point in the show, there was almost little to no element that did not make any sense in here and it is not riddled with plot armor, something we don't usually see in shounens. The transition from arc to arc is amazing as well, this is minor but makes the experience too much better in my opinion. Saying all that, the story itself is really good in its own rights. Hunter x Hunter holds some of the most well-written arcs, if not, the best in the shounen genre. The fluidity, pacing, and overall how eye-catching each arc is, is just amazing. The writing in here just wipes the floor if you compare it with other shounen. Though after all that I just gave it a 9, why? This is peak level nitpicking here but it's because although it's one of the finest in the shounen genre, it still lacks some elements such as lore and foreshadowing. It's a very clean and linear storyline that is pretty easy to understand and while I am not saying that is a bad thing and I do know that some people do prefer less complex stories as opposed to complex ones, I just feel like it just lacks in that area and that is what puts it below shows like Attack on Titan and Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood in terms of writing. But in terms of pure, shounen-styled stories, it's a straight 10.
In terms of animation or art, this is a big win for me. It has a simple yet elegant approach to the art and it worked wonders, I have learned to not judge an anime by its art style after watching BNHA and that statement stays true until now. Of course, at this time(2011), there are already high-quality animations running around such as Fate/Zero and 5 Centimeters Per Second but the thing that has impressed me so much is that the level of consistency Madhouse has brought to the anime in the whole of 148 episodes. From episode 1 to 148, the animation has been nothing short of sublime, and whilst some episodes might not be as colorful as the other, the animation stays true and there are no random spikes and drops in quality. But yes, this time I am not going to nitpick just because it doesn't have Fate level animation, I acknowledge the difference between a 24 episode show that has the best of the best animation quality vs a 148 episode show that has consistent and great animation quality and I can only give praise for that.
The sounds are overall good, having good voice acting with consistency but well that's the standard for any anime today and 10 years ago, good voice acting so I won't say too much on that. My main criticism is the points where some OSTs are played where it just doesn't sound right and maybe on slightly tweaked circumstances might sound a lot better, it just didn't work at said times and there are a few times where that happened. My other criticism is that there was practically only a single opening song that was showcased and whilst that doesn't bother most people, as an opening guy myself it just feels a little repetitive hearing the same openings over and over again and while I am aware that there are 3 versions, 2 of them sounds almost the same and the second version has the same tune so the feeling of 'repetitiveness' will stay but other than that, everything's good in this department, especially the endings.
The characters are where Hunter x Hunter is honestly unrivaled at, at least for shounens. The show has such a large cast of characters and what amazes me is how they can cater to all the characters, giving each one of them some importance to the show. Every character has their ideals and most of the time isn't the usual cliched character that people would call 'generic'. Character development is amazing too, you can clearly tell the difference between some characters when they were introduced until a few tens or hundred episodes later, how they changed whether it'd be physically, mentally, or relationship-based. Some characters have some bizarre ideals but after thinking about it, might be agreeable. They even give the backstories to minor characters. Overall the depth they give to each character is just amazing.
Overall, I just enjoyed Hunter x Hunter very much. Out of the 148 episodes, I don't think I got bored at any of the episodes that were displayed. It is a very good show and perhaps the best in the shounen genre. Shame it ended on a somewhat incomplete ending if you'd like to say it that way and it will probably not continue for a while or perhaps ever looking at the pace of where a single chapter releases. It was a great, fun rollercoaster ride filled with thrills and emotion but I guess all good things do come to an end.",10
"
                Gon is just a child who wants to meet his father, he does not seek something greater, nor does he even have a goal that will lead him to be recognized or highlighted among the world of hunters, his only ambition is to know why his father left him in that island at such a young age.
That is the premise of Hunter X Hunter, a friendly, cheerful and innocent protagonist who, thanks to the script, has a development that leads to darkness, despair and sadness.
It is a story that as an anime fan you have to see if or yes ever in your life, it
                  shows in the statistics, most of the people who give it a chance make it the best anime they have seen.
Gon and Killua are one of the best duos in anime history, join them on their journey.",10
"
                absolutely amazing anime, and honestly one of the greatest shows of all time. The personal journeys every character goes through helps create a great character development. On top of having great story and characters, the animations is incredible, one of the most beautifully animated anime around. When i finished all the anime episodes, I assumed the episode was over but apparently i was wrong, the show is just on hiatus, which suprised me because it seemed like such a fitting ending. Anyways, I truly hope this show gets the attention and praise it deserves, if you have Netflix, you can watch the first 100 episodes
                  there, and then watch the rest online. I highly recommend this show to any shounen-action fans, that are tired of the typical shows with all action and a weak plot, aswell as any anime fan in general.",10

                This is a review of the English Dub. Some minor spoils ahead. 
Hunter X Hunter is without a doubt the most overrated anime I have so far. Due to the insanely high Mal score, I thought that it would be a long shounen anime done right. However, to my disappointment, it was not.
Story: 4
I will keep this ""Major Spoil Free"". It is impossible to review something without giving away some info. With that in mind, let's jump on in.
The story starts out just fine. I actually like the beginning of the show. However, it is not perfect. There are a lot of things that make
                  zero logic. Overall, however, the beginning of the show is quality shounen anime. Sadly, it goes downhill after every story arc. Each story arc was worst than the previous one. Excluding the final arc, roughly the last 12 episodes, the show follows this downhill spire. The second to last arc, ""The Ant Arc"", was the longest, most boring arc I have ever watched. It should have been half the length it ended up. Also, the ending to The Ant Arc was horrible. The last like 60 episodes left a ""sour taste in my mouth"". Overall story: 4
Art: 7
I will not spend a lot of time on this section. I thought the art was decent. It certainly wasn't pretty, but it was not bad by any means. That's all I got. Overall art: 7
Sound: 6
The soundtrack was hit and miss with me. There most certainly some tracks that I enjoyed. However, there were a lot that left no impact on me. Now onto the OPs and EDs. I disliked the OP. There I said it. Most people really like it, but not me. I did like the EDs though. I especially liked the first ED. The voice acting was fine. I disliked some of the higher pitched voices, but overall it was fine. Overall sound: 6
Characters: 3
This is were the show fell flat hard for me. I didn't like our characters. Killua, Leorio, and Hisoka were cool, but I disliked everyone else. I especially disliked Gon. He was the most generic, unlikeable character in the show. Ging was also garbage. However, this is just my opinion. Overall characters: 3
Enjoyment: 5
This is swayed by my enjoyment of long, battle shounen. I don't think this was a super enjoyable show. That's not to say that there isn't some enjoyment. There just isn't any emotional value when compared to other long, battle shounen. Overall enjoyment: 5
Overall: 5
Overall, this show was just a disappointment. I also think it was a waste of time. I got very little out of this anime. The 148 episodes were too many to get nothing out of it. This is overrated. Hunter X Hunter is an average show.",5
"
                Hunter x Hunter, an anime that sometimes drives people away due to the 148 episodes and the fact that both the anime and manga are currently in hiatus. But please, don't make the same mistake I did and think that because of this, it isn't worth watching. Because it really is. 
Hunter X Hunter follows the main character, Gon Freecs, a 12-year-old boy who lives with his aunt and grandmother, who wishes to become a hunter and find his father - who happens to be one of the greatest hunters in the world. On his way of becoming one, he encounters the vengeful Kurapika, money-hungry
                  Leorio who just wants to become a doctor, and Killua, a boy the same age who comes from a family of assassins.  
Each character you come across has a respectful backstory, some being incredibly unique and all making sense. The characters you're supposed to dislike are dislikable, and the ones you're supposed to root for you end up loving. Then there are the villains, such as Hisoka and the Phantom Troupe, who are just as enjoyable as the other characters. Each one has a unique visual design, with brilliant voice acting and animation that flows well. 
Plus, talking about animation, the fight scenes flow so well, with a beautiful, unforgettable soundtrack. Each character has its own 'theme song', and every time you hear it, your brain instantly goes 'ah yes, this is Hisoka's time' or 'Leorio is about to appear'. Thank you Yoshihisa Hirano!
The pacing was excellent, except for around episode 110-119. This was my only flaw, where an excessive amount of narrating was included and little action (I believe only three minutes in the HXH universe occurred in nine episodes). However, don't get me wrong, this arc was also just as excellent, and some scenes had me in absolute tears. 
Hunter x Hunter was an emotional rollercoaster for me. Although it did take me a while to finish, I genuinely enjoyed the experience. It was funny, suspenseful, upsetting and more, so if you want to watch this show, DO IT!  Because when I have time, I'll definitely be watching it all over again <33",10

                Hunter x Hunter’s 2011 adaptation is praised almost ubiquitously as the greatest shounen anime. On this website nearly 75% of review say that the show is either a “masterpiece” or “great.” A part of me wishes that I weren’t in the 25% minority because I saw a lot of glimpses of what could have made HxH great in my mind but ultimately it fell flat and I feel that on the whole it is an average anime. MAL has you divide your score into 6 categories when reviewing so I’ll share those scores quickly before diving into a spoiler free arc-by-arc review.
Story - 5 Mediocre,
                  the one clear overarching plot point in the show was “Gon wants to find his dad” and the payoff for that was incredibly underwhelming, partially because Ging isn’t a great character in my eyes and partially because the show handled the event poorly. There were individual arcs that were good to great and there were individual arcs that were bad to very bad in my eyes so overall the story was pretty mediocre.
Art - 8 Very Good, this show looks really good and makes some artistic choices during choice moments that I felt paid off very well. Madhouse brings consistent quality to the table and this show is no different.
Sound - 4 Decent, there are a few great pieces in the soundtrack. However the most underwhelming 4 or 5 tracks are used ad nauseam and they are often used at times when the timbre of the music conflicts with the tone of the scene. The EDs are fine, a few of them good a few leave something to be desired but my biggest gripe is that for all 148 episodes they use the same damn OP. It isn’t a bad song but it got old about 30 episodes in and stuck around for another 118. Some tracks are straight lifted from classical music, the chorale from Jupiter from Holst's The Planets shows up in like 2 episodes never to be heard again and Mozart’s Lacrimosa gets used every now and then and frequently is used in tandem with the Zoldyck theme (which I don’t particularly like). Overall some really weird decisions were made when it comes to the music in the show.
Character - 4 Decent, the main characters are the worst characters in the show and only one shows any sort of development besides ‘got stronger.’ I would have preferred this show be much shorter and focused on the second half of the Chimera Ant Arc (more on that later) because the King, Shoot, Knuckle, and Morel who I thought were the most engaging characters in the show by a long shot.
Enjoyment - 5 Mediocre, the show had a few decent highs but just as many lows and the rest was kind of plain. I’ll go more in depth arc by arc.
Overall - 5 Mediocre.
____________________
Hunter Exam Arc - This arc is two standard seasons long and just drags on and on. It has a good start building the world but the actual exam got fairly old fairly quickly. There was supposed a big twist near the end but it was telegraphed from miles away once a certain rule is established. For the most part a similar theme is followed for the next 122 episodes: if a character has no thought put into their character design they will die or never have dialogue, often both.
Heavens Arena Arc - This arc isn’t bad but I feel like the Exam Arc and Arena Arc could have easily been truncated together to fit into 26 episodes total. The in depth explanation of nen, etc. is fairly engaging but again drags on just a little too long for my tastes and I lost interest by the end.
Phantom Troupe Arc - I believe these 20 episodes are probably the worst in the show. It primarily follows Kurapika while the other 3 main characters run around on the side doing their own thing. Kurapika’s story is a generic revenge plot and once his power is explained there’s no tension at all. The Phantom Troupe come up only once or twice after this arc and have no more impact on the rest of the show even though they were hyped up to be super relevant to the main characters. After the arc wraps up we see Hisoka every now and then because he’s a pretty important ancillary character but the rest of the Troupe fades into the background hoping that you’ll forget the abandoned plot threads. There’s one weird bit where a big plot event happens but then they cut to Gon, Killua, and Leorio talking as if it never happened even though it would have impacted their plans and then they find out later in that scene like a full day after the event happened and then they drop their plans to do something else? It's kind of a jumbled mess.
Greed Island Arc - The villains in this arc never seemed strong. A common problem this show has is that in order to convey the strength of enemies the villains are shown slaughtering hordes of rather powerless people. This doesn’t effectively communicate their power, all it does is show that they’re complacent with death. I had no reason to believe that Genthru and his homies were stronger than Gon and Killua but I guess they were because all of a sudden the audience was being told through dialogue only that they were stronger right before their final conflict. It's a fairly standard shounen arc. Characters start out weak (in game), they train (hey Biscuit), they aren’t strong enough, they a. train more, or if the plot demands a time constraint b. set up a trap, they win. Nothing genre defining and no real subversion of expectations that I can see.
Chimera Ant Arc - For what it’s worth I believe this was the best arc in the show. I also believe that this arc was at its best when Gon and Killua are off screen. This arc tries to be more serious but at the same time tries to keep a few pieces of light heartedness scattered here and there and I didn’t think it pulled off the contrast as well as, say, Fullmetal Alchemisst did. (I know that the Hunter x Hunter manga began first, just an example of a show that I believe did pull off the balance). There was so much narration in this arc that I kept almost tuning out, show your audience what’s happening don’t just say “this was the right decision” “this saved them” “he was nervous” I can fucking look with my eyes and see that. It moved slowly and the first third of the arc wasn’t anything special but then they introduced the King. His interactions with certain characters almost made me rate this show a 6 or 7 based on him alone. They crafted a genuinely good villain who was complex and interesting to watch and developed him very well. They made him more likable than the chairman in their interactions which I was impressed by. However there were too many things in the arc that outweighed how good of a character he was. Gon reacts to a death in a way that was fairly out of character (and not justified well enough to feel impactful. I know that the shounen genre is targeted towards young boys especially but I don’t find their characters/character motivations compelling and this is no exception) and only got worse as the arc progressed. The Queen part of the arc felt more like extended filler to try and explain how the King showed up. Character motivations were worn on sleeves and their next actions were fairly predictable (Colt, Melereon, Ikalgo, and the 3 Royal Guards especially). Half an episode is spent giving backstory to a drug lord just to kill him off right after introducing him and never mentioning him again. A poor deus ex machina to make Gon relevant after 55 episodes explaining why he is not relevant in this arc. An awkward “us vs. them” theme that felt a little xenophobic especially as Meruem got more and more humanlike and the theme continued through the end of the arc. Weird orgasming by 2/3 of the Royal Guard in episode 128 that was probably the low point of the show because of how long it lasted. A kind of lame end to the arc honestly, [spoiler!!!!!!] radiation poisoning? that’s how you kill of 2 Royal Guard and the King? [/spoiler] The best parts involved Meruem, Komugi, Knuckle, Morel, and Shoot. Honestly if the show was boiled down to about 26 episodes and was centered around those 5 characters I would likely greatly enjoy it. It was the longest and best arc, but it was still fewer than half the episodes so even if individually this arc was good (7) to very good (8) the rest of the show drags down my rating.
Election Arc - you go from some good intense action, a bit of a copout ending but a firm resolution to HARD HITTING FAST PACED BUREAUCRACY. Half of this arc was incredibly boring (elections involving character introduced just for the sake of having characters to elect for something are not compelling) and the other half attempted to tug on the viewer’s heart strings. If you felt attached to Gon and Killua it likely did a good job but I was never incredibly invested in either one of them frankly and this arc didn’t change that. The reason for the medical problem in the arc is very poorly explained at the end of the chimera arc and if it were less out of left field I feel I would have been more impacted by it. The one overarching plot (Find Ging!) is concluded and instead of taking it seriously the show decides to just make a joke out of it and spoils what could have been a satisfying reunion. There is a second dues ex machina involving a Zoldyck that didn’t exist until they decided they wanted to make it more personal for Killua I guess and it felt kind of hastily throw together to give a slightly more lighthearted conclusion after the Chimera Ant Arc.
___________
Ultimately this show suffers from a lack of focus in my eyes. Each arc is very different and they don’t flow together well so there’s a jolting start and stop every time an arc begins and ends. This is likely attributed to the manga which is affectionately known as Hiatus x Hiatus. The Yoshihiro Togashi had some good ideas and implemented them in some good ways but it seemed like he wasn’t sure what kind of story he wanted to tell and so he tried to tell a bunch of different stories in a limited space. Ultimately I think the effort falls flat because of the length and largely mediocre characters. Sure there are exceptions to the faults I couldn’t help but see but they are few and very far between so the show averages out to be a largely mediocre experience. Half the characters advertised as main characters don't make an appearance in the longest arc, story quality is all over the place, villains come and go and are largely forgettable with the exception of Meruem, plot threads are abandoned as the show moves on, and the overall experience was neither positive nor negative for me personally.",5
"
                Well not going to be a long review I'll just give a gist.
10/10 Story - Brilliant story, lots of twists, air of tension, arcs are great and the flow of the anime is flawless almost to a fault (would quite like some filler for once to be crammed in). 
9/10 Art - Great consistent art, really love the art style. As you go through it gets better (i.e. they go a bit more wild really gives you goosebumps). Would give 10 but story really doesn't give a reason to go crazy on animation like one punch man i guess.
8/10 Sound - Love the soundtrack never
                  get boring, characters have catchy themes, in one of the last arcs it really shines. -2 for the commentator sound he is annoying but much needed.
10/10 Character - Perfect in everyway would only wish to see more, you will probably end up liking the side character rather than the main (not coz gon is bad).
10/10 Enjoyment - watched it multiple times what more needs to be said
10/10 overall one of the best anime I have seen and will probably ever see especially since it was one of my first, unfortunately its hard to find anime of similar quality. Opps quite long nvm.",10
"
                Definitely one of my favorites of all time.  Since I'm sort of new to writing reviews, I thought I may as well give my thoughts on this absolute gem.  
Characters
Starting with my favorite thing about HxH, the characters.  Every single one of these characters has something going for them no matter how much importance they may have to the overall story.  Togashi finds a way to make the most irrelevant side characters lovable, whether it be with weirds quirks, or outrageous designs.  The main cast is also incredibly likable. Whether they're the relatable, sympathetic type, the set on revenge type,
                  or the just plain fun type, this main cast has great dynamics going on between each and Every one of them.  The two main characters have one of the most wholesome, but at the same time heartbreaking friendships I have ever experienced in any anime.  HxH also probably has the best set of villains I have ever seen.  Every single one of them fulfills their role as a villain, and even the worst one of the bunch is one that I would still consider great compared to most anime villains.  HxH has some of my favorite character arcs out there, the ones that I enjoyed the most were Gon, Killua, and Meruem.  
Story
All the arcs in HxH are at the very least good.  The best of them, though, reach heights that I have haven't quite seen any other anime reach in my 2 or so years of consuming this medium.  They are woven together seamlessly by the main character, Gon's, goal of becoming a hunter and finding his father.  And though I don't care as much about power systems as other may, I must say that Nen is a complex one, but it leads to some unforgettable and entertaining fight scenes.  
Art
I don't pay attention to art as much as others do, but I must say that HxH has some very fun and unique character designs.  Some of the background art blew me away and made me pause the episode just to look at it.  So overall, I'd say the art is pretty great.
Sound
Voice acting for most of the series isn't anything that sticks out, but I can think of some parts where I was blown away some of the performances.  The OST is good, and has some standout tracks.  The opening is amazing, and the endings are some of my favorite endings out there.  The endings are what stuck out to me the most.  Pretty much all of them are amazing, but my favorite is definitely Hunting for Your Dream.  
Enjoyment
I pretty much never lost interest throughout this entire 148 episode journey.  It was consistently engaging, even during the long exposition parts, which is something I cannot stand in the manga.  The length for this series, in my opinion, is not an issue, since I just lost track of time whenever I watched it.

                I think one of the biggest things that keeps people from watching Hunter x Hunter is its length. They hear from everyone that it's great, but 148 episodes is a huge commitment. That was certainly my case before I watched it. However, after finishing it, I've reached the seemingly insane conclusion that Hunter x Hunter's length is not an obstacle.
Its a strength.
If I were to sum up HxH's presentation in a word, it would be ""confident"". Half the writers in anime or manga wouldn't have the balls to attempt a lot of what happens in this show, especially in regards to how long certain arcs
                  are. But they're never this long just because they can, but because that's how long they NEED to be in order to communicate what needs to get across. The writing in this show is good, and it knows that it's good, so it doesn't shy away from getting crazy.
My one regret in watching HxH is that I felt like I rushed a lot of it. There were some parts later on that I was pretty sure I was going to like, so I tried to get through earlier parts faster. In reality, all of HxH is excellent, just in different ways. The first arc in particular is seriously underrated. Which isn't to diminish how mind-blowingly fantastic the later arcs are, of course. Just don't forget, sometimes the journey along the way is more valuable that what lies at the end.
What earns Hunter x Hunter its 10 out of 10, other than the aforementioned confidence, is that it has a variety of tones and knows how to use them. Earlier arcs are very light but have a sense of pure adventure with some of the best action beats in anime, while constantly throwing curveballs that keep it from getting even slightly predictable. Later arcs, particularly the Chimera Ant arc, lean far darker, becoming a compelling dive into the chaotic nature of conflict and how fundamentally an experience can change someone after just a brief period of time.
My preferred stories have always been ones that start with a distinct ending in mind and never lose sight of it, but Hunter x Hunter taught me to love the journey.",10
"
                It is a tricky thing for me to judge Hunter x Hunter because HxH features literally all elements I assiduously hate in anime and yet...  I could watch dozens of HxH episodes without skipping a blink. And this is basically review in one sentence. Let me get a bit into details though.
It is easier to start with negatives. HxH is a pure shounen fighting anime. By ‘pure’ I mean “using every shonen trope possible” . Protagonists are male children of genuine goodness, occasional attempts of author to taint them with negative seem phony. HxH is about fights and superpowers: about 70% of screen time
                  will be alloted to various character battles. Lightweight supporting humor is present. Adventure is present too: fantasy world and lots of journing. And, finally and most riveting, HxH is all about friendship and hard work (*sigh*). In fact it is *so* about hard work that I was shocked. 100 episodes of 148 (I mean it) you will hear phrases like “I need to train more”, “I got to get better”, “I am still too weak” every 3-4 minutes. But the problem of pure shounenism of HxH for me is not excessive self-betterment but the fact that the overall screenplay is extremely predictable - HxH follows the trodden path shared by all shounens. Some (most) people like watching through various realization of same blueprint because they like that blueprint. But I do not. If I should decide to give another iteration of shounen a chance it is because I naively hope it will surprise me in some way, that it will deviate. HxH did not deviate, unfortunately, but it *did* surprise me.
But before the elaboration I want to pinpoint another two derivatives of being an shounen. First is a cheap, simplistic picture. I jumped onto HxH after Mushishi and it was like replacing heavenly bath with puddle of dirt. Is being a long-running series an excuse to draw jauntily? Luckily, character and world design is charming in core so it somehow negates plain picture. The second is music. Voice acting is OK but soundtrack… same bunch of vapid annoying melodies, all 148 episodes... Why do you have to be so cruel, Madhouse?
So what is the surprise of HxH? Why does it have such high rating? For me It is brilliant writing and extraordinary production quality. I wrote above about how HxH is being typical and unoriginal but paradox is that HxH is *not* generic at the same time. Yoshihiro Togashi (or people who adapted his script) was at the peak performance, it seems, because he managed turn filthy overused shounen road into beautiful wondrous terrace. His writing, his style, his vision and rhythm are so fascinating and so smart it amazes from episode 2 to episode 148. Yoshihiro Togashi’s best trait is that he always knows where to stop and turn the situation around. While watching HxH there were dozens cases in the story where I exclaimed “Aha! Now you have no other option but to used that stupid cliche! You lost!” but he *always* managed to find a way out. And this other way… seem so natural and fresh, it gave HxH a boost of respect each time and put me back into my noname seat. 
The author’s cleverness and unorthodox approach to the shounen is seen in every detail. Heroes have believable motivation, villains are not brainless “conquer the world” idiots. Every character is provided with rich, logical introspective which makes almost all of them very likeable and interesting. Protagonists’ personalities evolve and change over time. People die, heroes die! Plot often branches into multiple subplots. Narration often shits between multiple actors. Every little character has detailed personality. Battle are… they deserve separate paragraph.
Fights of HxH are probably the smartest component of them all. In fact they are not really fights, they are standoffs. Heroes are put into situations with no clear solution, and often restricted by various conditions. The spotlight of narration will be on the search for winning scenario. In HxH logic and intelligence wins over willpower or goodness (can you imagine). Viewer always will be provided with elaborated comments by the narrator explaining chain of thoughts of current actors. These explanations usually extremely logical and believable. Yoshihiro Togashi’s superpower system or confrontations in general are not objectively the best explained or scientifically accurate but better than the most thanks to the trite yet clever tactic: Togashi does not create situations he cannot explain properly. If he writes something you can be assured there will be no logical holes in the narration. 
Final brilliance of HxH, and the primary one for me, is that HxH is ultimate adventure. The journey to find prodigal father is supplied with such enthralling events in such intriguing sophisticated world you cannot but be in awe in the end of the series and desire more. Modern cities with skyscrapers, serene medieval villages, mafia with guns, warriors with swords, arenas, natural landmarks, dangerous organizations, super families, mystic monsters, internet, cars, ships. The blend of *everything* by Yoshihiro Togashi is, as always, smart thus spectacular and great. Concerning HxH events, aka arcs, they are simply classic, they epitomize how it must be done. In particularly Phantom Troupe, the independent bunch of overpowered villains… yes of course someone did it before, but I am pretty sure no one did it better than HxH at the time. And 61 episode long Chimera Ant arc? It could have been shorter, but do not pretend it was not epic. The HxH plot device that the world is filled with “adventure stuff” is so stereotypical but, yet again, Togashi manages to weave upon it a magnificent background with great many possibilities. 
All the good things I wrote above can be applied both to manga and anime. Specifically concerning anime, I am pretty confident it does every little thing in the best manner possible except aforementioned picture and music. General direction of the series is good and matches perfectly with adventure mood of HxH. Animation sequence did not seem cheap or loosely built.
Hunter x Hunter is a paradox for me: it is a typical shounen but the one I cannot help but marvel. Maybe it is even greater than Alchemist, I don’t know. But I know one thing: I want more. And so I grieve Yoshihiro Togashi clearly does not intent to finish the story. The story where so much left untold.

                This anime is art. I really had a lot of emotions watching this anime, the story, the enjoyment and the character development always catch me, and the animation omg, the animation is the best (Madhouse made a good work in here). I always recommend to watch this anime because they don't fall in the fanservice/filler/repetition they really develop the story in a unique way.
One of the things that always surprise me is how realistic they make the character development, you really can't see an empty character in the whole series (especially because they don't focus only on the protagonist development, they really develop all of
                  the characters) and that's something that a lot of shonen didn't get (naruto is a perfect example of empty characters).
So, if you're looking for an anime to watch I suggest you to watch this pure gem.",10
"
A common note you will hear of this anime is that it is the best of the battle shounen. It has the smartest fights, greatest characters, best villains, and most complex stories, they will tell you. Does it? Not really. There are smarter fights, greater characters, and better villains in other shounen anime. Nor is HxH different from the norm. You have the same types of arcs, the same cast of characters, yelling for power, energy attacks, poor explanations, and there is even a Super Saiyan mode (I won’t give it away, but it is the goofiest super mode I have ever witnessed). It does
                  do one better than the rest – no unofficial filler, though that doesn’t save it from other pacing issues, including a narrator that repeats everything we just saw.
And yes, the narrator is by far the worst part of the anime.",2
"
                There have already been countless reviews for HxH, but after having watched it long ago, and recently re-watching it, I feel an urge to write my own.
I'll start by critiquing how others critique this show. I have read many low rated reviews, and all of them have the problem of not taking the show seriously. I'll tell you what I mean, one of the reviewers said he couldn't believe someone with chains was a very strong character. Yes, that was his critique. That chains aren't menacing enough for him. Has he not seen Kratos from God of War? What I have noticed was, you will
                  either hate it, or love it. There is barely any in-between. I can get this sense, it's not a show for everyone, just as any show is. For example, I could not bare watching JoJo. When I started it from the beginning, it was just so melodramatic to the point I couldn't take it seriously. However, it is what makes JoJo special. That melodramatic is a double-edged sword. It's what gives life to it. So, you're either going to love it or hate it. In my case, I disliked it. And that's OK, but not worthy of a review. It's not bad, per say, it's just not my type. Therefore, I won't make a review for it, saying I dropped it. Yes, I dropped it, but it wasn't because of the bad plot, or the under-developed characters. It was because I simply did not enjoy, because it was targeted to a different audience. Another critiqued it by saying he expected this show to be about treasure hunting, but that was not the case. Again, I don't see how this is a valid critique. You went with an expectation of how the story will play out, but it does not play out your way. That does not mean it is terrible, it simply means, did you enjoy what you got out of it? To answer such a question, you must have been on board with what the show had become. Not to simply drop it because it mislead you. Misleading can leave to surprise and future uncertainty. They were expecting a plot, but that plot did not exist. They were writing the story and trying to watch it too.
Now, I'll start why I recommend you give this a try.
First of, if you like a descriptive fighting system, then this is for you. Although, you'll have to reach about episode 30 to realize why. 
If you enjoy villains with their own history, personality, motives, and traits. You will also enjoy this show.
If you are not all about fighting and more in-tune to wit, this is your show. This show does not have any meaningless fights. It bases itself in reality, fighting would be a last cause, so it happens only when it needs to happen. But when it does, it bites.
These characters in this world feel so real if you truly learn and try to relate to them. What makes this show so special is the protagonists. This title shifts between multiple people as the story progresses and always remains interesting. If you choose to watch, have a open mind. Learn to care about these individuals, for they will be with you for one-hundred, forty-eight long twenty minutes episodes. The development the protagonists flow through is spectacular. A world that is thrown onto these young characters, the choices they make that they forever must live with. Try to show compassion for every character, as every one of them has their story that led them to be the ones they are right now.
I don't wish to get into the nitty-gritty, other reviews have done it much better than I could. This show, however, has definitely changed my life for the better. In the early arcs how the protagonist have a purpose they desire to reach, and how in the later arcs they accomplish what they desire, yet feel so hollow, so empty. As if those goals contain their own problems. That we will never be truly satisfied, and how much we should care for those at the edge of the light. If you are reading this, you have been blessed with good friends, a good family, a good environment. No matter the hardships, we must all strive through, and help each other not lose sight of reality. To not fall into a pit of despair.
This is a story about blissful children, and how they deal with the problems they face. With no one, but themselves and the friends they make on their way.",10

                I feel newer to the whole anime community the more I watch anime, and this creeps me out. I feel that I watch a lot of anime, but then there are people who have lives and are able to watch 100x more stuff than I could. Wait what? Where does this come from? Do you ever get tired of watching the same kind of stuff hundreds of times? These questions always pop up whenever I check someone's mal profile. I feel pathetic, any delusion I had for myself is nullified and I pull myself into a state of this emotional fuzziness... I have no social
                  life anywhere in real life, since I go to school. I always complain about having homework, but there are people here who manage to work multiple part time jobs, and watch anime at the same time.
Hunter x Hunter -2011- is 148 episodes long... I project due the next day. I could never imagine anyone able to sleep for an hour and wake up before I could ever wake up, even if I had ever slept early. I managed to finish HxH 2011 in about a week, probably pretty average for anyone on this website. Lets check the math...148/7....hmm...21 episodes per day, my record for any existing series I had ever watched in my life.
But what is the secret behind this attachment? Shouldn't I be focusing on what is in front of me, like the project? Even I had no idea what I was feeling, and I probably still don't understand my attachment to this show today.
Shounen is for kids...Naruto is dumb hahahaha...elitist criticism is pretty common among younger anime fans-including myself-, and I see evidence of this everywhere, like Youtube comments, and comments on certain websites that turn into cat fights. I occasionally butt in into these certain online 'conversations,' just to act upon my youthful impulse of releasing tension that builds up in me. 
' I grew out of the Shounen genre a long time ago.' As someone who is not yet considered as an adult, I do not understand the meaning behind this statement. I see these comments in reviews, claiming that a series is unrefined because it contains certain childish elements that make the series seem cliche, or not thought provoking and especially: frustrating. Younger fans such as myself would be enflamed by the sense of freedom, being able to establish an opinion for the first time, but the upbringing completely messes up any sense of sophistry 
But what defines certain tastes? Do tastes even exist, or is really just the upbringing and regional/generational gaps that define what opinions everyone has in comparison to each other, on controversial issues? I feel very uncomfortable when I see such a divide, I want it to end but at the same time I contain an extremely high level of hypocrisy. Attempting to answer these rhetorical questions-ironically I'm calling -- rhetorical-is egotistical in respect. Unfortunately, I am also confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience.
{{{{{Your senses are ablaze, and everything hits you at once. Tears roll down your cheeks, you feel wide awake while battling against the droop of your eyelids, trying to keep them open while the sky starts lighting up and the birds begin their routine chirping. What a sensation it has been...but has it really ended? It feels all too real to come to a close. In 30 minutes you have to walk to the bus stop, but the feeling of leaving something you love behind is heart wrenching. The memories created are irreplaceable, the young soul feels at ease. Shounen is the next step in exploration, the medium expands your horizon, Hxh 2011 is the nutrition that fuels what your future tastes will become, and this can apply to whatever your 'first love' is.}}}}}
I feel that I grew from watching this show; although many people who have not had the fortune of watching this show in the early peak stages of adulthood, or those who are too young to understand what it means to 'form one's opinion,' may think otherwise while watching this show in their respective time periods of their life. The young mind is constantly absorbing 'wisdom and experience' while the adult has a rather 'fixed mindset'. Learn from experience rather than from the 'sages and bards,'  that chirp their 'conventional wisdom.'
Opinions on this show are split into 5 categories
1.HxH 2011 is a sophisticated take on the Shounen genre, and is not cliche in a certain sense..{insert list}...
2.The music and art, the characters, the plot, would smash 10/10.
3.Childish in the sense that Hxh is a shounen series, something that everyone can grow out of rather quickly.
4.OMG the best series ever, despite the flaws, the good stuff about the series makes up for the flaws.
5.Meh, its alright; I don't really see anything special here, not my cup of tea, because I have watched so much anime and the feelings I would have had if I had watched this series early, is nullified so I cannot rate this anime high.
And finally, here is what -I- enjoyed about this show.
Story - 6 - mainly because the story isn't completely new, but it is most certainly creative in a sense of how many episodes that the series is able to tell the story in, and not drag it on for too long.
Art - 7 - Bet everyone knows who studio MADHOUSE is...the series isn't completely trying to be flashy, the art is respectable in the Shounen sense.
Character - 8 - No, I do not ship anyone in this series; I like to see the characters interact, and the interactions are gold...this show elevates friendship to the next level, but only on the emotional level.
Enjoyment - 10 - This show has been the most enjoyable series I have ever watched, I mean, I binged watch this series for a whole week so that is saying something
Recommendation: I highly recommend this series.",8

                [Short and Spoiler free review]
Shounen often failed to pipe my interest for a long while until i came around watching this show. When i had just finished episode 131, i really was at the edge of my seat having smoke gushing out of my head and heart pounding as my mind lost ground to the events unfolding at the screen. A true masterpiece of shounen.
Let me be more precise. Out of all the shounen i have watched so far, this is has been the most complete package. There is the typical shounen stuff - power mechanics, skills, fights, villains, you know it, and there
                  is something more sinister. Though the show starts all bright and happy, the story arcs which follow stirs up dark elements which made me cross check the age rating of this show. I think this should be rated R-17+. Humanity, pride, envy, survival, empathy, revenge, the story touches all of these themes at its highest vigor that you just can't help but keep watching in awe as the story unfolds most often in directions you don't want or expect it to. If you are the type who gets attached to the characters then you are in for one hell of a ride. I would say this is the best shounen i have seen so far and more shounen writers should incorporate elements from this in their works. The story progression is reasonably fast and very engaging that i often lost track of time during my watch hours. I do wish there were more seasons cause the story has such a huge potential to grow. Season 2? idk. i hope they make one..
I had one of the best times watching this show... i hope you do as well. Thanks for reading my review. Have a great day! :)",10

                Watching Hunter x Hunter (Hunter Hunter) 2011, I was very surprised to how well the story and the characters were executed throughout the entire series. Although it had a slow start, the story started to pick up very well and kept me entertained for days. The animation and sound quality of HxH 2011 is incredible, given it was animated by Madhouse, a studio very well known for making a plethora of amazing anime (Death Note, One Punch Man, Hajime no Ippo, Black Lagoon, etc.). Although the story isn't something you haven't seen, (Of course, almost nothing is original nowadays), it is executed near-perfect, if not
                  perfect. The enjoyment factor has had me amused for days while watching HxH. Finally, we have the characters. Most of the characters within HxH progress and gain a lot of character development, as well as become much stronger themselves. Overall, that is why I believe HxH 2011 is a 10/10. (Please give me feedback on what I have within this review and however I can improve it, as well as giving me pointers as I am very new to reviewing! Finding this review helpful is very appreciated.)",10

                WHEN WILL THE NEW HxH WILL COME OUT FFS??? WILL IT BE WHEN ONE PIECE ENDS?????? FFS MAN I WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS ;-;...
Truly a master piece when it comes to shounen clean of stereotypical bullshit. Actually characters progress and are not some kind of special snowflakes that are OP af since ep 1. The main characters are still strong but compared to others later on they look like babies. Great and intense fight scenes not your stereotypical after 10 episodes I will use my strongest attack to one shot you because you hurt my tomodachis and I will never forgive you but when
                  this happened it was actually done right. The world itself on terms of fighting is balanced. There are those fuckers that fuck shit up for seconds and are badass (the spider/netero meruem not included since he ain't a badass just a turtle with a tail)  but most of the hunters are not some kind of power houses that are like OPM. They rely solely on their nen abilities and nen is expression on the натуре of the character  manifested in a kind of power. They use tactics/power/items/manipulations which gives the fights actual real life consistency. You can have this mofo that can punch like a nuke*insert never nuke a country twice joke here* also part of the group that has the strongest members alive who can aid him and then there is this boy? who uses chains and has red eyes. Guess who wins and how. Any one who complains that the anime is slow simply has watched too many one shot with casting after 10 episodes attacks anime. Just because the villain wasn't defeated in one attack and it actually took some real progress to get to/fight him doesn't mean the anime is slow paced.
The world in term of diversity has it all. Imagine the WoW map up to the WotLK expansion. it's not as diverse and epic as one pieces world but it still has a lot of things to be explored. It gives a vibe of adventure. There are many creatures that are different from each other. And oh boy do I wait for the Legion (Dark Continent) expansion to come.
Now let's talk about character. As for the main characters I only like Leorio but no screen time ffs. Machi is definitely my waifu and any one who trash talks her doesn't deserve to live. Hisoka is this shotacon vibe kind of guy who is simply amazing and he isn't even that overpowered. Netero is the power house of the anime. This nigga be old af but when it comes to it he fucks up shit like no other. Zoldyck grand daddy has a dragon. Chrollo reads a book while fighting (real chill guy). Meruem gets his ass whooped buy a blind girl with white hair. Kite is no kite so his name is a lie. Illumi has no screen time so meh. And I want to comment one more character but let's not spoil it shall we?
Madhouse does the animation just right for its time and since I'm no art expert will give it a 9 (my 10/10 is all drawn style just like one piece 1st episode for a comparison).
Sound sounded just about right and fitting for me so will give it a 10.
Was a bit annoyed at how slow the ant arc went but in the end it was actually worth it because it had very in-depth details which most anime lack so i can't really give it as a con. Just a matter of taste. Rather than that neutral for me speed of an arc I felt like a kid waiting for christmas with each episode. And trust me every one of it was like one.
A must watch if you want a detailed adventure/shounen anime that doesn't overlook anything.",9

                Hunter X Hunter is a one of a kind masterpiece of a show. It's just does so many things right that a simple conclusion doesn't give it justice.
Story (10/10): The story is fairly simple to understand. Most of the time the premise is very straightforward. But the amazing part is the detail to the story and how it takes every characters thought processes and makes them intertwine with one another. It feels like the antithesis of the concept ""show don't tell"", but works so effectively.
Art/Animation (8/10): The art is very standard shounen style of art. Very simple and easy on the eyes. The animation quality
                  is very good, although that is to be expected form Madhouse. The fight scenes are very well choreographed and outstanding display of animation quality. Emotions are well portrayed by the lighting and facial expressions of the characters
Sound (10/10): Perfect sound design. Nice balance between classical and rock music. The characters personal sound tracks are always a joy to even just listen to. Very nice attention to minor details (Whenever Killua walks there is very little to no sound, implying his assassin habits).
Character (9/10): Very simple characters at first glance, but as the story progresses so does the complexity of the characters. Gon's character growth (or regression depending on how you see it) is explored to great lengths. Killua, despite being an assassin was such a powerful emotional pillar for the latter half of the series. And those we're just the two main characters of the series. There was also a lot of character exploration for the supporting characters and even antagonists at some times. It probably rivals One Piece in terms of character exploration and development
Enjoyment (10/10): It's just so binge watchable, and very re-watchable. The fights are so good, and the show itself makes you think. It challenges the mind and makes it so much more enjoyable. You can re-watch the show and still find something new or see a scenario or situation in a different perspective.
Overall (10/10): It is a literary masterpiece and a cinematic experience. No other words can do it justice",10

                This show was one that was long overdue for me to get around to and one I knew next to nothing about. I knew that it was considered one of the best shounens ever made with one of the most beloved power system put into anime and I was ready to dive into it.
The beginning 30~ episodes I guess you can classify as rough because what these episodes do is serve as the groundwork and pillars of the entire show so it can move as crazy as it needs to without bogging itself down with repetitive exposition. Hell I would kinda classify the first ~30
                  episodes as rough, but the fight choreography and characters we get introduced to are more than enough to carry it.
Once the Heaven's arena arc finishing the training wheels come off and we fully see what HxH is and what it does. The cool thing about Nen to me was how fleshed out the system is. Nen is broken down into 6 main categories which every Nen user falls into for their applications of Nen. The user can train into other areas of Nen but those powers are never gonna be as powerful in comparison to their primary categories. Instead of Nen being nebulous in the way the user applies Nen the user's abilities tend to be directly tied to the character's personality or previous life experiences. This creates a really cool premise for it's fights where everyone is gonna play out differently than the last. In a way this system very much reminds me of stand battles in a way with the way that its never a numbers game its applications of the Nen abilities of the user and being able to outwit the other participant in the fight. In addition to the core pillars of Nen there are a lot of other applications that tend to use the ""storage of Nen"" but these things lend themselves to more support skills.
The way this story handles it's characters and conflicts is one of the highlights in a show where highlights are the norm. Instead of having the big bad vs the good guys for the fate of the world or whatever the characters just exist and cross paths. Sometimes in the story the overarching antagonist never even meets Gon or Killua the main character that we follow for 80% of the story. Any of the characters we follow always have their own goals, this goes for any of the perceive ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"". Everyone has their own motives for being at the setting where conflict breaks out.
The morality of the characters in this show undertones pretty much everything anyone does in the series. Gon is a shounen protagonist so by nature of that hes a paragon (heh) of good right? For the most part yes but a lot of the character conflicts come from Gon viewing the world as a black and white when it comes to moral ethics and not knowing what to do when faced with a situation that are as grey as they come. The phantom troupe while they serve as the group of baddies to go against our heroes, you have to remember characters have personality, motives, thoughts and relationships with their comrades and even enemies in the world of Hunter x Hunter. The troupe of their own set of interpersonal realtionships. A few of the troupe are long time friends, some of them hate some of the others in their group and some don't even know much about others. Each member of the phantom troupe has their own goal and motivations for joining the group but just by virtue of them joining the phantom thieves means they have the raw skill to be able to run it with the best group in the world of HxH that specializes in killing people.
While I would love to talk about the crown jewel of the story: the chimera ant arc, I'm gonna exercise a bit of restraint on that because its one of the best arc in anime I've seen with probably my favorite antagonist of any story. Ever. 
No part of the show feels under realized, the setting the characters, the ramifications of any action in the show or any of the references to real world history. While My Hero Academia sits at the throne for my favorite anime, Hunter x Hunter is eagerly waiting to take that spot away from it.",10

                SLIGHT SPOILERS
I really wanted to give this a 10/10. But there were some things about it that are my reasonings. 
The story is really compelling and interesting. But there were a couple times that it dragged on such as the middle of the York New city arc and (kind of) the arc with the ants. But overall worth the drag. A good thing about the story is that it hooks you straight away in the first couple of episodes. Major reason why it's not 10/10 for me is that they chose to show what happened to each character in 5 minutes at the end behind
                  the ending song. I mean especially with the tease about kuripika (most likely misspelled) and Leorio not getting an answer. 
Art- nothing outstanding, not crap. Not god tier. 
Sound- for the first 30 episodes or so good op nice ending song, but then you realize they keep it for pretty much the entire show. I almost missed the resolution with the other MC's because they chose to do that behind the ending song. Should have had at least one other op. On a more positive note the Dubb is 10/10 in my book.  
Characters- I really enjoyed and felt the characters on a personal level. I cried multiple times towards the end.
Overall- get your animu loving butt over to the web and watch this anime. It isn't #5 for nothing.",9

                Gon, you are light... sometimes, you shine so brightly I must look away. But even so, is it still okay if I stay by your side?""
--- Killua
This is my second review, so I'm still figuring out the ropes - if you haven't seen Hunter X Hunter 2011, I hope this helps push you toward watching it! And if you have seen it, I hope this helps fill in the void left by the series' ending. As many know, HxH 2011 ended two days ago, and even now, I still kinda tear up when thinking about it. I chose the above quote because I very much
                  feel that way toward HxH 2011 - it's an utterly brilliant anime that is sometime too great for its own good, but in the end, I would have given anything to keep watching it - to stay by its side.
I came late to the HxH scene - when I first heard of HxH, I was in a depressive slump in the Fall of 2013, and the series was in the middle of its sixth arc (the Chimera Ant Arc). Hiding from my friends, I was kinda looking for something to just fill my time - what I found in HxH 2011 ended up blowing me away - it lifted me up, restored my faith in myself and in other things, and it helped carry me to where I am now. I can safely say that HxH 2011 has been the most influential anime I've ever seen, and it count myself extremely blessed that I discovered it when I did.
For the sake of this review, I'll be going through each of the categories, explaining my scores for each one, and then concluding with my final thoughts.
Story: 9
The HxH story is EPIC. While I normally hate that word, I can't think of a better adjective for what HxH achieves. The story spans seven completed arcs (the eighth is currently in the works and manga-only), and it covers every possible story type. From romance to drama to intrigue to espionage to politics to adventure to horror to suspense to simply relishing in the power of undeniable friendship, HxH 2011 has something for everyone. The first arc (Hunter Exam Arc) is more exploratory in nature, as it sets the stage for the HxH world and introduces us to the characters. The second arc (Zoldyck Family Arc) really starts to bring the characters to life, as you get to see more into their personalities and hearts, and the third arc (Heavens Arena Arc) ups the stakes and lets us fall even more in love with the characters. The fourth arc (Yorknew City Arc) takes a much darker turn and helps us see the HxH world from a drastically different perspective, and the fifth arc (Greed Island Arc) introduces new plot elements while expounding on the characters even more. The sixth arc gets even darker as it introduces a menace unlike any the HxH world has seen before, but admittedly, this is where some pacing issues come into play. The seventh arc also is a lot slower than the previous arcs, but it is where a lot of the intrigue and politics come into play (albeit, this is why the seventh arc is a lot more serious and seemingly “dull” than other arcs, although I found it fascinating as a political science major). The eighth arc has yet to be adapted to anime, and actually, HxH 2011 ended before they could explore it. Altogether, the story does a wonderful job of keeping you interested and engaged (I only gave it a “9” instead of a “10” because of pacing issues that appear in later arcs), and it leads directly into the next category…
Character: 10
If you noticed I kept saying the word “character” during my “Story” segment, that’s because arguably, HxH 2011 shines most when it comes to its diverse and incredibly-well fleshed-out characters. From the naïve and determined Gon, to the sinister yet sincere Killua, to the blunt yet considerate Leorio, to the vicious but kind Kurapika, each and every one of the main cast is amazingly well-developed and irritably loveable. And this is not to say that each of the main characters is perfect – if anything, it’s their imperfections that drive them to such great heights.
Gon isn’t your typical anime protagonist: while he IS headstrong and innocent, he has a fantas",10

                A Shonen Magnum Opus
This show has been and likely always will be one of my favorite shows ever produced, from the consistently high quality art, courtesy of Madhouse, to the endlessly endearing characters, enthralling world and engaging story that ties it all together penned by one of the very best writers in the industry. Yoshihiro Togashi has an ability to turn an almost unbearably loathsome monster of a character into a sympathetic individual so quickly it's almost disturbing as a viewer and makes you question whether or not your previous hatred was truly warranted before the greater context was revealed, which it often still is,
                  but the fact that he can make you think this way in the reason he is one of the most masterful character writers of all time.
If I was being honest with myself, the main characters (and even some of the side characters) from this show would probably take up half of my all time favorites list, while the other half would go to Togashi's previous work on Yuu Yuu Hakusho. While waiting for his hiatuses to start and stop can become frustrating, as long as he feels that he has the time to produce his best work, I have no problem with it. I honestly place more blame on the studios for demanding such a high volume of work, if he only had to do a page a day (or more if he's feeling particularly inspired) I think it would be better for everyone than demanding a chapter every week. 
That being said, I'd give my left arm to see Madhouse continue this show and I can not wait for the series' final resolution, though I know I'm going to have to, needless to say, this show is a piece de resistance in the catalogue of a masterful artist, once you get past the first few episodes of lulling you into a false sense of security of course. It's a 10 out of 10, I'd put it up to an 11 if I could when Madhouse announces a Dark Continent adaptation, but I think I might die of happiness haha.",10
"
                If you're looking for something light and fun, HxH might not be for you because it packs a proper punch in your feels section.
The story is about a young boy (Gon Freecss) going after his father's (Ging Freecss) footsteps to find out the reason why and how his career was so captivating to let him abandon his duty and responsibilities to raise Gon.
Gon sets out from his home to challenge a whole new world, gain amazing trustworthy friends and face many hardships and trials at only a young age of 12.
Even though the story isn't completely finished yet, this is probably one of the most
                  satisfying ways to end this anime so no worries about a weird after taste after you're done with HxH. (Can't deny that I'm craving for more though)
I hope the mangaka recovers soon and can finish this masterpiece at his own pace, I'll be definitely waiting for any kind of updates!
The art is simply stunning, what I particularly like is the quirky aura of very special individuals is never repetitive, it is as individual and special like the characters that were created. 
Now that I think of it, actually not only art, but sound, character, and the overall enjoyment grows with each arc.
As for the characters, I don't really know how to put it into words without spoiler anything, but I absolutely have at least a handful that grew very dear to me, to the point to make me cry when they do, make me feel sad and smile whenever they're laughing. Even maybe for antagonists, you might find yourself cheering for them before you know, no matter how cruel they are or could be.",10

                I really liked it, it's a very interesting world and story with very likable characters and great character designs. Some parts did feel slow and tad bit dragged out and with sometimes odd power scaling. But the hype moments felt very hype and the intense moment very intense with great animation during those times that kept me on the edge of my seat actually worried about the characters on screen, also making me tear up 2 or 3 times making my nose look like Komugi's. The music and lack of music adds an extra layer to this coming in at perfect times but is sometimes
                  over used but that's to be expected from a long series like this. My favorite songs that always tickle my music bone is Illusion and Kingdom of Predators. Seeing that i binge watched this series like hell, i hope they animate more.

                INTRODUCTION:
Okay, let's start off by saying that this anime is sublimely good and I would recommend it for people who had trouble digesting the original. I wouldn't go so far to say that it succeeds the original but it's on par from what I've seen so far. I'm on episode 83 at the moment, so I've watched a fair chunk in the last 3 days. The episodes go by so quickly, they really don't feel like they're roughly 25 minutes long. 
SUMMARY:
The beginning is slow, deliberately so that it can set a storyline on our main protagonist, Gon. It gives a brief overview so that
                  we understand that Gon is under guardianship of his Aunt whilst his nomadic, almost estranged, father is off completing tasks as a Hunter. We find out that Gon wants to be a Hunter like his father so he can find him and in order to do that, he must take the Hunter Exam and become a Pro Hunter. 
SEASON 1:
The first season is about Gon participating in the Hunter Exams and becoming close friends with Kurapika, Leorio and Killua. That right there, is golden. It emphasises on the importance of friendship and growth. It also introduces a recurring character, Hisoka, whom we can't trust nor distrust as we see him both help and endanger Gon and his friends. 
SEASON 2:
Then season two sees the completion of the Hunter Exam and an pact formed between the four friends to meet in Yorknew City, six months after the Hunter Exam. Each one (with exception to Leorio) has gained strength through the application of Nen, a way of using and manipulating one's aura to their advantage. The season is revolved around the evolution of Gon, Killua and Kurapika. There is a climax which involves the Phantom Troupe, the group whom slaughtered the Kurta Clan, and is he centered around Kurapika and the Troupe. 
SEASON 3:
Season Three was arguably the best, with Gon and Killua discovering that Ging had created the infamous ""virtual"" game, Greed Island, they enter the game in order to find clues for finding Ging. They meet many foes and gain many allies whilst simultaneously levelling up their Nen and strengthening their individual skills. With completion of the game, Gon and Killua happen to misinterpret a clue from Ging and come across Kite, an unofficial student of Ging's. That's where in my opinion, the show goes down hill. 
SEASON 4:
The fourth season is based off of the Chimera Ants and their evolution. It's an amazing concept, one that could very well be a reality soon enough for us, but I hate it. The Frankenstein's monster concept is very daunting and dark. Don't get me wrong, in the previous seasons, with Hisoka and Genthru's abilities on show; the anime has been dark but this is a whole new world of black. With the Queen Chimera Ant discovering the nutritious values of human meat, the season progresses in horror with the realisation that the hatching ants have the agility and strengths of various animal mutations as well as the intellect of a human being. The thing that really makes me dislike this season so much, has to be when Rammota gains the knowledge on how to activate Nen. Sure, it's not a far fetched idea considering though they're predominantly animal based, they have human genes added into their Double Helix (DNA). It's chilling because it seems that Nen is the only way Gon and his friends can fight off the ants but now that they have discovered how it works, it seems that they are in a huge predicament. I didn't expect a whole season to be dedicated to the Chimera Ant revolution but now that I've realised that it's not just a side story, I'm not enjoying it. It has devolved from the original contention of the show, Gon finding Ging, and turned into Tokyo Ghoul or Parasyte: The Maxim. I'm really disappointed but I enjoyed the first three seasons enough to rate it high. This may not be my cup of tea at the moment but I will finish it.",8
"
                In some ways I'm a little torn on this very enjoyable show. This show has true greatness in it, and its themes and characters carry it to dizzying heights. The tone slowly shifts from a fairly upbeat adventure series and  spirals downwards until we reach decapitation, wanton murder, genocide, existential questions of what it means to be human, the emotional connections we form with each other and the things we are willing to do as a consequence of them. It's an insightful, deep exposition that often refuses to conform to the traditional conventions that storytelling of this nature falls into. Each component of the
                  story is distinctly unique,, from a tournament style survival game, to the intrigue of a crime war and a venture into a digital RPG. Its power system is interesting and flexible, and in many cases helps drive the characters development through their choices in it. The wealth of well fleshed out interesting secondary characters is great, and world is often amoral, making its villains fascinating and engaging. There is much worthy of praise here.
It's not without its flaws however. There is no filler, everything progresses the nature of the story and develops the characters but there were points in which it suddenly drags. The drops in pacing were a real hindrance in investing in what is a great story, as they drew you out of the emerging plot lines in a manner that made me frustrated and impatient. The music and sound design was likewise usually great, but sometimes crutched on using particular music pieces, especially when it came to my earlier pacing complaints. It's an excellent show but it cannot escape some of the pitfalls that all these long running shows encounter. But for all that, it maneuvers through them much better than most, allowing it to shine in this formats strength of story and character progression, and it most certainly does do that!",8
"
                When I first started watching HxH 2011, I immediately stopped watching it after the first episode.  It seemed like just another bland and by-the-book Shounen anime.  ""Blegh, just another Naruto or One Piece wannabe."", I thought.  I put it to the back burner and didn't have any plans on returning to it.  But, I kept seeing over the course of the following year or two, extremely high reviews and praise for the show.  Still, I didn't have any desire to return to it, but ultimately, out of sheer boredom, I decided to watch the second episode.  I still didn't
                  really understand what all the hubbub was about, but when I got to the next few episodes and Hisoka and Killua were introduced, I began to see that perhaps this wasn't just another lame Shounen anime.  
As the anime continued on, I got more and more hooked on it, and I found it to be very enjoyable.  However, it didn't really stand out until the Phantom Troupe arc.  I'm not even sure what exactly happened behind the scenes, what stroke of genius inspiration hit the creator of this manga and anime, but it was explosively good.  The entire tone of the anime changed, the intensity level was unreal, the moments and battles were classics, and the entire nature of the anime seemed to shift from ""For kids."" to ""For adults"".  But, not just ""for adults"" as in: ""We are mindlessly adding gore."", but ""for adults"" in the sense of ""We are going to tell a perfectly tight and well-fit story of crime, syndicates, power, fear, aspiration and survival that even the most picky of film critic can find no fault with."".   
Had the anime stopped after the Phatom Troupe arc, that alone would've been enough to put it in my top 10 of all time.  But, after the Greed Island arc (which admittedly could never follow such a tough act like the Phantom Troupe arc), we get to the crowing glory of not just this series, but of all of anime: The Chimera Ant Arc.  Never, and I mean, NEVER have I seen such masterful story telling within a Shounen battle anime.  
The Chimera Ant arc, to me, stands as the crowning achievement of anime.  Whenever I open up an anime, I always hope that, that anime will make me feel at least half as entertained as I was when watching the Chimera Ant arc.  Especially the battle between Meruem and Netero.  That is, literally, the greatest fight I've ever seen on a screen.  But, it wasn't just the action of this arc, but the completely unconventional way they chose to resolve the conflict between the Hunters (and Humanity) and the Ants.  This might be the only anime where an arc ends without the main protagonist and antagonist just having a brawl to finish events.  But, instead it concludes via high level sacrifice and scheming to bring a unique resolution to events.   It was an incredible and surprising way to end things.  
You could tell that HxH really wanted to break the mold of story telling within a battle anime with this arc, by its main villain, The King.  His story was an amazing one, and his character was deeply intriguing, as he wasn't your basic: ""Mwahahaaa!! I'm a bad guy! I want power! I will kill everyone because I'm evil! Mwahaahaa!!!""  He was a complex character who was more trying to understand his own nature, the nature of his species and their place in the world.  Trying to balance the megalomania that his insane power produces, with learning what it means to exist alongside humans and understanding their value through his unlikely relationship with Komugi.  (A wonderfully crafted side-story, as well.).  The character development and bonds of this anime were amazing throughout.  
In addition, that arc introduced my favorite character of all time: Neferpitou.  There are not many animes that produce characters you remember forever, but Hunter X Hunter produced five for me: Meruem, Killua, Hisoka, Kurapika and Neferpitou.   The odd thing is Neferpitou was a villain, wasn't even the main villain, and didn't even get that much screen time in comparison to other characters.  But, there was something about her that I just loved.  She's still my favorite and I sometimes go back to watch some of her best moments in the series.
I could go on forever about this anime and especially this arc, where every episode felt like it went by in 4 minutes, and the drama, suspense had you on the edge of your seat the entire time.  But, suffice it to say, that of the animes listed on MAL in the Top 10, for me, this one most deserves its placement, and should be #1.  Yes, even over Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, which is another one of my all time favorite animes.   
More than likely, you have already watched this anime, or some part of it.  So, there's no need to recommend that you watch it.  But, if I can make a recommendation, it is this: If you started this anime and then got the feeling it's overrated and dropped it, continue on until you get to the Phantom Troupe arc.  You don't know how much you're cheating yourself if you don't experience the Phantom Troupe and Chimera Ant arcs.   When people put this on the ""Greatest Anime Ever"" list, it belongs there.

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
There are many good arcs in this anime such as York New or the hunter exams but one that caught my eye was the Chimera Ant Arc. I first hated it due to it's pacing and I dropped HxH but after rethinking it I decided to pick it back up and that was the best decision I could have made. First of all it has one of the best antagonist I've seen along with three amazingly written royal guards. What makes me love this arc so much is that It really makes you think if what meruem did was wrong. And most
                  people would say yes but I think no, this is because we, humans kill inferior beings every day. Meruem was doing exactly that and I like how this arc makes you question morality and if it's subjective or not. I also love the parallels in this arc including how much more complex gon became. As gon lost his humanity meruem gained his humanity, even if komugi was blind she opened up meruems eyes. This arc is so beautiful and I could talk about it for hours, days even.
There are also many other good examples of great wrtiting throughout the series such as Kurapika and Chrollo's parallel, there many other parallels in the series but this was one of my favorite ones. I'd also like to bring up the power system which in Hunter x Hunter it is nen. Nen is such a balanced and well thought out power system which makes it one of my favorites in anime on par with alchemy. There are also so many good characters such as Chrollo or even Palm, Palm is a very overlooked character with so much more depth than people put her out to be and the same goes for Gon. I've seen countless rants that talk about how gon has no depth but in reality he is an amazing mc. All and all this series truly is great and I could say so much more, I barley scratched the surface with this review but I'm way to lazy to actually go in depth into the symbolism and writing in the series.",9
"
                When I first watched HunterXHunter 2011, I thought the series would be boring because of the pace starting out.  
If you keep watching, you'll notice that the story snowballs out of control as your interest continues to grow as the snowball rolls down hill. 
Trust me, keep watching the series to learn more about the characters and how the writer cleverly builds up anticipation to the fight scenes.
I would not recommend this series to the simple minded as the level of attention needed to understand everything that's going on could confuse the viewer.  Paying close attention to every detail ensures the viewer will
                  receive full enjoyment and understanding from the series.",10
"
                This review will probably get me a lot of hate and raised eyebrows from HxH fans, but please read it with an open mind. I do try to be as objective as I can with my review, even though enjoyment is purely subjective. Perhaps I expected too much from the hype with which my friend recommended this series to me, and thus was left disappointed when it failed to meet my expectations. HxH is still a solid anime, but I don't think it is as amazing as many people say. 
Story: While I do think that HxH has the best writing for contemporary shonens, it
                  is not flawless. The plot is pretty simple and typical - adventurous shonen, with Gon setting out to meet his scummy dad. There's not much layered mystery or anything like that. No Pandora boxes to be opened here. But HxH succeeds in building a very creative and interesting world. Togashi is also good at surprising the audience. It is quite hard to predict what is going to happen next. There is not really any shocking ""plot twist,"" but unexpected developments are not uncommon in the story. 
The story doesn't go from good to great until Yorknew Arc, however, and for many people, not until Chimera Ant arc. I came in with a lot of expectations for CA, but the dragging pacing of this arc irritated me so much. I know many people don't mind the slow pace, or even think the pace is perfect, but seeing Ikalgo the octopus keep on whining and crying, unable to bring himself to kill, and Mereum's subordinates yell ""Ouuu"" every 3 seconds vexed me to no end. I had to skip forward. Yes, I know Ikalgo's inner conflict was integral, but did they really have to drag it out that long? Additionally, when Mereum lost his memory, I felt like I was watching a K-drama with the amnesia trope. 
The story also relies on many plot conveniences that range from minor to major. There are random strangers who take interest in our main characters and guide them. Kurapika meets a random dude in the forest to help him gain his nen. Killua and Gon, on every adventure, have someone look out for them because they are iNteResTiNG. I find it funny, but these minor conveniences don't bother me that much. What bothers me is Alluka's existence and vast powers. It is hard for me to believe that Killua just forgets about her whole existence until Gon is seriously injured. Alluka is pretty much a plot device to save the protagonist. Killua can also use Alluka's power without any consequences because Alluka loves him. Talk about convenience. Why didn't Killua use her power to destroy the ants and save Kite before? And if Gon hadn't been injured, would Killua just ignore Alluka in the basement to rot for the rest of her life? So many questions.
Greed Island was very interesting, but I can't help but think ""how does this work?"" Did someone with the nen power to create a virtual reality create Greed Island? This sounds very Black Mirror and ex-Machina, and while it doesn't affect my enjoyment of the series, I can't help but ponder about the existence of it and what it means for the worldbuilding.
Character: I love the characters. I think they are lovely. However, while many of the characters are well-fleshed-out, some aren't. There are amazingly well-written characters and there also amazingly flat characters. Out of the four main characters, only Killua and Kurapika are very well-written. Gon is quite simplistic in his thinking, and while we do see that he hides a monster inside, we do not get to see how his development. After getting his revenge and putting his best friend, Killua, in danger to find a way to save him, the only thing we see is an off-screen apology from Gon. We don't know if he realizes revenge is bad, or that losing himself to rage is bad or not. Also, Gon at some point said he didn't want Kurapika to become a murderer because of revenge, and yet Gon went and do exactly what he was against. 
Leorio? More like Leori-go. He's just a supporting recurring character, although his face is on the poster for some reason. I wanted to see more of him because throughout the first arc, he was just being an incompetent baggage of the team that got lucky to be carried. In the end, he appeared and punched Gon's scumbag father, which is nice, but that isn't much of a development if you ask me.
The Chimera Ants are well-written, and to some extent, the Phantom Troupe members too. They are all very interesting, but I don't think the PT members are as complex as people say. They are like yakuzas. Strong brotherhood, but with little understandable/sympathizable motive. They're outcast of the world so now they like to kill people for funsies and are like the outlaws. Perhaps some people like that, but because their reason for murdering people feels, to me at least, unconvincing, I am not attached to them. I feel like any viewers like to make them out to be nicer than they actually are.
There are also disgusting characters like Palm who is literally a pedophile but somehow I am supposed to like her because she is portrayed in a positive light at the end?! I am confused about that. It's not too big of a deal, but damn, can't the author at least get her to apologize to Gon for hitting on him when he's 12? 
I make HxH sound like it's bad. It is not, by any metrics. It's a good show, but I think it is overrated. This will anger the HxH elitists, but just because somebody doesn't give HxH an immediate 10, it doesn't mean they hate on the show.",7

                I am in love with this anime. Here's why you should watch it! Without spoilers ofc!!
-Story and Characters 
Story looks like a basic story at first but it has great character developement and it's not repetitive. Characters' designs are great and they have very great relationship and personality developements. This  made me so attracted to this anime. You can literally say ""wow they grew up"" when you finish it. 
-Sound
Opening and endings are AMAZING. Also character themes and extra songs are very good, voice actors are very talented.
I really enjoyed watching HxH, I finished all episodes and movies in 5 days. That's how good
                  it was. It makes you watch nonstop. Some people might say ""...arc was so boring, i skipped it."" etc. Don't listen to them!! Don't skip arcs they are very important!! I enyoyed every arc and  I wish there was more episodes! Hxh quickly became one of my favorite animes and I can't get over it.",10

                Story:
Hunter Exam: 9/10
Zoldyck Family arc: 7/10
Heaven's Arena arc: 8/10
Yorknew City arc: 10/10
Greed Island: 7/10
Chimera Ant: 9/10
Chairman election:7/10
Ill only speak about the top 3 arcs in my review. Firstly the Hunter exam was a great arc and they executed it perfectly to start the show off. But in my opinion the yorknew city arc is easily the best arc in the show and is also easily one of the best arcs out of any anime ive ever watched. I'll leave those 2 at that. Now for the chimera ant arc the heavy narration ruined my enjoyment first time I watched it, which was on a weekly
                  basis. Just imagine waiting a week just for the narrator to talk for 20 mins. Watching it weekly I would give the chimera ant arc a 5/10 but if you're binging then I give it my initial rating of 9/10. Overall the story was one of the strongest aspects of the show. Truly something amazing.
Story 10/10
Art: The art was great in the show. The characters were detailed and you could feel the character's personalities through the drawings. Also the battles in this show were magnificent. They were monumental at every single moment.
Art 9/10
Sound:The soundtrack was good, the opening and endings suited the anime but I wouldn't listen to them on my own time. 8/10
Characters: Gon is one of the best protagonists I've seen in a shounen. I like how he isnt a complete pussy and doesnt blink twice when a stranger dies. Other than that hes pretty stock. Killua is a cool character but his background is what makes him very interesting. The Zolydck family 
are cool as hell and are interesting characters. Leorio and Kurapaki are OK characters, nothing special especially since they dont have major roles in majority of the episodes. The villains whether it was the phantom troupe or chimera ants, were all great villains. They were cool, overpowering and evil. All in all the characters are one of the best aspects in this show. 
Characters 9/10
Enjoyment 10/10. One of the few animes I can say I wholeheartedly enjoyed from start to end.
Overall I give the show a 10/10 and it is a must watch. I dont think there are many animes on hunter x hunter's level let alone above it. Anyone who gives this show a bad score just wants to go against the grain because no sane person can tell me this show is bad.",10

                SPOILER FREE***
If there were ever a 2/10 show this is it! Apparently I'm not in on some kind of unfunny joke but this show is unendingly recommended and heavily praised seemingly without merit. Folks are free to like what they want but this show is anything but excellent, perhaps suitable for grade aged children. There are some incredible shows but this is not one of them. On the contrary, be prepared for mostly non-sensical mediocrity.
Story:
The chosen one heroin and a team of mostly uninteresting one-dimensional characters make their way through an illogical world of adventures. If your looking for a good story there are much
                  better places to look than this anime. It might be acceptable for kids under 10 though who want to watch something while turning their brain off. Just not a lot of rational world building or storytelling.
Character:
Again, the chosen one and his team of merry boys and guys stumble upon on adventure after another while making sure to have as much filler as possible; not that the main story is any bit interesting. This is a show with mostly children characters in a children adventure, not much more to say as they are mostly uninteresting and boring.
Overall:
This anime does not meet any of the praise it receives, that might say more about the fanboys than it does about this anime. Best way to describe it is its almost like it was made by kids for kids. You could skim through the anime just to see what its about, but more than likely you'll still be left wondering what the hype was about.",1

                When I first read the description of this show, I was EXTREMELY skeptical.. I mean, c'mon, an eleven year old boy? really?!
BTW, do NOT judge anything by it's synopsis lol. This show will have you binge watching from the very get go! If not the main character, the support characters will definitely have you pulled in! (trying not to spoil to the max)
Let's just say that the main character + his ""best friend"" turn out to be absolute prodigies. This is a must-see no doubt! AND let's all vote that there should be more to it no matter how old it gets before it does
                  :P
(p.s. I mean let's think about this... They are just NOW coming out with the ENG dubbed version, we can't give our hopes up for more of this series... right?) HxH <3 4ever",10
"
                When I started watching HxH I didn't know what to expect. I haven't read the manga or watched the 1999 version of the anime. Little did I know I was in for long ride of emotions & feelings which seemed to increase even more towards the end of the show. HxH is not very battle heavy shounen anime and the battles seem to be short or less impressive than in most other animes.
Pros:
I have to say that the Hunter exam arc (first 21 episodes) were without any doubt my favorite part of this show. Story progressed fast and was interesting during this entire time. All
                  the characters seemed to have a role to play and the execution was perfect.
This show has perhaps the best endings I've seen in years. Overall music is amazing and is carefully tailored to fit every setting.
Majority of the characters are written extremely well. Nobody is perfect without flaws and the show really lets the viewer to know that. People will have panic attacks and mental breakdowns and it is quite something we don't always see in shonen anime.
Cons:
There were couple of asspulls during the show which certainly made me raise an eyebrow more than few times but they weren't big enough to ruin the entire experience and the storytelling managed to cover these mistakes quite well.
Second problem I have with this anime is its concentration to characters/action at times. There are times where story keeps jumping between certain key characters even when they are in the middle of fights or in the middle of some weird internal ""battle of the minds"" dialogue. Some of the fights happen offscreen and viewer is only shown the result. This is was a bit insulting to me since we are talking about shonen anime here.
I'm giving it 9/10 for excellent entertainment value and big recommendation.",9
"
                okay if ur just contemplating if u want to watch this, just watch it it's a great show. To be honest I have been putting this show off for a long time for the bad art and how the main characters are kids and how it's pretty long. But when I started watching this I found myself binging the whole show in 3 days c: what u will find in this show: main character is simple strong hearted and is the type that makes friends easily and attracts people, the best friends white headed dude is really talented and has family issues, its pretty typical
                  shounen show, they face problems and issues and go on adventures until the mc reaches his goal. you will also find an AMAZING VILAN WITH AN AMAZING VOICE AND THEME SONG I LOVED HIM SO MUCH. Just watch the show u wont regret it i promise c:",10

                [Spoiler Warning]
Flawless adaptation, Hunter X Hunter is one of the best shonen manga and Madhouse adaptation elevated it to be the best one in anime. Consistent every chapter and without almost any form of filler is a pleasure to watch.
  Story: Hunter x Hunter story is about a boy searching for his father and nothing more around the main story than that besides spoilers in the manga. Hunter x Hunter REAL story is around his arcs, is an arc based series rather than other ones like naruto or one piece where they have a main story. 
  But that doesn't make hxh
                  inferior, at the contrary it has imo the best story arc ever created in shonen (chimera ant) and what makes it better than naruto for example is that this series have sense in every way, almost everything that happens in hxh have sense (literally almost everything, Togashi even took the work to create the most polished battle system ever) and that is a plus considering shonen deus ex machinas. Another thing that is a plus is that like One Piece hxh plot feels connected and they are not arcs just for the sake of make more arcs.
  I give 9 in this section just because Greed Island, a ""short"" arc that stills feels dragged because all the unnecesary information to advance the plot in this one, plus forgetteable villians (is like skypea in one piece but shorter and the second half still doesnt get good)
  Let me write one thing i just remember, Chimera Ant story arc is the most interesting arc i saw in shonen, full of interesting thoughts about humanity and how we could act if a superior species apppears to erradicate us and what happens if that superior species takes our good and bad traits. The only thing that i have with this arc is 2 imo bad episodes. Imagine what a masterpiece it is. 9/10
  Art: Madhouse are GODS, 148 chapters with consistent quality, climax moments in the series animated to perfection, just look at *SPOILERS* Ryodan requiem for Uvogin in 99 and 2011 and see the difference for yourself *SPOILERS* is a pleasure to watch every chapter, just thanks to god that Madhouse is real and they were the ones that animated this series. 10/10  
  Sound: Chimera ant arc has the best ost ever made in shonen and Ending 2 and 5 are easily top 10 endings in anime, besides that at the beginning of the story the ost is repetitive and misused a lot (literally there is a happy song next to one of the most emotional scenes in the series), but that are small things it is still one of the best ost ever made for a shonen
  Just something that i remind... Please take attention to killua footsteps, in one moment in special is the only time they can be heared. 9/10
  Character: Killua Zoldyck and the Chimera Ant main antagonist are best protagonist (along with Gintoki) and villian made in the genre period, then you have your typical long running series memorable and forgetteable characters, it isn't like One Piece where almost anyone is extremely charismatic and memorable but almost all of them have character development and someones like the ones i just mentioned have character growth... something that isn't very common in shonen. 9/10
  Enjoyment: I didn't enjoy the first arc just because my friends gave me the hype that i was going to see ""the best series ever""... I remember when killua thinks that he have the same age as gon so because of that he thinks about make a firendship with him, I compare this to how Johnny and Gyro meet and the later one was vastly superior than hxh one. But after that arc i started to enjoy hxh a lot until Greed Island that i just wanted to skip... Then it becomes the best shonen anime after Greed Island...
  Dont see this as ""The best series ever"" hxh isn't that. But without a doubt after chapter 73 becomes at least a god tier shonen series, nothing to envy to other ones like Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Gintama or even One Piece manga. 9/10
  Overall: Madhouse adaptation of Hunter x Hunter is without a doubt a shonen masterpiece elevating the manga a lot, fixing a lot of issues that it has and animating the best arc ever made in the genre flawlessly, it isnt the best series ever hell even the best anime ever. but it is one of the best (for me the best) shonen animation ever made until this point. 9/10",9
"
                I admire Hunter x Hunter for a lot of things. I admire the way its plot arcs boldly switch genre and vibe, from generic video-game to gritty crime thriller and more. I admire how the show can drop (or even kill) important characters. I admire the striking use of a narrator, who interacts with the story more than you’d expect. I admire the creativity of the world, and I especially admire the creativity channeled through Nen, one of the best, most consistent and complex shounen power systems I’ve encountered.
Yet, these things for which I admire Hunter x Hunter so much also make me dislike it.
                  Hunter x Hunter just doesn’t behave like a normal story. Characters you want to learn more about disappear for dozens of episodes at a time. The narrator becomes overused and insufferable at many crucial moments. Plot and pacing inconsistencies abound thanks to the constant shifting of genres. Even bits of world-building end up being inconsistent as the story continues on. It’s clear that Yoshihiro Togashi, the creator of Hunter x Hunter, didn’t plan ahead for much of the story, and that results in something that is both refreshing and annoying.
For me, Gon and Killua were what held Hunter x Hunter together. The true deuteragonists (the other two in the poster are only relevant at first), Gon and Killua’s friendship and character developments kept me coming back for more. Although I find the in/famous Chimera Ant arc frustrating and ultimately unsatisfying, I love the development it gives both the mains. Even though both characters suffer from serious plot-armor/invincibility and are never in any serious danger, I grew to love those boys to insane degrees and my heart started breaking whenever things didn’t go well for them. Still, I found the other characters (and even many parts of the world) to be hit-or-miss. Gon and Killua were worth it for me, but two little boys aren’t always worth 148 episodes.
So does anything else make those 148 episodes worth it? Depends. As I’ve already implied, I find the plot to be hit-or-miss. The world-building fares slightly better, but still ends up being inconsistent enough for me to think of it as hit-or-miss. Meanwhile, though, the art and animation fare incredibly well. I’m not sure how Madhouse did it, but all 148 episodes fly by without a noticeable drop in quality, which I find hugely impressive. I also think the soundtrack is phenomenal, though a somewhat acquired taste. Much of the score is borrowed from classical music, from Mozart to Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring.” The scoring choices are so unique and nuanced, I’m pretty sure I could write an entire dissertation on Hunter x Hunter’s score. And of course, the Japanese voice cast is amazing. Mariya Ise is simply incredible as Killua.
I don’t think Hunter x Hunter is a masterpiece as its current MAL score might imply. But, I do think Hunter x Hunter is a very special anime. Is it worth 148 episodes? For me, yes, but not for everyone. If you like world-building and are seeking something that doesn’t follow the tried and true storytelling mechanics (and like a good, long, bittersweet epic of friendship), Hunter x Hunter might be up your alley. Otherwise, it’s probably not worth its episode count.",7

                I had no idea what I was getting into when I first made a choice to watch this anime. At first I thought it looked like a children's anime or cartoon, and has a childish story with it. And watching the first few episodes, I thought my deductions were right but BOY WAS I WRONG. 
HxH really had every genre you wanted it to be. Every arc was so engaging and new that you couldn't help but be at the edge of your sit with every episode. What astounded me in this anime was that the story felt so free. Like HxH can take on
                  any story, any genre or any idea and make it into an engaging ride for the viewers. This anime has no boundaries. It's definitely a rollercoaster ride.
Now if you're looking for something exciting, fun and ever so heart wrenching all at the same time, please don't ignore this anime. As someone who's gotten into shounen recently, I am so glad I did not pass up this anime. And so should you.
Story: 10/10
It's my first time experiencing so many twists and turns in every arc that I was never bored with the ideas this anime threw at me. But of course the most memorable arc has to be the Chimera Ant arc. That arc teared my heart in so many ways. I did not expect that HxH had the capability to do so. And here I thought I wasn't going to like that arc but how wrong was I again. Definitely the strongest of all arcs. But my favorite has to be the Hunter Exam arc. It's what started everything and still remains iconic.
Art: 9/10
Well I have to be honest since my first impression on the anime was that it was childish, well it was because of the art style. And I'm ashamed that I judged HxH too soon. The animation gets better don't worry. And the art style is not at fault, it's mine.
Sound: 9/10
The background sound always cheers me up when the episode is going near the end. It's like it's urging me to watch the next episode. For the opening and ending song, at first I wasn't that hyped up about it, like it wasn't that good to be honest BUT since the opening song remained the same throughout the whole 148 episodes, it remained stuck in my head that when I finished the whole series, I began to miss it soooo much. It was like an anthem for HxH. ""YOU CAN SMILE AGAAAAAIIIN"" remained in my soul after this like YES THIS IS MY JAM.
Character: 10/10
Ugh the characters of this anime is such a masterpiece. You can't argue with me. This is the first time where I experienced in an anime where the main characters of the story are not always together throughout the 148 episodes. I'm not kidding. Although Gon and Killua were one of the main and was together throughout the journey, Kurapika and Leorio were not much shown for the rest of the arcs BUT that's why the four of them reuniting makes it more precious. It's so amazing that right from the beginning each one of them had different goals (well for Killua he's still finding it but accompanying Gon became his goal throughout the journey but not his final). So that's why their paths never match and they had to find their own journey throughout the series. I love that this anime gives us viewers the point of view of not only Gon but with the rest of the characters.
So I'm just going to lay out my realizations for these two characters: Gon and Killua.
For Gon who smiled and worked hard at everything, who would've thought that he'd have such a dark side to him? 
For Killua who looked so cool and who we thought had everything under control, who would've thought that he'd show such vulnerability and affection throughout the series?
Enjoyment: 10/10
Uhhhh DUH of course a perfect 10. Never got bored. Even though I laughed at the first few episodes because I thought it was childish, hey I didn't stopped did I? Just goes to show how much I enjoyed and wanted to continue the anime.
Overall: 10/10
A MASTERPIECE. Beginning until the end. I wasn't disappointed. Although I wanted more, however, I thought the ending was befitting. The arcs did justice to contribute to the diversity and uniqueness of HxH. The characters learned, grew and had so much impact on every episode, I wanted to embrace them for a job well done. And for the creator Yoshihiro Togashi, I'm such a fan /cue tears/.
If my review still didn't convince you to watch the 148 episodes of HxH because you think it's too long, then you're definitely missing out on something worth more than 148 episodes.",10
"
                Disclaimer: If you're going to watch Hunter x Hunter, please enjoy every moment. Before you know it, 148 episodes will go by in a flash.
Originally, I was bored one day and was looking for an anime to watch - that's when I remembered Hunter x Hunter, a show that many described to be a masterpiece. Truth is, a few months ago, I had tried getting into HXH but stopped after ten minutes into the first episode. 
But this time, I just needed a time-waster, so I went through episodes 1-3. It was pretty okay so far, I liked how Gon and Killua became friends right
                  away. Continuing to watch the anime, it wasn't until episode 20 that I realized this anime really had potential. I'm a picky person, so it's not surprising if I watch a lot of episodes in an anime and then suddenly drop it. However, that was not the case with HXH - every episode was like being on a rollercoaster slowly going upwards. Each ep really only got better and better. 
I realized that I was addicted to HXH once episode 30 hit since I was using all my time in the day to watch the anime. I'm pretty sure one of the main reasons my love for HXH kept growing after each episode was because of Gon and Killua's friendship. They're really a dynamic duo, balancing each other out with them being polar opposites. If the whole anime was just Gon and Killua's friendship, I'd honestly still love it and recommend it. With that being said, you need to watch HXH because it's definitely not your typical shounen anime. It can throw you off in a second and then force you back on your feet, but that's what makes it special.
To describe how much I love this anime, I wish I could erase my memory and watch all 148 episodes again.
-Spoilers Ahead-
I really loved all the arcs, and my favorite would probably be the Greed Island one. But when the Chimera Ant arc came on, I was honestly surprised and confused at first. It came out of nowhere, rapidly-evolving ants that are born from a Queen eating stronger and stronger humans. 
TBH I had decided if I really wanted to watch the whole CA arc or just skip most of the episodes, since it's way longer than the other arcs. In the end, I pulled through but it really took the triple-digit episodes to kickstart my excitement. From Kite's death to Gon going batshit crazy and Killua not being able to do anything, it took all my focus and attention. 
Now I'm going to talk about EP 147. Yup, the very one where Gon and Killua go their separate ways. It was a tearjerker and the fact that HXH has a high chance of not finishing breaks my heart even more. I would seriously love to see a reunion scene between the two main boys, but it might take 5 to 10 years for that to happen with how the manga is going right now.
But in the end, I'm just really glad I found HXH. It's now in my Top Ten anime and it might even be number one. 
If there was never a remake of the 1999 HXH version, I would never be able to witness this masterpiece. So thanks to everyone who made this possible, and I'll be awaiting the day Gon and Killua reunite.

                Hunter X Hunter will always have you at the edge of your seat. The plot is extremely well developed and flows exceptionally well, with intriguing twists and cliffhangers. Furthermore, the characters are extremely well developed. It seems as if you are their best friend who hear their every thought. The writers do such an outstanding job of developing and making each character unique, with each one having a different moral and personality. However, the show is lengthy (148 episodes), and I do not recommend it if you just want a quick, fast moving anime. Even though the show does seem to have some unneeded parts
                  that could be combined with other episodes to make less dull time, it does a great job of changing things up. For example, each arc keeps the same story, but changes scenery and mood, allowing for a much more enjoyable viewing experience. I highly recommend Hunter X Hunter if you are looking for an anime to watch over a long period of time.",9
"
                Before my review is taken into account, I must confess that Hunter X Hunter was the first anime I had seen. Therefore it should be clear that this is coming from an unexperienced anime fan. Therefore I feel I can only write my review on the storyline and characters as I am someone who may not appreciate the art and sound of HxH as much as an anime connoisseur.
 HxH is broken into 7 arcs and so I will therefore review each arc individually with a summary at the end. 
 1)The Hunter Exam for my is the second best arc. At first, I was
                  unsure. The main character 'Gon' annoyed me at times with his immaturity and ignorant optimism. However this was short lived. I began to appreciate him for these qualities as I found the contrasted and was often a refreshing light on the seriousness of some tasks in the exam. Hisoka was also a highlight of the first arc. The villain was unlike anything I had seen and his mannerisms along with personality traits both intrigued and sometimes shocked me as a viewer. Overall I give the arc 9/10 and felt it was a perfect start to the 148 episodes.
 2)The Zoldyck Family arc, for me, was a let down. As a viewer with a slight distaste for the character of Killua, I felt this arc was a detour from themes which were more interesting to me and felt myself feeling as though I just wanted to get through it for the next arc. This is not to say it was a complete waste of time however. The scenes with Gotoh's coin scene was thoroughly enjoyable and I found Silva to be an interesting character, however brief his appearance. Unfortunately this is somewhat clouded by the first few episodes of the arc and the trials the characters must overcome which slowed the pace following the Exam Arc's finale. Overall I give this arc 6/10 and was glad it didn't last too long.
 3) What a story. The Heaven's Arena Arc was for me, by far the best of the show. The concept of the arena was intriguing and the execution of the fight scenes in this arc were phenomenal. The character development of both Gon and Killua was good and Wing and particularly Zushi were fabulous additions. 10/10.
 4) The Yorknew City arc was possibly the most interesting arc of the show and could have been the best one. However I was thoroughly disappointed with the ending. Character development of Kurupika was flawless in this arc and it was a pleasure to see him transform from a partially arrogant and slightly duller character to a cool, calm and deadly fighter. The tension leading towards but I expected to be a huge showdown turned into... well something else? However Chrollo was a fantastic villain and Hisoka's appearance was great. 7/10.
 5) Greed Island was a little...' meh'. After just having been introduced to the concept of 'nen'. I felt it was a little premature to move away from this and focus on a different form of combat involving the playing cards used on Greed Island. The storyline itself I felt was good and flowed nicely from Yorknew but I also felt that the concept of Greed Island was a little too close to the Hunter Exam; with the idea of qualifying and getting through to the end of the exam drawing quite a few parallels with the idea of attempting to win or complete Greed Island. 7/10.
 6) The Chimera Ant arc was for me kinda... inconsistent? The introduction of some of my favourite characters if the show such as Kite, Knuckle, Knov and Ikalgo played a huge part in my enjoyment of the arc and I found many themes very fun to watch. However I felt that in this arc I had already seen enough of Gon and Killua upgrade their nen and I became a little thirsty for action. When this came the overuse of narration and the overanalyses of the fights became annoying. However from the episode in which the palace infiltration began, I was completely back on board and the end was far from the anticlimax problem I had with Yorknew. 8/10.
 7) What a finish. The Hunter election arc was a fantastic way to finish this show. The summary of the other arcs was mixed with a great storyline and a great way to see the characters we had seen in the other arcs. The story had a great mix of action and some pretty interesting politics which I felt really made this arc a good one. 9/10. (Leorio's punch=100000/10)
Overall Hunter X Hunter was a great story of a young boy's adventure and was something that I'm not only really glad I watched but glad I watched first. Praise for HxH and thanks Amanda for the recommendation.",8

                Hunter x Hunter is the Platonic ideal of a great Shönen anime. It's got the same thrilling superhuman action as Dragon Ball Z, the same sense of fun and adventure as Naruto, the same gripping drama as Fullmetal Alchemist, the same existential despair as Evangelion, and the same over-the-top humor as JoJo's. It combines everything about what makes anime great into one cohesive whole, and the worst thing I can really say about it is that it ends.
At first glance, though, it seems like just another Shonen. Gon Freecss is a 12-year-old boy who wants to join the Hunter Association, a kind of martial arts
                  superhero agency with license to go pretty much anywhere in the world, so he can meet his long lost father. He quickly teams up with his three new best friends: Killua, a child runaway from a family of assassins, Kurapika, the sole survivor of a clan wiped out by a gang of villains, and Leorio, a loud-mouthed doofus who just wants to strike it rich. It seems like a fairly standard set-up for this type of anime, but what really makes the series stand out is its unique and captivating cast of characters, its incredible variety, and its refusal to ever play it safe or settle for cliches. 
The bedrock of this series is the ride or die relationship between Gon and Killua. Gon is the archetypical Shonen hero – strong, optimistic, kind-hearted, a bit playful and mischevous – but also hotheaded and quick to run into dangerous situations without thinking. Killua is a cautious antihero longing for redemption. The two complement each other brilliantly – they bicker and argue, as friends of their age often do, but they have a genuine bond that makes them stronger together than they are apart. Gon inspires Killua to fight courageously for the sake of his friends, and Killua reigns in Gon’s more self-destructive impulses. And they both have some truly great moments together as they grow, become stronger, and learn how to survive in the dog-eat-dog world they live in without losing their humanity.
But the world of Hunter x Hunter is huge, and there are many other fascinating characters who get the spotlight. The side characters are often as well developed and interesting as the main cast, and often get their own spotlight episodes where the focus is taken off the main cast entirely. The villains are some of the best in anime: they all have unique backgrounds and motivations, and often team up or fight each other to pursue their own goals. Unfortunately, Hunter x Hunter does suffer the typical Shönen issue of giving its female characters less screen time and occasionally making them wear skimpy outfits for fanservice, but all of them are well-written and usually get their own cool fights and abilities. Also, having gender-diverse characters like Killua's trans sister Alluka or the androgynous Pitou is really awesome, and ended up being some of my favorites in the entire anime.
The art in this series is great, and only gets better as it goes on. The character designs are all memorable and can range from cutesy to goofy to terrifying. The animation really helps sell the most exciting and emotional beats of the story, and also accentuates a lot of the humor. Often, the art style will get incredibly stylized and detailed, helping the viewer feel every moment that much more viscerally. The opening and ending animation sequences are all excellent, and even though they use the same opening song for the entire series, the animation changes enough to make it still feel fresh and exciting.
Studio Madhouse (Death Note, One Punch Man) really knocked this one out of the park, and also brought home an incredible voice cast and musical score. I prefer to watch it in Japanese, as some of the performances towards the end are among the best you'll see in anime, but the English dub is also pretty good if you prefer dubs. The music is also great, and while certain parts of the soundtrack are a bit overused (there's this one bass track that they play in like every episode of the first arc), they eventually sub these tracks out for some fantastic orchestral melodies in the later arcs.
The story of Hunter x Hunter features a ton of great moments, unpredictable plot twists, and phenomenal character moments. It's definitely a slow burn, with 148 episodes in total. But that actually works to the show's benefit, as it allows Hunter x Hunter to tell a wide variety of stories in an ever-expanding world. Every major story arc is different from the last, with drastic changes in setting, characters, style, and tone. My favorite arcs are the Yorknew Arc, in which best boy Kurapika joins the Mafia to get revenge on an elite murder gang, and the Chimera Ant Arc, a 60-episode epic in which humanity must fight monstrous insect creatures for their own survival.
The thing that surprised me the most about this anime is how deceptively dark it is. While it seems very lighthearted at first, with cutesy character designs and swashbuckling background music, the later arcs of Hunter x Hunter are filled with dramatic stakes, moral ambiguity, and existential dread. The series tackles many heady themes – betrayal, revenge, war, genocide, even a fictional version of North Korea – not simply for plot advancement or shock value, but to illustrate how truly evil humans are capable of being, and how hard we must all strive to overcome those dark impulses. The most heartbreaking part is that, despite their superhuman strength and larger-than-life personas, the heroes of Hunter x Hunter are still just children, who sometimes have to overcome obstacles no child should ever have to deal with.
But despite all the convoluted plots and dark moments, Hunter x Hunter is still pure Shonen, and at the end of the day, it has a very Shonen worldview. All the stuff that makes series like My Hero Academia or Demon Slayer great is here too: it’s got tournament arcs and over the top action, but also a belief in perseverance, fighting spirit, and overcoming any obstacles the world may throw at you. In spite of the emotional gut punches this anime throws at the viewer, it still has a largely positive outlook on the world. Even the most terrible monsters are capable of redemption. Even when all hope seems lost, there is a way to succeed and thrive. I found watching Hunter x Hunter to be inspiring, and when that last episode ended, I couldn’t help but get a little misty-eyed as the final notes of “Departure” rang out from my laptop speakers.
There’s still so much I could go on about what makes Hunter x Hunter so amazing, but there is one caveat to this series. It ends. Sort of. The anime series is finished, but the manga is still ongoing. Unfortunately, mangaka Yoshihiro Togashi often has had to put Hunter x Hunter on hiatus due to health issues, which has meant that the famous Dark Continent Arc may never get a full anime adaptation. And while I think the anime ending is a good enough point to wrap up Gon's story, it leaves a ton of plot threads left dangling and character arcs left unresolved. Still, it's pretty amazing to think that after 148 episodes, my biggest complaint about Hunter x Hunter is that there's not more of it for me to watch. 
If you haven’t seen Hunter x Hunter yet and you have even a passing interest in anime or animation as a whole, it’s worth it to check out. The first few episodes are fairly slow-paced, but the series just gets better and better the more you watch it. It’s full of action, adventure, great characters, and a lot of heart. I'm not sure if it's my favorite anime ever, but it's definitely in the top five. I've even been reading the manga so I can catch up to the latest arc, so maybe I'll write a review for that when I finish it in 10 years.",10

                There are a few words that are capable of describing HxH, one of those words is hype. Easily one of the most enjoyable shonens out there.
As a word of warning, some people may consider the first bunch of episodes slow and maybe even not enjoyable, but, while I understand that saying ""watch it until x episodes, it gets better"" is stereotypical, it's completely worth it for HxH.
While the story isn't always told in the best way possible, when it's good, it's great.
The chimera ant arc quite possibly encapsulates all of what makes HxH good and bad at the same time. It'll give you a reason
                  to be excited and it hypes up every encounter to the best of it's ability, and at the same time it'll take a while to get to those parts, way more time than it has any right to. It's very common to have a moment be ruined by having too much dialogue interrupting the action, even when some of my favorite characters were present, they were ruined when it quite literally took a whole episode to explain their abilities, and to rub salt on the open wound, they don't do a good job of explaining these abilities anyways. The common theme is that it will over complicate things that are actually simple to understand. It doesn't happen as much as I might make it sound, but it stands out. But the fights are easily some of the best I've seen and easily make up for any of the short comings, completely enjoyable when the action gets going.",9

                This is one of my personal favorites.
Character development was really good.
This show is like a coming of age type like naruto and one piece. 
The art was decent and subbed version was really good with sound.
The main starts weak and will progress to overcome all opposition the ending of this could have used a little work but the journey was one to be remembered.The main character stays a kid throughout the show but does mentally mature by the end as well.  
Overall this is an amazing anime and if you like naruto then you will love it.
9/10 must watch",9

                 HunterxHunter messed with my mind and heart.
I wasn't very convinced at first, I even put it on-hold for a couple of months. However, once the anime got to a certain point, I realized how into it I was.
The story is intriguing and fascinating. Every arc shows something new, that I can't choose the best one. I sympathized with every character, and learnt every lesson I could take from their experiences.
I congratulate the author for making something as risky as HunterxHunter work in such a beautiful way.
I'll spare you a big analysis on the anime, so you'll have to trust me when I say
                  you won't regret watching HunterxHunter. Definitely!
I only give HxH a 9 because I'm a little mad there aren't more episodes.
It's now one of my favorites.",9
"
                Wonderful ambience and incredible history. Hunter x Hunter gives us a magical universe with very well-written characters and a storyline excellently directed; the animation is fluid and impeccable - which was to be expected, since it was done by MadHouse. The only negative point is the author who never tires of putting this work on hiatus...
The story unfolds at an increasing pace, with the first arc very slow (for the presentation of the characters) and the following more exciting. York Shin is one of the best, he is competent, adult and well formulated. Greed Island is a very average bow... the quality drops and it
                  is more childish, only in the end it becomes more serious. Chimera Ants is shot the best part, bringing a complex plot that explores the ethics and morals of the viewer and the characters. The election arc is a good finish, there is not much to comment on.
Hunter x Hunter is an anime for those looking for something well structured, with a complex story and well-built characters, as well as an exciting storyline. Even though it is a shounen anime, action is not the focus, if you just want to see fighting, go see any other generic shounen anime.",10
"
                I can see why this is some people's favorite anime, but due to personal preferences and some problems with the story the highest score I can give this is a 7. Greed Island is one of the most pointless arcs in anime I've seen. Even some of the Naruto filler arcs are better than Greed Island. That arc in particular felt like a waste of time for me, nothing happened in it, and that was when I noticed the biggest problem with the show. That problem is Gon is a Gary Stu who, while does lose on a rare occasion, always gets what he wants
                  in the end. Every time Gon has a setback it's usually undone, and people in the series give him unnecessary praise he didn't earn because of who his dad is. Even in his most dire moments, he bounces back due to major asspulls. The Chimera Ant arc went on for way too long, and I almost dropped the show because there was too little pay-off vs. time needed to complete the series. My friend convinced me to continue, and after a reasonably short break from the show, I continued and found it enjoyable. 
That being said, there is a lot to enjoy about Hunter X Hunter 2011. The Yorknew Arc is the best arc in the show, and Kurapika is definitely my favorite character. If only he got more screen time, and more story arcs involving him that would have been great. Hisoka and Pariston are great too. My second favorite arc is actually the last one in the show because it had great political intrigue, and made me the most interested in the show since Yorknew. Characters, in general, are really well fleshed out, and the power system is both creative and well thought out. It isn't as broken as others we seen from battle shonen in the past. The more upbeat tone is refreshing if you been enjoying a lot of darker stuff lately. 
The final piece of advice, if you're going to watch this show skip Greed Island, and pace yourself. You'll have a good time with it.",7

If I were to try telling the basic story of Hunter x Hunter to tell a friend about it, I would be at a loss of words after telling them an 11-year-old boy was trying to find his father. Hunter x Hunter is such a complex story that has its own universe created around it by Togashi's creativity and passion that was truly expressed in this show. No one would expect how deep and complex this anime would be based on the description alone. Togashi managed to finally show all of his passion and storytelling into this beautiful storytelling
                  anime.
For something created in 2011, HXH's art was truly ahead of its time. Somehow it managed to have such clean animation and artwork amazing everyone that watched it. The animation could not have been better for this show.
Every single music track picked for this show was amazing. I can not express the amount of thought that was put into choosing every single one. HXH endings are my favorite of all time and have caused many emotions. The soundtracks are also very well known for being so good and have been chosen to perfection. The opening is also very iconic and will become so catchy over time.
If I could give character a higher rating than 10 I absolutely would. Hunter x Hunter has some of the most complex characters that I've ever seen and these characters have related to my ideals more than any other anime. Jumping into this anime thinking it was gonna be some basic shonen my mind was blown away at what developed before my eyes. HXH even allowed for me to somehow sympathize and agree with the ideals of a so thought villain who was supposed to be humanity's enemy. I have seen no better villain throughout my anime career and I doubt one will appear any time soon. The depth and philosophy behind each character mixes your thoughts and thinking if you dive deep in. That is why these characters are beyond perfect.
Hunter x Hunter had everything I ever wanted in a show. Their power system is amazing and allowed for me to enjoy every fight in the show along with the story and development being absolutely amazing.
Overall Hunter x Hunter is a perfect shonen anime in my opinion absolutely breaking the boundaries of so thought shonen and introducing new concepts and ideas for all around. This anime is a masterpiece and deserves the title with all its glory.",10

                Before watching Hunter x Hunter I had seen 2 anime, My Hero Academia and One Punch Man, I watched both based on recommendations. And while I loved both, Hunter x Hunter was the first anime that I truly decided to watch on my own. And i loved it! Hunter x Hunter is the story of Gon Freecs, a young boy who sets out to find his dad who had abandoned Gon as baby so he could become a Hunter, so Gon decides to do the same and the story is about him becoming a Hunter while making friends and learning of the true nature of
                  the world he lives in.  I'm only 14 and I get made fun of for liking anime but I am not ashamed to say that, up until Hunter Hunter I had never truly appreciated a work of art as beautiful as this show. It has the 2 best ""antagonists"" of all time, Hisoka and Meruem. It also contains one of the best friendships in anime between Gon and Killua, these two are the heart and soul of Hunter x Hunter, it is such a joy to see them bond. Also, Hisoka is my favorite anime character of all time, his power is frickin gum and yet he is still the most bad-a gay clown i have ever seen. Overall, I would recommend this anime to anybody. Side Note: I didn't talk about Meruem cause I don't want to spoil anything but he is without a doubt the most perfectly written character in all of anime.",10
"
                Before I watched Hunter X Hunter, the last shounen I completed was DBZ (and that was more than a few years ago) and I'm honestly not a fan of having to watch anime that are more than 50 episodes long, but many people recommended watching this show so I gave it a chance. 
And boy am I glad I gave this shounen a chance. 
Despite its length, I think that this show's strongest features are the variety in the individual arcs as well as the depth the characters are portrayed. I could never really get bored with this show, since it felt like I was
                  watching a different show each the time the arcs shifted. I can be watching a light-hearted story about the journey of a young boy searching for his father and meeting new friends along the way, then later shift to watching a dark sci-fi show about ants devouring people. Along with the variety of arcs, the character development and the relationships between them, allows for the viewer to really ""care"" about them and invest time in getting to know their story and following through how the characters decide to pull through their issues. 
I expected the animation quality to decline after a while, but the animation was spot-on every single episode so I was pleasantly surprised and very impressed that the quality was consistent. The colors are vibrant and the fight scenes play out smoothly for an excellent viewing experience.
Lastly, although the manga is incomplete, the anime ends itself without cutting off at some random point in the show where you feel like you just watched a hundred-some episodes and you're like... what the heck?! It finishes itself off at a point where it feels satisfying to the viewer and most people I think would definitely not feel disappointed after investing themselves in 148 episodes.
Overall, this is probably the most mature and well-written shounen out there. It takes a few episodes to get into it (I had to convince myself to stop cringing at Gon's short shorts), but once you're there you'll be glad you got pulled in. I'm so sad that I can't currently find another anime to replace this hole in my heart after completing Hunter X Hunter.",10

                I can already tell this review is gonna be long. By the way, if you're wondering if this series is worth watching: it is. Don't read the rest of this review because, even though there aren't spoilers, it'll confuse you. But if you want to know if this series is as brilliant as people say it is, then the answer is: 100% yes, and more.
This is hard to review because the manga hasn't finished yet, and I feel like a lot of the things I had issues with during this series are probably justified based on what the rest of this series is likely supposed
                  to be, but we just don't know. So, with that in mind, don't @ me for the things I didn't think were all that great about this series because it still slaps.
First things first, the soundtrack absolutely sucked in the beginning. I'm sure a lot of people found it charming, but I hated it. It got better, though, so I'll digress. The art in this anime is awesome, and the way it's animated can be really intriguing, especially during certain ability activations and stuff like that. Honestly, some of the character designs weren't the best, but once I got used to them, I ended up liking them. Plus, some character designs are badass. Hisoka and Killua alone look so cool.
I'm gonna say some things now that I'm assuming most fans of this series won't like because this show is so beloved. And I get it. I'm a member of that club now, too. However. This series is very confused. And some parts were flat out boring and bad. I understand the ""enjoying the detours"" thing (which is super cool theme for this series, by the way; I love that concept), but this series doesn't present itself like that; it kind of just throws out different arcs that may or may not have something to do with one another and then moves on, and that's really annoying. Not to mention the fact that the characters are also confused. Some have a purpose, some don't; some characters are dynamite and should show up more often and some had too much focus; some antagonists seem more important than others but get less screen time--it's all a bit of a mess. I've seen some opinions on why Killua should be the main character instead of Gon and other, similar sentiments, but Gon being the main character is not the issue I had with the characters. But I'll come back to them later.
Back to my issues with the story or lack thereof. I'm not saying that the Troupe or the Chimera Ants or whatever have to be the only antagonists. I'm not saying this series has to be like Naruto or Bleach or even Gintama. But, I do think it needs some kind of focused plot. If the goal is to have multiple detours along the path of life to enjoy, then have the antagonists be one-offs and never show up again; don't leave room for them to return. Have multiple stories that don't connect--or barely connect--and end it simply, like it began. 
If it's supposed to have an ultimate goal, then make that clearer. Within the first few arcs, say, ""Boom! There's your antagonist. On your way to their demise, enjoy these detours."" But if you're going to do that, the ultimate goal *has* to be referenced throughout the entire series. If Detour A is going to be taken, then it's going to be taken because it's supposed to be a stepping stone toward the ultimate goal. Anything else that happens on that stepping stone is considered a detour to enjoy, but the point of that stepping stone should always be the ultimate goal. And here's the thing: that may be what Hunter x Hunter is. The Troupe, for example, may return as the ultimate antagonist, but we just don't know because the manga is on hiatus (as it should be, given the mangaka's condition).
However, the ultimate goal format doesn't work if the characters don't work in that context 100% of the time, which is how the Hunter x Hunter characters are. Let's get back to why the characters are unfocused. I won't name names because I don't want to have spoilers in this review, but one of the main characters doesn't have a goal at all (until the end, granted), two of them are barely main characters given their screen time (and one of those doesn't have any background work done on them at all), and one of the main characters has a goal that makes it impossible for them to *realistically* get involved in any plotline or any antagonist without it seeming at least a little bit forced.
There are arcs built to include one or two of the main characters, but all of the arcs always exclude at least one character in terms of realistic inclusion. Sure, the character will be present, but it won't make sense as to why. Sure, the plot comes up with a reason, but it isn't a good one. The only exception, I'd say, would be the first two arcs (official arcs, since I guess the actual second one isn't official). It's not that all four main characters have to be there all the time, but the characters that *are* there have to have a good reason to be. Also, Gon is, without a doubt, the central character of this anime. However, I don't know that that was the correct direction to take as the other three main characters are such good characters. Gon embodies a central character, but as Hunter x Hunter doesn't always treat him like one, this should've been an ensemble anime rather than trying to present Gon as an Ichigo or Naruto when, part of the time, he isn't. On top of that, this anime kind of forgets about two of the main characters *a lot,* so it probably should've been about the other two's relationship primarily rather than about all four main characters or just about Gon. Really, the two main characters that are always around should've been co-main characters.
Finally, my last bit of ranting is about the fact that the story and character developments were *way* too inconsistent. Huge events would happen that had zero precedent in the story. Characters would change out of nowhere--and I do mean nowhere--and it would just seem lame and forced. Abilities would be touted as unique, only for the next arc to say, ""Actually, hundreds of people can do this."" I'm gonna slam the stop button pretty suddenly now, though, because it's time to talk about the developments that this anime did amazingly.
The emotional development in this anime was so damn brilliant. Any character at all was allowed to be completely good one moment and completely dark the next. That happened with protagonists and antagonists alike, and it was awesome almost every time. Sometimes the characters actually were both good and dark, and sometimes they just became one extreme for reasons that aligned with the other. Sometimes they would always be one or the other, but their actions just so happened to overlap with the opposite extreme. That variety was so interesting. Killua could be terrifying and sweet and vulnerable and insanely strong all at once. Gon could be earnest and yet awash in rage. Hisoka could attack or help the main characters for exactly the same reason. That is the main thing that kept me hooked to this series.
However, the story did also keep me entranced for most of the time. The battles were almost always phenomenal, whether that was choreography, tone, gore, shock, strategy, victory, or defeat. The emotion and heart of the multiple arcs in this anime always hit the mark, especially when it had to do with the relationships between characters. Certain stories made me wish for more, and certain antagonists made me excited for their return.
The characters themselves, along with their variety of personality, are my favorite part of this anime. I fell in love with all of them, and that's why I stayed engaged when only two or three of the original four characters were on screen. Whether the plot was boring or amazing, whether the pace was terrible or perfect, the characters always kept me coming back because I wanted to be there with them as they fought and struggled and cried and hurt; I wanted to see them laugh and play and learn and love. Who these characters are is so unique, and I'm never going to experience again what I did when I met Gon, Killua, Leorio, Kurapika, and all the other characters--like Hisoka, Ging, and Meruem--that I loved so much.
So, no, Hunter x Hunter isn't perfect. The plot can be slow and long winded; the characters can do things that don't make sense at all; developments can happen that make the story worse rather than better. But all the amazing things about this story vastly overshadow the bad. It shocked me and amazed me more than once, and I hope I'll be able to see its conclusion some day. I'll always be happy and grateful to have spent time with these characters in this world. If you haven't watched this wonderful story yet, believe me: it's a treasure just waiting to be discovered. It's a detour just waiting to be enjoyed to the fullest.",9
"
                Hunter x Hunter (2011) has been my favorite anime for a long time and it still is. Pretty much the entire show was an entertaining watch for me and I personally think it is the best long running shounen out there. Lets get right into the details
First we'll start with the story which I gave an 8. The story premise itself is sort of bland but I forgive that because the manga was done in 1999. What I really based the story rating on was the execution. The anime, in my opinion is paced very well besides the second the last arc in the series.
                  The characters are all introduced fluidly and there's always the overarching plot of Gon trying to find his dad even among the smaller arcs. I think the story is done well, but it's not the strongest point of this anime.
Next we'll look at the art. I gave the art a 9. The only thing keeping me from giving the art a 10 is the first arc of the series. For an anime over 100 episodes, it does an amazing job of keeping a consistently good animation style. That being said, the regular animation isn't any better than Fairy Tail's for example, and I would only give Fairy Tails art a 6. What sets HxH (2011) apart from other long running shounen? It's the pick up of animation in big scene, the use of unique styles and stills that other anime don't use some times. It's the amazingly drawn art in the big fights, and the fluidity of every fight. Simply put, it looks great when it needs to. With other anime, Fairy Tail in particular, the art fluidity of the animation doesn't increase at all even in the big fights except for maybe a few seconds, but in Hunter x Hunter, that level of animation lasts for the whole scene. They also increase the quality in emotional scenes. It's honestly very impressive for such a long show. 
Thirdly we have the sound. I gave the overall sound quality an 8. I think the sound for HxH is pretty good. The music can be very fitting at times, but it also has scenes where it's out of place. There's also one problem I have with the music. There's not a single OST from HxH that I have on my favorite anime music playlist. Basically what I mean is that there's no stand out tracks in HxH that I really like. The opening is good and the endings are great, but the osts in the episode are just average at best. If I was judging just the music in the show, I'd give it maybe a 6. So why is the sound and 8? The voice actors. Holy moly, the voice acting for the sub version of HxH is absolutely amazing, especially the person who voices Gon in the later episodes. Absolutely fantastic. The superior voice acting saves the mediocre sound track.
Next we have characters which I gave a 9. Pretty much any important character in HxH is fleshed out greatly and done well. The best character in the series in my opinion is Killua, followed closely by Hisoka. Killuas progression over the series is honestly heartwarming to watch and he of course has that cool factor about him too. Hisoka is a very unique villain in the series who, while he does have some questionable traits about him to say the least, for the most part he is super well done. Most people say that Gon is the weakest of all the important characters in the series. I disagree. I think people just see Gon's innocent nature and assume that he's too simple. Anyone who actually payed attention to Gon, especially in the Chimera Ant arc would know that he's not as simple as he seems. I won't say anything else to avoid spoiling anyone who hasn't seen the anime yet. Meruem is another great character in the series, in fact, most of the villains of the series are pretty great. The only weak characters in the series are those that don't play a large role to begin with, and that's bound to happen in such a long show. 
Finally we have enjoyment and overall. Since these will be relatively short I bunched them together. I gave both of these perfect 10's. If I was critically reviewing the anime I'd give it a 9/10 however this is based on my opinion. I absolutely loved the anime, the characters, the art, the sound and the story. It's definitely a series best seen by binge watching and not weekly. Like I said, Hunter x Hunter is my favorite anime of all time and it's been that way since 2014. There's no such thing as a perfect anime but if any show deserves to be close to a 10/10 it's Hunter x Hunter (2011)",10
"
                This anime is amazing it`s one of the most unique experiences I`ve ever had with any form of media. It`s one of those shows you wish you could go back in time to wacth it all from the beginning. This review will be spoiler free if you intend to watch the show I suggest you read it.
Story 10:
The story and the worldbuilding of this anime is outstanding all the rules and characteristics of its world are really well wirtten and unique. The story of Hunter x Hunter is devided into arcs that are all different than each other but are all a part of Gon`s
                  journey to find his father. The story just keeps getting better and better each arc. It`s starts of with the Hunter exam arc which is not the best arc of the series but was very great at presenting the world of this anime and its characters and their goals. Then we have the Heaven`s arena arc and then the York new city oh boy oh boy shit gets real in this arc. This is when Hunter x Hunter becomes fucking epic, I`m not going to spoil anything but this is when The Phantom troupe appears one of the major antagonists in the series. I would rank the arcs like this 1- Chimera ants 2- York new city 3- Greed island 4- The hunter exam 5- The 13th hunter chairman election 6- heaven`s arena.
I also wanted to talk about Nen the main power system in Hunter x Hunter it`s one of the most complex and well made power system I`ve ever seen in media.
Art 10:
Hunter x Hunter has by far the best animation of any long running anime. I mean the show is 148 episodes long and the animation just keeps getting better as the series progresses, most long running shows tend to have mediocre animation throughout their run but this is not the case with Hunter x Hunter. Studio Madhouse just nailed the art of the show. The character desingns are also some of my favorites in anime.
Sound 10:
This show`s ending themes are some of my favorites there`s not a single ending song I didn`t love , but my least favorite was the fourth one I thought it was not as good as the others but I still liked it. My favorite is Hiyori ittai the fifth and the sixth ending theme I just fucking love that song. I would rank them like this: 1- 5th and 6th  2- 2nd  3- 3rd  4- 1st  5- 4th
Now lets talk about the openings they all had the same song Departure which I thought was awesome, I never got tired of it, it suited the show so much. The soundracks were fucking amazing nothing else to say.
Character 10:
Probably the anime`s strongest point the characters were all so unique and well written that it`s really hard to choose who your favorite is. My favorite main character was Kurapika he is such a great character. Gon, Killua, Leorio each one of them had a distinctive personnality that you can`t forget about. Now let`s talk about the villains oh the villains there are tons of outstanding villains in this show and I just loved them you could even find yourself liking them because the are so well written that they feel real. My favorite villain was Meruem I wont say why because I don`t want to spoil it to you so you can watch the show yourself.
Enjoyement 10: 
I absolutely adored this anime, I loved every second of it. It was pure awesomness.
Overall:
This anime is a masterpiece that everyone should watch.",10

                There is something about Hunter X Hunter that no one can ever replicate or do better. My favorite anime of all time, really. I do not think I will ever find something I will like as much.
Story: 10/10
It is spot on and some arcs may be less interesting than others but you are always entertained with HxH. Chimera Ant was spectacular and such a unexpected turn when watching it for the first time.
Art: 10/10
The art style is not the best but it grew on me and fell in love with it. Personally I prefer Togashi's artstyle but Madhouse did a great job delivering smooth animation
                  and art with HxH.
Sound/Music: 10/10
Do I really need to expand on this? They kept one song for 148 episodes and I never got sick of it. The OSTs are FIRE as well as the endings. Nothing to complain about really.
Character: 10/10
Multiple characters with various personalities and there was no disappointments in characterizations.
Enjoyment: 10/10
My childhood, very attached to it and will always be! It's amazing.
Overall: 10/10
HxH deserves to be the anime that's on top of every shounen anime, because anything else just does not compare.",10
"
                Disclaimer-ish statement: I base most of my reviews/ratings on how good the characters are rather than almost any other part of the show.
I'm gonna be honest, I'm definitely not the biggest fan of shounen anime, so I didn't enjoy this anime as much as many others will. If you're looking for your kind of average generic shounen anime ever, this is definitely it; however, HxH is so shounen-y with just a bit of originality sprinkled in that it's almost perfect. I base most of my ratings based on what I think the anime is really going for, and as a shounen, HxH performs its job
                  almost perfectly.
Story  9/10
The story follows a young boy named Gon who goes out on an adventure to find his father, Ging. On his way he meets other friends, mainly Kurapika, Leorio, and Killua. Gon has lived on an island his entire life, so he has almost no knowledge of the outside world. He only knows some of it based on visitors to the island and stories that others have told him. When he sets out on his journey, he learns many things, and of course, gets major power boosts on the way allowing him to deal with new enemies. This story also doesn't completely follow Gon, despite him being the main character. In the Chimera Ant arc, the main villain has almost no interaction at all with Gon, the main character. Instead, the anime focuses on something much more realistic, one of the most powerful characters in the series. This makes this anime that much more interesting, as not everything simply rests on the shoulders of the Main Character. 
This anime also really doesn't fall into the whole trap of the endless powering up of the protagonist. Of course Gon and his 3 friends do power up constantly (as life goes), they don't magically power up in the middle of a battle with some bullshit power of friendship.
My only real problem with the plot is the Chimera Ant arc, because it's simply so drawn out. The pace is extremely slow so by episode 50 of the arc, I was basically powering through the last 15ish episodes of the arc. 
Art  8/10
The art is pretty good, nothing really too special. It doesn't really make or break the show, so there's almost nothing to say about it.
Sound  5/10
The Sound is probably the weakest part of the show. The intro tilts me and I hate it, the ost's really aren't anything worth listening to, but the sound effects are decent enough. All the aspects of the sound really get the job done (except the intro) so I'll give the sound a 5.
Character  10/10
The characters in this show are by far the best part of it and is really what's carrying the rating for it.
Gon is a kind of naive boy who is very kind. He has lived on an island his entire life and knows almost nothing about the outside world, but learns quite a bit when he finally ventures out. He has a very strong bond with those around him and will destroy anyone who he loves. He goes through well-paced character development that is actually given a decent reason rather than simply changing his character out of nowhere. 
Killua is Gon's main friend there is definitely an argument that he is the deuteroganist of the anime. Killua is edgy and charismatic, cool and calculated, and is the most popular character in the series. He was raised by a family of assassins who are all extremely cold and harsh. They forced him through endless hours of training while he was a child turning him into a perfect assassin. He now desires simple free time, a relatable motivation that makes the character likable.
Kurapika has a much darker backstory, having his entire clan murdered in the past. He goes through the entire anime attempting to hunt down the perpetrators and collecting the eyes of his dead clan members. He has a single passion that he constantly pursues.
Leorio is attempting to become a doctor to save other people. He is originally shown to be a simple shallow man that only cares about obtaining money, but it is later revealed that he wants to become a doctor to save sick children that can't afford treatment. He doesn't even come close to Gon or Killua when it comes to talent, but he always tries to keep up with them and really cares about them. He even goes as far as punching Ging over an argument about Gon.
The characters of the show are what really make this show one of the best. The villains are all human and most have a somewhat legitimate cause for being a villain. The line between villain and protagonist start to fade and doesn't become as clear, making all the characters really interesting.
Enjoyment  6/10
I really didn't enjoy this too much, but that's only cause I felt like the chimera ant arc was dragged on way too long and I'm not a big fan of shounen, but ultimately, if you're into shounen and stuff, this anime is definitely for you.",9
"
                Hunter x Hunter is the most fascinating story I ever watched , while the show starts out simple as light heart experience  from 4 character that have pretty nothing in common except for the fact that they want to become hunters (some sort of certifiied mercenaries.) all of wich from completly different reasons it slowly progresses to a more mature show. 
But unlikely every other shonen it feels real , it doesn't feel fake or sudden but rather slow and overtime. 
What truly makes this show outstanding are the character the story itself isn't impresive but the character in it make if feel like
                  that.
The show unfortunetly has a realy weak start , NOT A BAD START not to confused with that , just not too impressive the  first 20 episodes or so are just bulding up the core characters and driving forces of the series for the next 100 or so to come separated in 4 unique naritive arcs.
You might get bored in the very begining and the show but trust me this show just gets better and better as you watch more.",10
"
                It took me a long time to get myself to actually watch this anime. I'm not into long anime, and 148 is long for me BUT what convinced me was the amazing soundtrack. The background music really creates stronger impact for scenes. 
Now, 
if you do not like talky animes, where fight scenes consist of a lot of breaks and talking. This may not be for you. BUT the action that does transpire is well worth it. The beauty of Hunter x Hunter is that everything makes sense in the grand scheme of the whole story. It really is a beauty. If you are up
                  for a chatty type anime, I say watch it !",7
"
                bloody amazing. there are no words to convey what an absolute masterpiece this anime is. please watch it, and you will see for yourself. 
the only complaint I have is that the beginning, although still enjoyable, is slower than the rest. the first few episodes (and even the first arc) is not at all a good representation of the rest of the 100+ episodes. many people may give up watching in the beginning before truly getting to experience the full package. I always advise people to watch the first 5 episodes at least before making a judgement as to wether or not they want to
                  continue.
what hunter x hunter has:
-amazingly complex, unique and inteligent storyline
-variety or story arcs that never get boring and always keep you on the edge of your seat
-a perfect mixture of humour, sadness, excitement, tragedy, thought-provoking messages..
-characters that you just fall in love with (yes, even the 'villains')
-super satisfying character development
-breath-taking art throughout
you will not be able to stop watching. and you will only be left wanting more.",10

                There is no greater way to passively generate ""helpful"" clicks for your reviews than dumping on something universally liked (or vice versa). It doesn't matter the quality of the review, as long as you indicate displeasure at the ""pacing"" or the ""character development"" you get a free pass. The inept mind most surely loves their little catchphrases. So I am going to say something controversial AND brave... I reallly really like Hunter x Hunter. I know, whacky opinion right? 
Yoshihiro Togashi is probably a genius. Certainly within the realm of manga he is anyway. The creativity on display within Hunter x Hunter is from my
                  purview of the shounen genre is matched by few. The setting and world, Nen and how all the chess pieces are placed on the board for each arc is glorious. Togashi regularly sacrifices the battle prowess of his MCs in any given arc to allow victory to be harder won through tactics and thought. Killua and Gon are amazingly talented, but they NEED to be because everyone they come up against in their journey is similarly so. That is the primary appeal of Hunter x Hunter. The arcs are distinctly structured and multiphasic and the conclusions are regularly a mix of satisfactions. 
But everyone already knows this anyway... I can't say that Hunter x Hunter is completely my aesthetic and taste and while I think the Ant arc is fantastic and uses it's time wonderfully, it is also too long for my own sensibilities. My personal favourite arc may be yorknew, because Kurapika was the MC we always deserved. Now my only wish is to see the next part of the manga adapted because the following material produced by togashi trounces all before it...",10
"
                Hunter x Hunter is that show for me. You know the one. Always heard of it in passing, seen it mentioned all over the place online, but never quite piqued your interest enough to really dig in, especially considering its size. This summer I finally had a solid week of absolutely nothing to do. So, the logical thing to do? Finish the entirety of an 148 episode anime in that time. Here are my thoughts after thinking on it for awhile.
Story - 8
Strange, right? The story being the weakest aspect? A solid 8 is certainly nothing to scoff at, and let me clarify now. Hunter
                  x Hunter, narritively, is one of my favorite shounen I've ever had the pleasure of watching. It does an excellent job of really making its world feel lived in and keeps things going at a decent pace throughout. The first arc does an excellent job of getting you invested and excited for the story, and it does a good job shifting gears from one arc to the next, whether it be by tone or just content in general.
Decent pace, however, does not a stellar story make. As much as I enjoyed the story overall, there were good chunks where it just felt like my engagement dipped pretty low and things ground to a halt. York New was by far the best overall arc in my opinion, and although those following it weren't terrible by any stretch, they never really surpassed it. If you're familiar with HxH, you already know the worst offender.
The Chimera Ant arc is certainly a divisive one in the community. Some say it's the best of the best and what really puts HxH heads and shoulders above  other series in the genre. And some others say that its pacing is a constant back and forth and tends to drag more than it does excite. I happen to fall into the latter camp. Chimera Ant overall is a neat concept, and I think as it wraps up it has one of the best endings of any arcs in the series. But, for me, the pacing just made me start asking when it'd finally be over moreso than be excited to see the next development.
Greed Island arc also somewhat suffers from this, as a lot of things seem to happen, but it doesn't exactly feel like it's moving forward all that much in a lot of spots, and the finale is very anti climactic and just kind of slides forward into the next thing without much fanfare.
Overall, I definitely loved the story as a complete package, but there were just a few too many moments that felt like they went on a bit too long and dragged down the overall experience.
Art - 9
Although it doesn't necessarily flash its fancier stuff very often, this series still has likely the best consistently strong and appealing visuals of anything I've seen for a series this size. There's next to no moments of things being off model or badly done, and everything feels punchy and detailed, exactly as one would expect from a series like this. When this show really wants to show off though, it does so in spades. The bigger fights in the series had the budget to back them up, and it really shows. 
Sound - 9
This OST is seriously incredible. From the upbeat adventurous fanfares to the menacing quieter pieces, it totally nails the atmosphere in every area. The sound design is also good, although I wouldn't say I'm qualified to really make that judgement. If you ever have the time, just sit down and listen through the soundtrack, you seriously won't regret it. Three thumbs up from me.
Character - 9
This is definitely this series' strongest suit. Every character that is involved with the plot is developed and fleshed out in some way, even some of the more minor characters. The main cast are all exceptionally developed and go through several different phases of shifting priorities, morals, and values. The relationships are strong, the one between Gon and Killua being a complete subversion of the typical protaganist/dueteragonist shonen duo and a welcome one at that. From ally to enemy, side character to primary partner, the characters in this series really shine.
Enjoyment - 9
I feel like it goes without saying at this point, but I had a blast with HxH. There were certainly points where things slowed down, and I'll fully admit there were points where I was outright bored. But the highs were so high they soar above the lowest lows to the point that I can overlook them enough to say the package in its entirety is a joy through and through. Everything works together so well, and the final episodes were a bittersweet farewell, only leaving me hoping for more.
Overall - 9
Hunter x Hunter is seriously an incredible series. It takes the typical shounen tropes and flips most of them on their head, while also doing some things new of its own. The characters are all endearing and memorable, the soundtrack is hands down one of the best of recent memory, and the animation is something to behold and always a joy. Hunter x Hunter is something I'd recommend to just about anybody, even those new to anime as a whole. The size may seem intimidating at first, but it'll slip by faster than you'll expect and leave you craving more. This is a must see for me.",9
"
                I recently finished this show. Now I'd like to review it.
Story: 10/10
This show starts off pretty slow and average, but it really picks up at the end of the first arc and gets astonishingly good when the phantom troupe arc comes along. The characters, that get introduced during this arc, are simply amazing. What seemed like a light-hearted typical shounen, with some subversions, now seemed a lot more serious and intriguing. The following Greed Island arc, was, in my opinion, a lot worse. The villains aren't very good and I didn't really like the setting. This gets overshadowed pretty quickly though, when the chimera ant
                  arc begins. If you're an anime fan, it's very unlikely, that you've never heard of this. The instant change in atmosphere is very apparent, and I love it! The things that happen during this part of the show, are spectacular and it is here, where you really notice, that this isn't a typical shounen. I'm not going to say anything more, since I don't want to spoil anything and I don't want to make this review too long. The arc, that is currently the latest one that was animated, was also really good, but I don't have anything special to say about it.
Art: 9/10
The artstyle in the anime is nothing special, but it is pretty good. The reason I gave this section a 9 is for the animation. The animation is nothing short of  beautiful and, at some points, breathtaking. It is consistently good and deserves a high score.
Sound: 10/10
I don't remember a lot about the soundeffects in this show, but the score is just amazing. It has so many beautiful tracks and it really improves the enjoyment of each scene. There are some tracks, which aren't originals, like Mozart's Lacrimosa, but they do fit the arc it is played in really well, so this doesn't decrease the rating. One other thing I want to mention is, that the track called ""Riot"" is a variation of ""Dies Irae"", also from Mozart's Requiem, which I find really cool!
Character: 10/10
There's a lot of characters in this show, that I have grown to love. There are a lot of great character arcs and the relationships between these characters feel extremely real. These characters make it much easier to watch this show, since you get invested in them really quickly. The other thing I have to say, is that the villains in this show feel like actual characters and not just like obstacles.
Enjoyment: 10/10
I really enjoyed this show. It only took me about 2 weeks to watch all of the 148 episodes, and I felt like it could've gone on for another couple hundreds of episodes. It doesn't feel like a drag at all.
Overall: 10/10
Overall this show is great! It was a very nice experience watching all of it, there's no filler at all and the plot goes from really good to amazing. If you like Anime, I really recommend watching Hunter x Hunter, you're most likely to enjoy it very much.",10
"
                Hunter x Hunter helped me understand something about anime that has really opened my eyes as to how we percieve it. There's a particular aftertaste I get after watching fighers that is really quite bitter-sweet. I couldn't really peg it until now and I can only thank HxH for granting me that clarity. Without muddling myself, I'll first illustrate my point with this example paragraph:
~
 [Shonen anime name] is an anime about a giddy young [boy/teenager/man] named [protagonist 1]. After [being admitted to / revealing to be a member of] an illustrious [group / institution], [protagonist 1] learns of means through which to become stronger;
                  a power called [derived universal power]. [Protagonist 2] is his [rival / best friend] who also seeks to become stronger. He behaves similarly to [protagonist 1] at times, however more commonly demonstrates his [superior/inferior] cool-headedness and intelligence. [protagonist 1] and [protagonist 2] commonly keep up with each other in terms of strength, however possess different talents. Along the way they are acompanied by [serious / greedy [pervert character]] , [strong headed female character] and [useless fan-favorite character/animal]. 
~
You can see what I'm trying to get at here. Having previously watched Fairy Tail , Bleach, BnHA, some dragonball and a few more of the ""big shonen fighty shows"" it suddenly occured to me that practically any character can be pulled from one respective universe and dropped in another with little to no contradictions bar swapping out a few key words. And you have to wonder why that is. I mean, if you look at some of the most popular works both nationally and internationally (Using both this site for a more western view and anikore for a more 'local to the taste' idea) you can tell that some of the most popular works in the field are structured completely differently, portray characters uniquely and tell stories that are far more entangelled. Death Note, Steins Gate, Full Metal Alchemist, Code Geass. These are all shows that reach us because they are (evidently) backed up by the enthusiasm of the fans back in Japan. But therein lies the contradiction. Why then, are shows not encouraged to reach outside the box more if this is the case, if only just a little bit. 
Thats not to say theres no excuse for being a show not being good, or even that you need to reach outside the box TO be good. Perhaps what I see as generic in HxH and other similar shows is just something so common that you wouldn't really think about it. Like how sex scenes are so common in western dramas, and how major characters pretty much have to die in a season finales because ""that makes it good"". But even so the aforementioned thought box is so small for fighting animes compared to what it is for many of the shows we see elsewhere. Every show is obsessed with some form of internalised power, grunting, long drawn out fights, conversations mid punch, naming your moves and above all else QUANTIFICATION. Its like everyone has the same colouring-in book, but different coloured crayons. I suppose you could say the same about the MARVEL franchise but they all openly exist within the same world and come from the same mind(s). There is so little that is truely unique about HxH that it surprises me that it's as highly rated as it is, but at the same time, I can kinda understand why it gets away with alot of it - because it's extremely well refined and some of the areas where artistic merit can actually roam free are actually stellar - most of it anyway.
So, onto actually talking about HxH. Its good.... Most of it. I would say that, in its peaks, this has set a new personal bar for other similar animes, but in its troughs, its a tedious lecture in what not to do. 
The main characters are great, not because they're particularly deep, but because they're just likable. They've done a really good job of emphasising the kind-hearted nature of both Gon and Kilua, as well as they're playfulness, we are constantly shown their metaphorical ability to push against ""the real world"" with their childish optimism, which is exactly what you want in this media centralised around escapism. I'm confident that all this was intentional, but it's just so well done that I can't help but give it due credit. 
Other characters start of cripplingly generic but most of them come into their own after a little while. Some take a little longer to flourish and a small few just flat on their face, however these 'small few' arn't really relevent enough to disturb the (sometimes very very gradual) flow of the story or ruin the overall narrative - they're just very cringy. In regards to the very former catagory, I'll have to give credit to Hisoka for just being really fucking weird all the time, and never really getting boring about it, like so many trope-centric characters tend to do. He's written like a genuine wildcard with no loyalty and it makes him really interesting.
The overall story is Ok. Annoyingly stories in fighting animes don't really try that hard, as they only serve as catalysts for characters to do their thing. There are a few moments that really stand out (like the end of the ant arc, the kind-of-epilogue arc and a good amount of the yorknew auction arc) however there's a significant amount of really generic plot points and mediocre hurdles that just go on and on and on in between these moments. Again, peaks and troughs.
Ok so now I've got one more thing to shit on and one more thing to praise. So lets start with the former, as it applies to more than just HxH. There is a real common trend of time-wasting in anime that was so desperately prevelent in a lot of episodes - especially 86-125. To break down a 22 minute episode: 1 minute recap, 1 mintute intro, 2 minute outro, 1.5 minutes of grunting, 1-3 minutes of further recap, 1-3 minutes of explaining something thats already been explained. Leaving, on average, around 14 minutes of actual new stuff. Like come-on. I get deadlines are tough and conditions can be shit but it really diminishes the viewing experience when its so padded. 
Also, and this is specific to HxH in this case, why does the narrater turn the whole ant arc into an audio book? A chacter would throw a punch and the narrator would go off saying ""he threw a the hardest punch with every last bit of spirit he could muster into being, this was, for all intents and purposes... a mega-punch"". I mean what was the point of even drawing it? I could have had a game open or something if I knew I didn't actually have to watch the fucking thing.
I complain alot as it's only human to, but ultimately a 7 is still a ""watch once and keep an eye on"" on any sensible scale. As I said this anime does an excellent job of refining a tried and tested structure while adding some of its own zest. The flat out best moments in this show lies within its characters (specifically the villains IMO) and how these characters all fall into place come an arcs conclusion. Despite being very traditional in its origin (and in practically in every new arc's start) its amazing just how well the author has implemtented these twists and turns that eventually work to create a really great conclusion wherein I find myself sympathising for the villain in some way.
My score ultimately reflects an average. All elements of this anime flow between a 9 and a 5 on an episode by episode basis (1-19 = 5 , 20 - 85 = 9 , 86 - 125 = 5~ and 126 + = 9).
Not to repeat myself too much but this show is made by its peaks and represented at its worst by its troughs. I highly reccomend you watch this at least once if you're interested. And give it a bit of time to really come into its own. However don't expect anything groundbreaking.",7

                Hxh is a phenomenal shounen that touches multiple philosophical themes. The format from how Togashi started the series towards gon's development throughout the series is amazing. From showing human hypocrisy toward the series it shows gons loss in human morality and meruems gain in human morality. Netero also shows phenomenal execution throughout the series is phenomenal as well. Killua is an amazing side character and kurapikas story and chrollos emptiness parallels are also phenomenal. Hxh makes a new shine for shounen keeping the shounen demographic and format but showing a dee philosophical theme similar to Rurouni Kenshin. The chimera ant arc is a phenomenal top
                  3 shounen arc in my opinion along with love failure and Kyoto. pouf representing human stubbornness and how he respects meruem because what he represents but not who he is is amazing and pitou willingness for meruem is also phenomenal. I love killuas tension and parallels with komugi and his parrelels and tension between illumi. Also, hisoka die hunger seek fr power, and tension with chrollo is executed insanely well hxh is just, in general, an absolutely amazing show. Story: 9 art: 7 sound: 8 character: 8 enjoyment: 9 and overall a solid 8/10",8

                This is going to be My first review on myanimelist, and boy am I going to review a good one. If you don't consider to agree with my opinion, then that's totally fine. This review will try to stay spoiler-free. Also I haven't watched Hunter x Hunter in two years so please consider correcting me on any mistakes I make. 
Story: The genres of HxH are diverse from action, to adventure, psychological, and politics are also involved. Without spoiling too much, Hunter x Hunter is about a young boy called Gon, he was abandoned by his father, Ging. He left Gon at his Aunt's house,
                  Mito. After Gon found out that his father had left him at a very young age, he decides to find his Father, and question as to why did he leave his son to become a hunter. Gon in the beginning of the show is only 12 I believe. This type of story might seem a little childish or simple however as the story progresses it becomes much more complex and intense. I consider the story to be one of HxH strongest points. Most Arcs of HxH are extremely well written and are probably one of the best in the shonen genre. Hunter x Hunter offers some of the most well developed and written characters, engaging stories, and excellent world building. All of this makes the viewer very engaged from my experiences. Togashi is an absolute genius when it comes to writing and what he has accomplished blows my mind. The first arc of HxH may start of as a classic shonen vibe which is not necessarily bad but nothing new or unique. The story might take a couple of episodes to start but in my eyes it's worth it. The first arc is an Hunter exam where applicants take part in the hunter exam. Which is like a classic for a shonen anime. The series can easily shift the tone from light hearted to dark and scary. For example the yorknew arc where the story of Hunter x Hunter really excels and can be considered to be as good as the chimera ant arc. All of the arcs of HxH are connected and this makes it feel like an adventure. The yorknew arc shows the real dangers of the world in Hunter x Hunter and takes a deeper look into thriller. One of the themes of The yorknew arcs is revenge, Kurapika one of the main characters is the main role of this arc. The chimera ant arc of Hunter x Hunter is definitely seinen for it's extremely dark mood, the tone of the story shifts from light hearted and fun to extremely dark from the arc right before it. This arc shows how brutal and dark Hunter x Hunter can be. Gon experiences despair and emotions in this arc like he has never done before. This arc also shows some of the best narrative storytelling and character development shonen anime has ever seen. Togashi also has foreshadowed many events (which if I explain would be considered spoilers but they are incredible.) Another thing so great about HxH is how togashi observes a typical shonen anime and then takes his own unique formula upon it. . What I mean by this is is take for example the main character of Hunter x Hunter, Gon. If you take a look at many other shonen anime main protagonist, i'm just going to name a few. Goku, Naruto, Luffy, Natsu, Ichigo, they all have some type of powers gifted to them or some sort of special ability. Goku was born as a powerful saiyan, Luffy has the devil fruit powers, Naruto has the nine tails chakra, and his father was extremely talented, also his mother was a jinchuriki. Natsu was the son of a dragon. Ichigo had supernatural powers, the writers wanted these heroes to be able to start winning from episode one. but if you take a look at Gon, he is a somewhat normal 12 year old at least in the shonen genre, he isn't gifted with powers or neither he was given some, but he still excels in strength, speed, and stamina, he's just not given any powers. Normally a shonen protagonist would usually win 90% of the times but in Gon's case he most likely only wins 50% of the time. Gon doesn't have to be the strongest character in Hunter x Hunter and he definitely isn't. Gon isn't trying to change the world for the better or to save the world, he's just a normal boy. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with that. There are moments when Gon feels sad or scared. He isn't always the bright protagonist and having a right mindset throughout the series. This is especially evident in the Chimera ant arc. But through all of this we see Gon trying to tackle problems in his own unique way. Gon doesn't need to win all the time which 90% of other shonen animes do. The story is trying tell you about friendship and the characters, the journey which gon takes, but also about loss, despair, pain, and how cruel and brutal the world can be. It also goes on to show how not everyone is perfect and people have their breaking points which is shown in Gon in the later part of the show. Because of this it makes you question whether gon is good or bad. Power-Ups which are because of will-power are not existing in the world of Hunter x Hunter.  Another deconstruction is the standard you lose, then you train, and then you win, while there is training in Hunter x Hunter, the outcome doesn't always lead to victory, The training is there to further explore into the power system of Hunter x Hunter and improving the skill of the characters which brings me to the next point of Hunter x Hunter, which I included in the story, the power system, Nen. I consider Hunter x Hunter to have the BEST power system in all of anime, because of many reasons. The way togashi formulated the Nen system avoids many problems in shonen anime. I'm going to take chakra as an example. A person who has higher chakra beats someone with lower chakra. the only exception is the eight gates. In Naruto this can only be avoided to a certain extent, if you have a special jutsu. But the problem with this is the author starts contriving 'secret techniques'. But this is basically just a power boost and doesn't make much sense, it's lazy writing. Because of this there is no sensible or reasonable way in order to beat someone with higher chakra. Because of this the hero just ends up becoming overpowered. However the case is different with Nen, With Nen there are restrictions placed. Nen restrictions mean that you can increase your Nen power but there would be constraints. For example if i'm put a restriction, where I'll be able to run twice as fast on a specific day but on the other days I would be twice as slow. So if your condition is stricter then your nen power would increase. The nen system is completely unique to each person even when divided into 6 sub-parts. Having more or less nen power doesn't exactly make you the winner. One part of Nen which is interesting is the user has to consciously concentrate the outputs towards different parts of the body. Nen could be used to strengthen the body, use it as a shield, or use it as some other feature. Even throughout battle you would have to be conscious about controlling your power and switching between offense and defense, misreading the opponent would be fatal even if you have more nen. Nen perfectly demonstrates characterization and progression. If we take a deeper look into the 6 nen types which are Enhancement, transmutation, conjuration, specialization, Manipulation, and emmision. Enhancements for example, Gon is simple and finds thrill in fighting, his move jan-jan-ken which is where he either uses a rock, a paper, or scissors, this reflects gon's personality. This makes fights in hunter x hunter even more enjoyable and unpredictable.This is a summary of Nen but more could be explained, there are many videos on youtube which you can view. Hunter x Hunter also has topnotch world building, Gon and killua visit different countries, each area has a distinct setting, even a country representing the state of North-Korea, the world building may not be as extensive as say one piece, but every place they visit contributes to the plot. One thing about HxH world building which could be explained more is to how gon and killua are able to run really fast and run at supersonic speeds but Normal humans don't seem to be able to even run close to as fast as Gon and killua to. That's just my complaint interms of storybuilding. I guess this is enough for story, let's move to animation/Art. 
Art/Animation: Hunter x Hunter has spectacular art, for a long running shonen series, while it isn't ufotable quality animation or kyoto animation. madhouse studios produces consistent animation for the entirety of hunter x hunter the animation/art does not suffer and does not downgrade. The fight scenes in Hunter x Hunter are a joy to watch and the choreography works well, the camera movement is good, and shots are framed well. Key frames are extremely accurate and overall it's definitely 9/10. Thankfully madhouse studios has been in the business for years and they had talented staff members working for Hunter x Hunter. I don't really have much to say in terms of animation and art other then really good, but the animation was good when it really needed to be, which was during fights and other important scenes. Animation during parts with heavy dialogue were still good but wouldn't say it to be as impressive as the fights.
Sound/ost: Hunter x Hunter for the sound effects was spot-on for the entirety of the show. Hunter x Hunter's ost started of decent, but as the story progressed it became much better especially during the chimera ant arc. The ost's for the most part perfectly fit to the scene shown. Fight scenes would usually have ost's which match the scene as well as emotional scenes, there really isn't much to complain in terms of sound and soundtracks for Hunter x Hunter. Voice actors for the most part were impressive with exceptions for a few characters. I would prefer the sub over the dub, the sub feels much better than the dub and the sub has some impressive scenes. Overall it definitely deserves a 9/10 for me. 
Characters: Hunter x Hunter's characters rival it's story writing and it has an exceptional cast. Togashi knows how to develop and write a character, the villains of Hunter x Hunter are exceptional and some of the best as well, which I would explain later. Hunter x Hunter starts with four main characters, Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio. These characters are interesting and they are well written, Gon, killua, and Kurapika all have excellent character development. Killua has an interesting backstory and so does Kurapika, however nothing much is revealed about Leorio and he gets the least screen time amongst these four. Throughout the series you are introduced to a wide range of characters who all are diverse and have different personalities, no two characters feel the same. Gon may seem like a typical shonen protagonist but as the story progresses he starts to do things which may seem not so hero like, and Gon isn't there to always save someone, he does help someone if it interests or benefits him, Killua develops as a character from being a cold-killing assassin to finding his self-worth. Kurapika is ought to seek revenge from the phantoum troupe because of the murder of his clan. Now onto the villians, the villians in HxH are some of the greatest villians in anime, no two villains would feel like the same and are distinct from one another. and one of the greatest villian groups, the Phantoum Troupe. These villains are highly skilled and they feel like a team, what I mean by that is they care for one another, unlike other shows where if you're weak i'm going to kill you. It goes on to show you how human the phantoum troupe is, they share similar philosophies. This shows that the phantoum troupe are people, and are not evil just because they are, it's how they're living their life. In HxH no person is 100% bad and certainly no person is 100 percent good either, this creates a grey line between good and bad, it's not about a hero saving the day rather a journey for Gon. The Chimera ant arc also features some excellent characters such as Meruem, Meruem is a rather complex character, since he was born he was known as the ant king. But his character develops in a sense of not as a king but as an individual with his own purpose, something beyond world dominance. His character development was slow and gradual. This made it convincing. There's more to him to explain but that would be considered as spoilers. Komugi is also introduced as a character who interacts with meruem, It also takes a deeper look into Netero, the hunter chairman. And explains his character. Many other cast of characters are also there with interesting personalities.Overall the characters of Hunter x Hunter definitely deserve 10/10 
There are some thing in which the 2011 anime adaptation from Madhouse failed to do and could be improved upon, the first couple of episodes are definitely hard to get into, the tone seems extremely light and childish, but it improves over the course of many episodes, If you're going to watch Hunter x Hunter for intense fights and amazing action then you're kind of in the wrong place, while Hunter x Hunter does have some intense fights and many of them actually, it's more of the thinking and strategic fights over the only physical strength. You would be left disappointed if you consider Hunter x Hunter to have fights like Dragon ball Z. That's not how fights are done in Hunter x Hunter. The chimera ant arc also has some flaws, generally the pacing from episode 89-98 is somewhat poor, and episode 115 also has poor pacing, overall the pacing of the chimera ant arc is relatively slow but it pays off in the end. Togashi's writing during the middle of the Chimera ant arc is poorly paced, other than that the arc is one of the best anime has to offer. Some people may not like the chimera ant arc due to the pacing and how the episodes are narrative heavy but in the end it's what suits your taste. In episode 111 where the Climax of the chimera ant arc happens, you would think for it to be action heavy but it's more of a psychological path. That doesn't mean it's bad, spectacular fights still happen but not as much as you would think. But after episode 118 narration slowly decreases and episodes return to 'normal'. If you're not into the narrative method. Hunter x Hunter may not be for everyone and every show should be judged on your opinion, I would consider Hunter x Hunter to be one of the greatest shows of all time. 
Overall I would consider this to be one of the greatest shows and togashi is an absolute genius for creating this masterpiece of a show.

                Hunter x Hunter was one of the best plot wise shows I have ever seen. It was a masterpiece that led us on the life of Gon Freecs as he went on an adventure to find his father. I'm really glad that they remade this anime in the 2011 version, it was a huge upgrade in art from the last one.
The story itself is simply amazing yet also easy to follow. It gets your wrapped into its plot and holds you there keeping you from leaving and wanting more and more until your finished. It had some incredible and crazy plot twists and just when
                  you think his journey couldn't get any more crazy, something tops it. It also gives you a good look at the world he lives in and how much people like the hunters and even regular people could do and what is possible in turn leading to even more content for this show. At the end they haven't even explored the dark continent which I am hoping they use to make Hunter x Hunter season two.
Obviously the art has been improved greatly off of the original show. It was nice to see the show in more vibrant and beautiful colors, pulling me in more.
The soundtrack is well known and has enhanced the anime to even greater heights. I really couldn't find anything wrong with the sound in this show (thank god they improved it from the last show).
The character development in this anime blew me away. Gons whole character was very well defined, as well as his best friend Killua Zoldyck. They went into every detail about their lives and also had very enjoyable characters in this show. They all had different and very unique personalities and made every character extremely enjoyable to watch and pay attention to.
I'm not going to lie it was really hard to not watch this anime it was so enjoyable. Every episode had me wanting to watch the next one regardless of the consequences. All of the sound, art, characters, and especially the plot made this anime enjoyable. Definitely one of my favorite shows to watch.
Overall it was a masterpiece and I can only pray that they make a second season and it is just as great and fulfills all of our hopes for it.
I highly recommend this anime to ANYONE.",10

                Despite Hunter x Hunter's incredible success as a manga and renewed popularity with it's 2011 reboot, I only found out about this series through one of the people I follow on my tumblr account almost 2 years ago now. Said person was a huge fan of the character Hisoka and after seeing her enjoy the series for multiple months, I sat myself down last spring and watched the first episode. And then continued to binge the remaining 147 episodes within the week.
And yeah just a heads up, it's kind of long. However, if you start watching the show and enjoy it as much as I
                  did, then hopefully that won't be a huge problem.
Glancing at HxH from afar, the story may seem like 20 different plot lines all jumbled together into a big mess. In reality, each arc fits perfectly and makes sense regarding the circumstances the characters are in at that certain point (Don't worry, I'll keep this spoiler free!). The main story, however, is pretty simple; 12-year-old Gon Freecs ventures off of his home island to take a test known as the Hunter Exam to (you guessed it) become a Hunter and eventually find his father, who abandoned him as a young child. If written by anybody else, this show could have been a huge flop, but because Togashi knows what he's doing, he was able to create a well-paced* series filled with wonderful characters, a fully-fleshed out world, and a story that will always keep you excited for what's coming next.
*My only dislike regarding the story was certain parts of the Chimera Ant arc, starting at around episode 76. The pacing at the climax of the arc slows down a lot, and it may make you want to stop watching. But place your trust in this series and keep going (there's no rush anyways); at the very least make it to episode 131.
As for the art of the series, the animators do a beautiful thing to the young main characters- slowly age them. It's such a slight and gradual change, you won't even realize it until you rewatch the beginning and see the contrast. Along with the characters, the general coloring of the show changes as well, going from a bright and colorful exam/tournament arena, to a more relaxed city atmosphere shining with the building's lights, to a dark and dangerous forest with the only light coming from the moon. The bright and more saturated colors do return near the end, but even then it's not quite the same as it was in the beginning, just like the characters. Also, just a shoutout for Studio Madhouse's animation team for constantly making the show look quality and even raising the level of quality as the story progresses!
Hunter x Hunter's soundtrack has a habit of repeating songs, but for good reason. The music does a great job to help amplify the intended emotion for the scene: if the audience is supposed to be scared of a character/event, the music will blast louder and louder with a mess of brass chords to show the disorder of the situation. If the audience is supposed to be sad over a character, then the music will be as soft and gentle as we wish the writers were with our favorite character. The music isn't 10/10 on it's own (more like 8/10), but I'll be damned if it doesn't do a great job to set the tone of the episodes.
For the characters I'll mostly be discussing Gon and Killua, who isn't introduced until episode 3. It's not a spoiler, but a majority of the series is dependent and thrives off of Gon and Killua's friendship.
Many fans of the series would say that Togashi wrote HxH to be a deconstruction of the shonen genre, and I believe that this can be seen the most easily with the characters. Gon Freecs, at the start, is the stereotypical shonen protagonist; determined, full of energy, full of dreams. Togashi uses this innocent type of character to initially draw his audience in, and then throws anything and everything at this kid until we see a darker side of Gon appear. The opposite is with Killua, starting off as a mix of angst and childishness with not-the-best morals and eventually changes to become a person with goals, dreams, and a constant source of happiness. Throughout the 148 episodes, the audience sees these two immediately bond and grow even closer, until the appearance of their new personality traits cause friction. That's all I can really say about that without going into spoilers, so let's move onto the ""antagonists"". Everyone loves humanized villains, right? I hope so, because HxH does a superb job of giving the audience enough glimpses of the villain(s) for us to determine that they're evil, and then show us situations where these ""villains"" are actually different from what we thought. Except Hisoka. I still don't even know what's up with him.
If someone were to ask me how much I like this series, I would tell them that the last time I was so passionate about a show, it was when I watched Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) and I was moving deeper into the anime community, moving from magical girl show into deeper, more complex shows. Basically, I love this series. Despite the pacing sometimes making me want to rip my hair out and seeing my favorite characters get hurt, I absolutely enjoyed watching this show. I wish I could forget that I had watched it, just so I could watch it again (which I plan on doing within the the next few weeks). Although I wish it were more popular, I believe that HxH can be as memorable as other shows like FMA. And with the manga now finally releasing new chapters, I hope to god that one day there may be another season of HxH.
TL;DR : Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a beautifully written, well animated piece of work that accurately portrays youth characters and villains as flexible characters rather than archetypes with some great songs to match.",9

                You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want.-Ging Freecss
damn, this shounen hit me hard. this certainly stands out from most shounen out there. This young boy was just trying to become a hunter while finding his father pretty easy to do. Damn, it went through incredibly deep and complex from time to time. Likable characters I thought friendship animes were just boring but damn hxh gives a different vibe. Every arc was pretty good the way they introduce was good. The one that stands really amazes me was how an unbelievable
                  antagonist because at first, you thought he was an average antagonist but damn. Through 64 episode haft, I think you can clearly see he was born to be a king but fights over what he truly is. As you can see meruem thought that he was only purpose was only a king to rule over the world but a one-person change the way he sees things this girl name is Komugi is a girl who is master at gungi.The moment when meruem ask komugi name was the moment when the king change forever. In the end, their relationship was beautiful from playing a simple game the two became close to anyone in the whole series.
Overall watch this masterpiece Im truly glad that i have the privilege to watch this wonderful anime. This is one of the best shounen series out there.",10
"
                What an anime! I wasn't a big fan of the shounen genre but HxH has changed my views on it. It has shown me that not all shounen rely on big fight scenes with crazy powerups and that shounen protagonists can be complex. I am now more open to this genre.
The characters, the soundtrack and the story is what I appreciate the most in a series, and HxH nails the spot with all of them. The cast is diverse and deep. Many characters, no matter how small, have a personality and a goal. A lot of characters have the spotlight put on them and the
                  story reaches a point where you could say it has multiple protagonists. You could say that even the antagonists become protagonists. By the way the antagonists are brilliant, definetly in my top favourites.
At first glance the plot doesn't seem that interesting; just a boy looking to become a hunter and find his father. You couldn't be more wrong. The story becomes more interesting and complex with each arc. Speaking of arcs, they're quite diverse. Every arc feels different and I think this is a good thing for the most part. You may not like all the arcs but you have to appreciate the fact that they're not all the same.
With that said, there are some things I didn't like about HxH. I've mentioned that the cast is diverse but the bad side is that a lot of characters are introduced every arc and not all of them are interesting or complex. It's hard to care about the story when the characters don't mean anything to you.
Some decisions or ""asspulls"" in the story are another part that I dislike about the anime. I can't talk about this too much without giving spoilers. These problems didn't affect the overall experience though.
I also want to mention Nen. HxH's ""power system"" is genius. It's so volatile that the possibilities are endless. Every fight is entertaining and unpredictable as a result. 
I'm giving it a 9/10 for now but it has the potential to become a 10 when the story gets finished. By the way if you decide to watch it prepare yourselves because the hiatus is strong. Stonger than it has ever been.",9
"
                I feel ashamed by those who dislike this show. I can't say much because I haven't watched that many anime, but I think Hunter x Hunter is the greatest anime of all time! Fantastic characters, fantastic development, and a compelling story. These are the three characteristics of Hunter x Hunter that make it the masterpiece it is. Even some of the worst characters presented in the show are still a little bit enjoyable to me and are far more superior than some of the worst characters in shows lets say Naruto (Sakura, bleh!). Speaking of enjoyability, I watched the first two arcs in just a
                  day, and it was worth it. Give it try. 10/10",10
"
                This anime was a journey and although I don't enjoy the chimera ant arc, I still think its a 9/10 because of how everything works so well, I love the characters (not in chimera ant) the music is phenomenal, the world, and it has one of the best moments in anime period. This anime is a must, just know with the chimera ant arc it's hard to get through but there are still key moments that make it bearable. I know the narrator is annoying, I know the story is going off the rails again, but pls don't drop it I believe in you. MAKE
                  IT THROUGH CHIMERA ARC. but yea if the chimera arc was better thought out this anime would be a 10/10 for me.",9

------
review done after re-watch
✦Story
Hunter X Hunter story is something I would call beautiful and powerful. It's battle shounen Anime with a great value of characters. The growth of characters, the adventure, the emotions and it's deliverance was absolutely beautiful. I felt this was a great enjoyment story-wise. A boy who aims to find his father and in process of that he meets great friends, worst enemies, many lessons of various aspects of life, death battle. Of course story'wise quite a bunch of other characters also get attention
                  which allows you to grow into them.
Cannot really say much else without spoiling anything, think main point is that the growth and emotional value is stunning in this series.
Even though last arc of the Anime was quite slow paced, but when I first watched it, It felt tense, spot on. It was suppose to be tense and have slow build-up. It gave a very strong emotion and value to the characters, their relationships the enemies and the battles that came along. Giving us absolutely powerful finale. Whilst re-watching I didn't feel that tension as much and rather felt simply that the episodes were dragged on. But thats the effect of rewatch. 
Although, I cannot give it perfect score, as throughout the series I felt that something was ""off"" to my taste. Couldn't figure out what, but that lowered my rating a bit.
✦Art & Sound
Stunning yet simple art, absolutely great effects that came with battle sequence deliverance. Plus it had a bunch of moments where they made artistic scene or an image. Some of the facial expressions were truly powerful. So Art'wise I cannot complain.
Now as for music, to be honest I wasn't fond of opening songs and so, they felt too adventurous, hype and ""boy'ish"" for me, they weren't bad, just not my cup of tea. Aside that the OST itself was splendid. Especially some of the ""epic battle music"" tracks and few a bid mod mysterious and unique tracks.
✦Character
Well, this paragraph is impossible to review. There were many characters with more than one dimension to their character. Lot you could love, hate, of course plenty of cannon fodder as well, but point stays.
I'm going to only comment the main character himself. Gon, Gon is an adventurous kid with a strong sense of justice, morality and value. And such things come with great deal of stubbornness. He isn't exactly the intelligence type of character, but rather he is more a ""heart"" person. Meaning that his values are in correct direction, where lot of ""excuses, debating etc.."" are simply irrelevant. As the core of the thought remains, no reasoning can change those. In a sense in more of a cheesy way of saying ""He is an strong sun, that warms and illuminates everyone around him.""
✦Enjoyment & Overall
There were few little nitpick of an issues that won't affect the score. But something felt ""off"" for me, thus why I cannot give it perfect score. I cannot explain what it is, but it simply felt so. In the end, when I watched this Anime the first time, I absolutely enjoyed, now that I marathon re-watched it. I can still say it's one of the best battle shounens out there. Although this one here is a bit darker and deeper battle shounens than the ones we are used to.
I wanted to add it to favorites, but no, it's something I really enjoyed, but simply cannot ""favorite"" it.",9
"
                this anime was very good. I just caught up to the end and sadly I have to say I am disappointed with the slowing down once the chimera ants showed up and the sudden end to the series. the charictors are well shown however it would be great if we see some of the charictors in the beginning towards the end. and the missing later episodes are missed because of the ending screen on episode 148 almost for-shadowing a new season but its been three years and almost all hope of that happening has ben crushed. overall I have to say that this is definetaly
                  better than the 1999 version but definetaly needs more episodes especaily from what we get on the last episode.",10
"
                As much as I love this anime I’ll have to admit that chimera ant arc is so fucking overrated. The arc is so slow paced and it doesn’t let you enjoy the anime. Leo and Kurapika are basically irrelevant to the entire anime at this point. I wanted to love this anime and give it a 10 because I never heard anything bad about the anime and the arc that I find the most annoying is the one that people loved the most. I would have given it a 10 but because the bulk of the anime is chimera ant arc, I’ll have to give
                  it a 8.5. It took me less than 3 days to reach ep. 75 and now it’s taking me over 2 months to get to ep 120. That’s how slow paced at arc it is.",8
"
                  I wanted my first review to be something special, so here we are: my favorite anime of all time. Let's get this show on the road.
  Story:
The plot of the show starts very simply, and the world is small as well, mirroring Gon's own perspective. As Gon's worldview expands, so does the amount of detail in the world around him. We learn about different families, groups, cities, and countries while Gon is on the hunt for his father. Eventually, we learn just how vast the world really is, and how small Gon is in comparison. In a show like this, I appreciate
                  it being shown just how much room to grow a character has. From early on, it is shown that he has incredible potential, yet always reminds us that he has a ways to go before he comes close to reaching it.
  Art:
The character designs are iconic and easily recognizable. You can usually take a still frame from an episode and get a good grasp on the personality of a character. As someone who is at least somewhat experienced in drawing, I can tell you how difficult that is.
  Sound:
The soundtrack for this anime is easily one of the most iconic in anime history. It's astounding how often I hear the OST in memes from outside the anime community. That aside, the music has an incredible atmosphere that accents so many moments from the anime wonderfully. There are so many times where the music adds so much emotion to a scene, and also times where the choice to leave out music adds just as much. This includes the endings, I have cried while listening to the build up of Hyori Ittai.
  Originality:
The originality of this show is incredible, and that originality is mainly derived from the power system: Nen. This power system has a set of rules that are upheld, and the author even gave himself an out to write in any cool powers he thought of that didn't fit into any category in the form of Specialist. This means that he can really write any power he thinks of, as long as he can come up with a reasonable condition for use. This is what we call a ""big brain move."" As a result, the fights between Nen users are incredibly interesting to watch pretty much every single time.
  Characters:
I already said they are iconic, but I would also like to say that the characters are distinctly human. Everyone has flaws, boons, aspirations, and motivations. Enemies feel humanized instead of demonized. This is something I feel is distinct to Hunter x Hunter. I can't think of another shounen that would go into the backstory of a minor character whose only purpose was a training montage.
  Overall:
I want to once again say that this is my favorite anime of all time, and that this is also my first review. I know that this show is from 2011, and I am writing this in 2020, but this had to be my first review, even if it's a poorly written one. I just want to finish this off by saying that if you do not like this show, you are factually incorrect <3",10
"
                I completed this anime a year ago but I joined today in MAL that's why I writing the review today. 
This anime looks boring as it starts but you cannot stop watching after its main component comes into play. 
This anime is full of action and wisdom of every character even if he/she is a villain. 
And for the animation I think I just have to say ""Mad House 😊""
You cannot hate anyone in this series and no character is overshadowed by other character. It is a long series so most of you are still thinking to start it but it's okay. Take your time
                  and believe me after completion of this anime you will feel so blessed that you got a chance to watch an anime this amazing 😁✌️. Best of luck and be safe",10
"
                I gave it a 7 but i was about to give it a 5 but its not mediocre. I'm sorry for the hunter fans but i'm going to get strait to the point why i gave it a 7. Lets talk about story i gave it a 6 its good and all but most of the arcs are talk no b*llsh*t like i mean for example the chimera ant arc most of it was talking not fight i want it half half but most of the time they talk about some BS that's irrelevant to the story and yeah its just not that great. The
                  art style its outstanding there's nothing really to talk about other than the fact that the fight scenes were too shot most of the time they don't even hit their shots. Sound... Nothing to talk about. Character's... . Ging's a debut, kurapika is pointless i don't like his egdyness, lerorio isdecent and gon and killuia are best characters of the anime and the phantom troupre are disposable characters, and the rest are irrelevant. Enjoyment 5 because most of the arcs are boring as hell like i skimmed through them. Overall 7 Its good sorry hunter hunter fans but i don't think i can give it more than that. And hunter hunter will probobly never continue because of the writers condition even though he said it himself. That my review",7

                I give it a 10 out of ten because its good I love it so like I im like still watching it still but not waching it so on hold its good i hope other people love anime maybe i can tell people or my bff on roblox idk how to do it but i guess ill try hard idk maybe  so this is my preview or something and i thinks its good righting so you know that your like it or not just saying good anime could watch more but i cant tell anybody that im gonna watch a cool anime or i

                This series would have been a 10 in my list is it wasn't for leaving out my favorite character out of the complete Ant saga. 
But overall:
The story took me in from the beginning. A great serie with a lot of interesting characters  (and of course the very intersting Zoldyck family) and a lot of fighting which i like :)
My bf compaired it a bit to DBZ, another series we love ;) If has a bit of the same feeling altho in my opinion the only comparison is the fact that everybody wants to become stronger and stronger :) 
Special notice of my favorite
                  character of the serie: Hisoka 
He's BadAss! Not only became my favorite char in the series but amost my fav char of all time (can't beat Vegeta yet tho ;))
Some people complaining he a pedofile homo gay lord clown blabla. But i don't agree. He is a very cleaver person and a genius when it comes to fighting... And yea maybe he  might look a bit creepy cus he is turned on by great fighters in the making... doesn't make him a pedophile in my opinion tho ;) More like a saiyan with personality issues... But the way he lives for, and loves to fight, and also giving potentially great fighters a chance to blossom (so he can beat the shit ouf of them) makes him both magnificent an terrifying at the same time!  I think he is the best of the best and i really love him in this series! Was sad to see so little of him after the Hunter island saga..  
I still have to watch the HxH movies. Looking forward to them :)",9
"
                The number of times I have skipped over HunterxHunter when it was recommended to me was my first mistake. I wish I would have watched this much sooner. I was intimidated by how long the series went on for but now I only wish that it would've continued.
I want to watch this for the first time again, however, rewatching it brings me so much joy. The characters are unique and complex all while being relatable in some form or another. This was one of the first Animes I have seen that has hooked me since the first episode.
With the series popularity, I have been able
                  to make so many new friends and share our love and appreciation for this show. I know this is cheesy but, now I have my own little group just like Gon, Killlua, Kurapika, and Leorio. 
I can still feel the butterflies in my stomach, please if you have time, watch this! If you don't end up liking it that's cool! I hope you can find an Anime that makes you feel the same way I do about HunterxHunter. 
Thanks for reading my review! <3

                My favourite anime. There's honestly nothing bad I can say about this show, let me analyze how I see this anime and how I felt watching it....
Story:
Without getting into to much detail, the story differs from a lot of anime. I love how a show can be so happy and uplifting while being a serious fighting anime. At first, I didn't want to watch HxH because it was 148EP long, but oh my gosh was it worth it, I already loved the story when watching it but now looking back at it I get so much nostalgia and I didn't even watch it that long
                  ago. 
10/10
Soundtrack: 
One of the best I've ever heard. Its absolutely beautiful. Theres Joyful OST's, Epic OST""s, Sad OST's, Weird (In a good way) OST's, you name it. The OST's plays a big part as to why this anime is so amazing and why I get nostalgic feelings looking back at it. 
10/10
Art: 
What do I have say? MadHouse is one of the best company's out there, If you've seen there other work before, you already know how good the animation is, especially for 2011 when animation wasn't as high quality as it is today. 
9/10
Character:
Gon, he's happy go lucky! when you first meet him, and you might think he's just a generic ""I won't give up!"" kind of boy, but trust me he's not. This anime has to have the best development for the characters in the show. They even had Leorio, who grew to be more of a minor character over time get character development. The development in these characters is why their some of my favorites of all time. 
10/10
Enjoyment: 
I'm pretty sure all you guys know how much I enjoyed this anime when I watched it based on what your reading right now!
10/10
Overall: 10/10
I highly recommend you watch this anime, it doesn't matter if you love Romance, Shounen, Comedy or anything! Either way you will love it. I'm not over-hyping it, I'm being realistic!!",10

                I recently finished watching all 148 episodes of the anime Hunter x Hunter. I’ve watched a lot of anime in my life, and I have to say that I have never enjoyed an anime more than Hunter x Hunter.   
The anime is incredibly fun to watch: the adventures are dazzling, the characters are so well-written, the animation is spot-on, and there are so many surprises—it’s not easy to know how a particular story will unfold or resolve, and the suspense makes you want to watch more and more. 
The friendship between Gon and Killua is the most beautifully developed anime friendship I’ve ever
                  seen. The friendship is by no means perfect (there are miscommunications that are so painful to witness because you want both of them to be happy), but that’s what makes the friendship so real and relateable. For Killua especially, he grows so much throughout the story and the way he’s able to overcome so many obstacles and save his friends despite his troubled upbringing is so incredible to watch. Killua has become my favorite character ever, period. 
Since I’ve been home most of the time due to the pandemic, I can’t go on physical adventures, but the adventures I’ve watched in Hunter x Hunter have been just as enjoyable. This anime, especially the characters, and especially Killua and Gon, will always have a special place in my heart.",10

                HunterxHunter is an anime that ""deconstructs"" well the genre Shounen, Togashi well managed  to make a world full of limitations so that the solution of things did not arise as a magic pass or with power of friendship
Story 8
The first 15 episodes was very unoriginal, I forced myself to keep watching and not to drop, i found it kind of pointless that Gon start's the show with such average power being that he not received any differentiated training, But if you endure these things you will see more and more grandiose plots, chimera ants is one of the anime best Arc's of all time.
Art
                  8
Madhouse always doing a good job, no wonder it's my favorite studio, had moments I was anxious along with the character just by the visual effects
Sound 9
For those who have watched hundreds of animes like me, getting goose bumps only with a well-embedded soundtrack is not easy, HunterxHunter got it.
Character 10
Although I don't like Gon already start with a power stronger than others without having had a differentiated trainning, along the arc's you can follow the development of the 4 protagonists, you can see them getting stronger and discovering that the world is very large and they have a lot to learn, you can accompany a great development of support characters and villains too, and we also have Hisoka's, just a supporting character, but whenever it appears he steals the scene, he's funny, but at the same time sadistic, pervert and unpredictable, so unpredictable I do not know if a Classify him as an anti-hero or villain.
Enjoyment 9
I guess I don't need to talk so much anymore, I was patient and I was rewarded with one of the best animes of my life, the only thing I really hated was this hiatus, Come back Togashi :'(",9

                Hunter X Hunter is amazing. I've seen many reviews saying this is just another shounen anime, these reviews are by people who don't even watch shounen, so don't listen to them. It's not. The character development is insanely good. The characters are great. The way the power works in this anime is different, and cool. The way the story develops is interesting too. The story starts out very fun and friendly, like it would be a good anime for the younger spectrum of anime-watchers, but it takes a very smooth and gradual turn into becoming dark. The story is great, it's not that long and
                  the arcs are very interesting, they usually don't last too long. The music was just something else. I love all the tracks in the anime. The opening really gives the feeling of an adventure, and the music always fits the mood of what's happening in the anime. The people who give it a low score don't know that bungee gum possesses the properties of both gum and rubber.",10
"
                First time reviewing but upon finishing this series, I just had to (that's how much I enjoyed it). I've been watching anime for a very long time, but Hunter x Hunter is the first in a very long time that had me so invested, and probably the first to do so to this extent. 
Story:
It begins with a simple premise, with the protagonist Gon, a 12 year old boy, setting off to become a hunter: a profession that is supposedly so demanding and fulfilling that Gon's father chose to abandon Gon as a child in order to pursue it. Gon hopes to become a hunter
                  in order to meet his father, Ging, but also to see for himself what was so great about it in the first place. That's the beginning and overarching plot that classically gets complicated with villains and conflicts that sprout up along the way.
The story might seem immature and like a cliche shounen to some viewers, but in later arcs things get much deeper and even darker, despite how cheery and optimistic it seems in the beginning. I for one actually do adore the beginning arc as it introduces us to the characters in a lighthearted setting rather than putting on all the heaviness and pressure from the get-go. Within a couple arcs, I personally believe pacing is a bit questionable; there are some sequences, such as action sequences later on, that add on more run time than is necessary, but it's never anything that stops me from being engaged by what's going on in the plot.
Art:
The art has a bright, cheery look, but it's very clean and the animation is beautiful. As the mood of the show changes, the colors often follow suit—the later, darker arcs will not be that bright color pallet of the first few episodes. I've also watched the 1999 HxH and see that many are not fans of the bright colors of the 2011 adaptation, but I personally think it suits the atmosphere, especially in the beginning, with the premise of a child protagonist setting off on an adventure for the first time.
Sound:
Sound is one of the things that sticks out most to me in HxH. Voice acting, to me, was spot on—Gon's headstrong, naive attitude of a child is reflected well in his voice. The rest of the main cast also had voices that I thought suited them really well, especially Killua and Hisoka (I also thought Kurapika's softer voice that well matched his demeanor, and Leorio's was of course very lovable with the sort of brash, attempting-to-be-the-cool-guy quality).
The soundtrack is also amazing, there are many specific moments of the anime that I look back on specifically because of how much the OST contributed to them, which is always a good sign. Themes like Kingdom of Predators really make this anime's OST stand out from the rest, if you're a fan of orchestral themes then you'll enjoy this. I know there are people who get annoyed that the opening theme is the same throughout the anime, but I personally am impressed at how the opening goes along with the show no matter what point of the show it is, and it's enjoyable to see how it's animated differently as the story arcs change. The ending credits are also phenomenal—these do change, and suit their corresponding arcs.
Character:
This is by far the fastest 10 I'll give in this review. I find that Hunter x Hunter has something that many shows or any form of narrative struggles to do, and that is to provide lovable characters that still have astounding development. Gon pretty much embodies the character you root for; he's kind to those around him, always gives 100%, and the idea of him having such developed strength and senses while living on his island is such a fun concept. But he's not the typical shounen character that will win every fight or can get out of any pinch if he sees his friends are in trouble; he does fail, he does have shortcomings, and he has to be saved by other characters rather than the other way around. He's not invincible, and even his goody-two-shoes personality only goes so far; at the end of the day, he is just a kid who will sometimes act selfish because that's what kids do.
It's hard to talk about Gon without talking about Killua, who is the closest thing to a deuteragonist in the anime and becomes like a foil to Gon. Killua and Gon seem to be on opposite sides of the spectrum in both personality and upbringing; Gon is upbeat, cheery to a fault and can be a bit dim at times, while Killua shoulders a rough childhood, is sly and clever. Without spoiling the show, I will say that they both show amazing development and their friendship is such a pleasure to witness—nothing superficial or questionable in their actions, you can just tell how much they care for each other and how they make each other grow.
Kurapika and Leorio are the other protagonists, who also have very distinct personalities and pasts that affect their worldview. While they are definitely not as much in the spotlight as Gon and Killua, they are still very compelling and make you wish to see them during instances they are not around. The last that is arguably in the main cast is Hisoka, who takes the guise of a villain early on but comes around as more of a sinisterly neutral character as he gets more exposure. 
Enjoyment:
Nowadays I get a little hesitant when I see something over 25 or so episodes purely because I worry that things will drag on or other problems may arise far down the road. But I was so entertained by HxH's first couple episodes and ended up staying for the ride, and it only got better and better. New viewers may want to note that this anime is based off of the manga by Togashi Yoshihiro, and so it ends where the manga had been left off at the time. While it did make me antsy simply because I loved the anime so much and wanted more content, I do have to say that these 148 episodes are still a tightly knit, well executed package that was incredibly enjoyable in its entirety.
So if you're a fan of an adventure-style story, or even if you're not but are willing to give something a shot if it has good characters that have development, then I definitely recommend this anime. Fights are satisfying, well thought out, and for the most part do not ever drag. Characters, as I've stated, are very lovably and will get you attached. The story keeps you entertained but still ends up going in directions that probably weren't anticipated (it happened a lot with me, especially with the famous Chimera Ant arc). If you're unsure, then just give it a try!
Overall: 10/10. I watched the 1999 version right after completing this one because the withdrawal was so bad—it'll probably be a matter of time before I'm rewatching this again from the beginning!",10
"
                Written by the GOAT Togashi himself after Yu Yu Hakusho, and drawing inspirations from it, Hunter x Hunter 2011 is a masterpiece, and a benchmark for all shounen anime.
Story: This is an epic story of a boy who wants to become a Hunter like his dad and search for his dad. It's an incredible journey where he makes awesome friends after growing stronger together and overcoming adversities, on the path to becoming a Hunter. This is also where this show distinguishes and elevates itself above all other shounen. Unlike other shounen, the main characters doesn't go on endless winning streaks one after the other. The
                  main character doesn't simply learn a new ability or develop a new power to overcome the next tougher enemy. Losses, failure, frustration, these are all important stepping stones to becoming stronger, and the main characters don't have an easy path laid out in front of them, they have to earn it. The main protagonist is instantly likeable because he doesn't have any selfish motives, he just wants to become a hunter in order to find his dad. We find ourselves instantly empathizing with the kid and cheering him on through his arduous adventures. Far from being a happy-go-lucky adventure, the show often takes the viewer to gruesome places to emphasize the brutal nature of the world that they live in.
Choices: A recurring theme in this show is choices and their corresponding outcomes. Just like an interactive visual novel presents choices and multiple paths, the characters are presented with choices and diverging paths that would lead to significant outcomes that maintain their impact throughout the story. A great level of detail is given to the characters' thought process and their decision to select the various choices. The show is highly unpredictable, which is one of it's best qualities. Unlike most shounen, where we are just waiting for a particular outcome to occur, in this show, the outcome is unclear until the very last moment. Just like a game of rock, paper, scissors is simple, not complicated, and yet it's complex, even the unpredictability of the show is unpredictable. You never know where the journey leads until you arrive.
Pacing: The show takes it's time to fully develop the traits and motivations of the main characters, and antagonists. The world building is on another level. It shows the interactions between the main characters, and how their personalities clash against each other, and how they eventually become friends. There's always some downtime between heavy/hard-hitting/emotional/action-packed/information-packed episodes to cool the viewer down and just digest and process everything. The perfect blend of humor, action, suspense, world building, and emotions is just irresistible.
Music: Building a sense of awe and wonder at the adventure that lies ahead, pumping your blood all the way up in an action scene, tugging your heart strings just right in emotional scenes, making you forget to breathe for a moment during suspenseful scenes, the musical score is just extraordinary, and seamlessly guides the story.
Characters: The characters of this show are very realistic and Togashi's mastery of human psychology really shines through in them. Almost all characters have an individuality of character, motivations, and often clash against each other. The villains in the show are very interesting and their motivations are clear and believable. The vastly differing personalities have a serious impact on the trajectory of the entire story, and are not just there for cheap laughs as is seen in most generic shounens nowadays. Each character is multi-dimensional and remain true to their characters in every scene. This show also boasts incredible character development not just for the main characters but also most of the side characters, and villains.
Morality: There is no absolute good or evil in the show excepting a few truly sadistic characters. The characters are as real they get in terms of being shades of grey, including the main characters. The villains are portrayed as greedy, petty, sadistic, apathetic, psychopathic, etc but at the same time they aren't entirely devoid of values as many of them also show virtues of loyalty for their comrades, and concern for their well-being. The main characters struggle with their own morality and question their own actions and motivations from a moralistic stand point.
All-in-all, a great show, a must-watch, and a masterpiece for all anime fans.",10

                Hunter x Hunter is another splendid work by Madhouse. It is not today that this wonderful studio brings us joy and health producing anime, however, this one, shook my heart. The theme of this anime was a little generic, a rough shonen with a good story and charismatic characters, I hadn't seen the first version before this one in 2011, but right after watching the tenth episode I was already anxious to know what happened next. Hunter x Hunter delves into the shonen and brazenly plays with this theme, making high social criticisms, dealing with heavy themes that a child would not understand. The villains
                  are sensational, the sagas are incredible, the characters are spectacular, the animation, the production, the direction, practically everything in this anime is good. He manages to make you realize the cruel side of the heroes, making you think that they are the villains of the story! You can see how heavy the theme of each saga is (except for the letters) and how well the author approaches it. Honestly, it's my second favorite anime, behind One Punch Man.",10
"
                I went to see this work thinking it was more of a generic Shounen that everyone liked, and what I saw... One of the best works ever made. I had already been impressed by Togashi's other work, but this one managed to make me have a very different view of the author. The way everything is built and the characters, especially to get to the final arc. In which the entire development and message of the work is demonstrated in the best arc of all anime. We see Gon as a happy and cheerful boy, Killua as a killer without feelings. And in the end,
                  what we see is an entirely different shift. The final arc demonstrates a lot about the 2 sides. There is no right side, but one that will win. While the Hunters are trying to invade the place, another development of the ants is done. Gon is only there for one reason: revenge. and Killua is assisting him. And in the end we see the happy arrogant, and the sentimental murderer on account of his best friend. The action scenes, happiness, sadness are all connected. The fury of the happy, the feeling of the killer, the underrated Netero being the flame of this arc, very good characters, and a villain that is certainly one of the best. The sacrifice of the happy to fulfill itself, the sadness of seeing a friend leave, the monster becoming human, and a human changing him. We see the represented form of the infinite potential of humans. From evolving in the smallest of ways, the King had the strongest power in the world, but he couldn't kill her. The strongest of the Hunters didn't stand a chance against the King, but he had from the start, Checkmate in his hands. He managed to avenge Kaito, but what good was that? I want to protect my friend, but why did he do that? Why do I have feelings for a human? And because of her, now, I want to change. All sacrifices were made, but something was missing, the King's fury and rage. He just wanted something... Even though he was destroyed by the cruel power of humanity, he became human, staying until the end by the person's side, which made him change... Best anime arc, and one of the best works ever made.",10
"
                definitely one of the most, if not the most over hated anime. the story line, characters and their development, music, op and outro, fights, arcs, everything was absolutely amazing. i finished it a while ago and i have yet to find an anime that gives me the same nostalgic, happy feeling. there was not one episode that bored me and i was hooked from the very first one; each arc is so unique so you're always eager to see what happens next. overall, it's an incredible anime that i will never get bored of no matter how many times i rewatch it.

                I just completed Hunter x Hunter today and all I can say is just wow. This anime is so amazing, and I mean genuinely amazing. HxH has such an original plot and storyline, and if I hadn't been busy with schoolwork and such it is likely that I would've finished it in a week because I was so hooked. I especially admired Gon and Killua's friendship, which is one of the most powerful anime friendships I have ever seen, and their friendship isn't generic either. It is extremely evident that they deeply care for each other and I have never seen such passion in any
                  other anime. The characters of Gon and Killua in general just make their friendship all the more valuable as well. Next, the antagonists in this series are especially interesting. Again, they are very unique individuals and do not just stand as people to defeat. Hisoka, Chrollo, and Meruem, for example, each have their own personalities and showed great development over the series. Also, with characters such as Meruem, there were many dilemmas at play. For example, the idea that humans were worse than Chimera Ants (I will not go further into detail because I do not want to give spoilers). Hisoka, everyone's favorite magician, is particularly very unique for an antagonist throughout the series. I have seen that many villans, even in many other outstanding series, feel no need to keep their enemies alive. However, it is shown that Hisoka shows a level of care and respect for the people he wants to fight, such as Killua and Gon. He may see them as mere ""toys"" but it still takes respect and hope to believe that a target has potential, something that many antagonists do not like to consider when looking at the protagonists. I don't want to make this review too long so, overall, I 10/10 recommend HxH and it is sure to stir up many emotions, maybe even some that have laid dormant inside you. I hope that phrase doesn't make you think anything weird, but, I know you'll be sure to enjoy it. Thanks for reading my review and enjoy watching Hunter x Hunter! :)",10
"
                Like many others, the hype surrounding hunter x hunter and its combat system were the reasons I watched the show. And honestly, it is that same hype that made me enjoy it less. I mostly talk negatives in this review, which unfair to the show and unfaithful to the overall score, but given the popularity of the show (and not wanting to stretch this out TOO MUCH) I'd rather point out the flaws that stick out in my eyes.
And that's what I want to begin with... the combat system did not feel like this crazy amazing thing I was led to believe. Now don't get
                  me wrong, the base is all there. The amount of detail and thought put behind it is like nothing my novice eyes have seen. But despite all that exposition and charts and explanations we get, stuff still feels vague. And what I felt like too few fights did not help elevate that feeling. It feels like a system that can be easily exploited by the ""freedom of imagination"" that it is praised to be. And that would have never matter to me if I didn't overthink it from the start because of my expectations.
I understand that this is a subjective feeling in what should be ,for the most part, an impartial review. The anime itself is really not as much at fault, but given the show's reputation it is clear that many people will come to expect certain things hence the need for me to point out and critic this aspect of the show.
Quick last thing on the combat (sorry), I loved some of the fights, Morel is one of my favorite characters because of his fights. Killua's lighting and yo-yo where also stuff, I greatly enjoyed especially because we get to see him testing stuff out and coming up with new ideas. On the other hand, I can't help but feel like I am missing something (sorry if I am), but Gon's ability feels stagnant and really boring to me, but at least it doesn't ruin the enjoyment of most of his fight. Hate me all you want for the next thing I am about to say but ""fast coin throwing"" is the biggest disappointment of an ability from what I thought was an interesting character. 
AND NOW MOVING AWAY FROM THE COMBAT....
The show was overall great. The characters are great. Gon enthusiastic and stubborn nature never feels annoying and not genuine and his growth through the show is amazing (my god I loved episode 116) and doesn't feel random. Killua has a great backstory and his character creates both antithesis and similarities with Gon creating a realistic friendship. Most antagonist have something unique (ok maybe not bomber) and I am not gonna lie, the emotional scene with Meruem got me hard.
Soundtrack is great albeit a little repetitive at times. The second ending really stands out and blends amazingly at the end of each episode hyping you for the next.
Animation is also outstanding with no dips in quality. It's also very brutal and bloody, making it more immersive and less ""cartoony"" really setting up the mood for the whole series.
I have to make a note about the much talked Chimera Ant arc as it is the most controversial. It is slow. After so much build up and things are soon as to go down, hunter x hunter hits you with tons of narration. Now, the execution is unique, that is for sure. And I loved parts of it, mostly in combat. But there are parts where it is actually useless, giving you information you already know or padding what could have been said in a few words. If you are invested in the show, it won't make you drop although maybe it ll halt your binging for a bit. But it is a definite negative of the arc because of the overuse of its storytelling method. To be honest, I am more disappointed, by another part of this arc. Just to be safe, SPOILERS AHEAD PLEASE SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH. Ok, I really don't like how Meruem is brought back after the bomb explosion. I get that the emotional scene later on need to happen and I am all for it. But I had to suspend my disbelief way too much. He survives an up-close nuke, is burned to a crisp and has lost both legs and hands and he just comes back stronger. This COULD have been done more realistically, but the show wants to complete subversion for suspension effect. It downplays the previous fight AND makes the virus later on all the more unbelievable in my opinion. I see no reason for it to be this way other than cheap thrill and tension and it's one of my big complaints of the arc.
Conclusion:
Hunter x hunter is worth watching. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT. If you can leave all the hype behind, you are almost guaranteed to have a good time and perhaps, a new show to call a favorite.",8
"
                I'll start off by saying this is my FAVORITE anime of all time, altough I have about 5 animes which I rated 10/10. I've watched this only in 2015 so I've missed the hype train so I'm NOT writting this because everyone gave it good reviews and bla bla. 
The plot is outstanding, the narration and sound is amazing, the characters are diverse with different goals and perspective, many characters get more than plenty of screen times and you get to see them more than once as the plot moves on. This show also has many psychological and biblical refferences that not everyone notices (check
                  different youtube videos made about this anime) which is even more outstanding that someone can fit all of this in just 140+ episodes (if I remember correctly). There's no point in going into details since u have already heard it thousands of times on every other review. I'll just say this, if u haven't seen it, DO IT !
Favorite character: NONE - I know. It's weird to say that you don't have a favorite character in your favorite anime, but that's what makes it amazing. I just enjoy the interaction of every character without being captive by having someone stand out from the rest. That's one of the things that makes this anime stand out from the rest.
SCORE
1. why not higher? There's no 11/10. 
2. why not lower? I'm sure that if nitpick you might find something that you didn't quite like, but there's no flaw that really stands out.My only 9/10 was for ""art"" since I think it could've been done better, but since it's a anime that originally ran in 1999 they couldn't have done any major changes to it, so it's understandable.
Notes:
This anime was seriously addicting. At the end of the ""Chimera arc"", I couldn't turn off the TV. I watched like 20 episodes one after another without doing anything else. Kept watching all night until like 8 AM in the morning.",10
"
                It is fantastic. As far as shoenens go, it is the gold standard. The growth of the characters is so natural over the course of the series. A good amount of unpredictability by not using many cliches common in the genre. Characters are very well-written. Some of the best moments in all of anime. Very close to a 10, only thing that held it back was how it feels unfinished because they set up arcs for the future while attempting to give a satisfying ending. This makes it feel uncertain whether it was the end of the series and detracted from its conclusion. Nevertheless, it
                  is a definite classic and the Chimara Ant arc alone can’t be called anything but a masterpiece.",9

                First of all I will just say, the show is amazing! I wanted to watch since long time ago but 148 episodes stop me from it as I though it will take me half a year to finish. And guess what? I finished it in 8 days! 8 days ONLY!
The story is amazing but I disagree most of the comment leave by others that say it did everything right or should score 10 as nothing went wrong, but I totally agree it is one of the most amazing anime and I think it can score 10.
There will be a little bit of spoiler so stop
                  reading if you don't want to get spoiled.
Let me point out a few thing that is ""not doing right"" (at least to me) is including:
-Firstly, the training/fighting time vs the actual story time (the impression they trying to show is as if they took a lot of time training but in actual story time it seems lesser). This is especially obvious when the fight in palace in the last arc where they fought for quite long but according to what it said it had only been less than 10 seconds. I can understand some anime slow down when thinking or fighting but I just can't accept they say is only 10 seconds. It is also shown when Bisky training them in greed Island as between Phantom Troupe arc (September) and second hunter test (start of next year) they had been training for quite a  while but it seems like that 3 months doesn't quite fit in.
-Second, the strength of all Characters. So at first Gon and Killua seems one of the top few strongest in the test. But when they go for the Heaven Arena above 200 floors  it seems that they are so weak as they don't know the real power ""nen"" yet. (And I am still fine with that) and slowly to Phantom Troupe arc which every one in it are so OP (I can still accept this as we need op opponent to make the show fun) but ant?ANT? An Ant King that beat the shit out of the strongest human? Just how pathetic they trying to show human is?
-Thirdly, some of the pace in the show. Sometimes the pace is slow in term of them showing the walking scene for a while or sometimes too fast that I thought I missed an episode. So two of the best examples are when Pitou and gon walk to ""save"" Kite (when reaching) the walking scene is a bit too long and another example is in episode 146 when Gon suddenly tell his father that kite became a girl? WTF is my only thought in mind at that moment. I thought I missed an episode and spend about half hour to look back every episodes and even search online. And apparently I didn't miss any.
-Last but not least the time line for each characters. Kurapika is one of them which I thought will be almost everywhere in the show but after phatom troupe arc it didnt appear more than 1 minute(I guess) and a lot other characters like kite that I think will guide them easily dead and never appear until second last episode and Hisako also and Bisky and Ging and ..and ... and... .... there will be no end of list.
But all of you who follow me through please don't get the wrong idea! It is still an amazing show despite having a few ""wrong doing"". I will simply list a few points only as most of other commend did well in explaining them.
- Each characters have their own special (including ants)
- Story are amazing and almost every episodes kept me entertain
- Fighting scene are amazing considering a 2011 anime
- Feeling are able to reach me strong (like hate in Gon after Kite dead) (Killua and Alluka sad story) etc
- Hisako made the first and third arc amazing (having a villain like him really made the show better than pure villain)
And there are a lot others minor minor points.
So if you haven't watch, please at least spend 2 days to finish hunter test arc before you decide to continue or not.
And before I end PITOU is the best! (If she is not an enermy or never try to fight Gon at last). So Bisky is the best! (If she is not 57 or muscular). Thus, ALUKKA and SOMETHING ARE THE BEST NO DOUBT!",9

                Saying this anime is a masterpiece is not even enough to describe it. I just can't stop thinking HxH for couple of years. When I watch any other thing or think of an art form I just can't get satisfied. Watching this anime made me think in a different perspective and saved me from depression.
Music? Yeah perfect symphony.
In anime some visuals were not that good so I think it is 9 for visual
Story? Realistic flow
Character dev? Realistic flow.
I enjoyed every part of this piece of godly truth. I just can't get enough of this. Even if it doesn't continue I still like it. Hiayus doesn't
                  make this anime worse. I think that it is not the outcome but the journey itself.",10
"
                I'm writing this review now, cause I basically created the account recently (never tought to open it) btw HxH is a truly masterpiece, 150+ episodes where every single one is interesting. All characters are well developed, especially in my opinion Meruem who is an incredible villain. Sadly the anime as for the manga is not finished, but we have anyway we have a sort of proper ending and not a random interruption :)
My fav. character is Hisoka. I wanted too see him more frequently, but sadly is basically present at the beginning and during the ending parts.
PS:probably one of the best fight is Meruem vs
                  Netero, his praying skill are amazing XD",9

                History: The history of Hunter X Hunter can be misleading in the early episodes, as it gives the impression of being an anime for children, and perhaps why some have thought that the anime is childish. The first arc really seems cliché, but when it comes to its climax the storyline plays in your face all the seriousness of the series. A story that shows how characters can be so similar and yet so different in their ambitions. One that comes to genocide and ambitions of an extremely detailed. Art: The animation and ambiance of this anime are complex and moldable, adapting to each arc
                  in a different way, but competent. Sound: The soundtrack may be the only point where this anime not edge to perfection, this due to the same openness in all arches, despite the animations are exchanged. The opening comes seasick, but nothing to disturb the sound experience of the anime itself. Characters: The characters of Hunter X Hunter are different and well structured, each with multiple layers. Most exhibit great charisma, even pedophiles murderers has its charm in this anime ambitions. Enjoyment: At first it may be difficult to bring the anime seriously, but in its first climax the work already shows its grandeur, it is impossible to have no desire to devour all the episodes at once. Final conclusions: It is in my opinion the best anime ever made, but it's obvious that Berserk had to adapt the height Hunter X Hunter would be number 2. But until that day arrives Hunter X Hunter remains on the throne of my list of anime . An intense story with great plot, well-developed characters, great soundtrack, and of course, flawless animation.",10

                I felt that I have to write something about this anime because the amount of disappointment I got from it is immeasurable. I apologize in advance for my bad English but it is not my native language. First off, bfore watching it I was getting information that this is one of the best if not the best shounen anime so my expectations were really high. First arc- EXAM: It was great and i really enjoyed it, I was getting vibes of the original Dragoon Ball and I loved it. I was kind of disappointed at the end though, but overall it was really great arc.
                  Next arc- Zoldyck Family Arc: Here is where my disapponment rose to the surface again. I expected cool fights with the Zoldyck family but instead they just went in and left and nothing really happened, but overall arc was decent because at that point I was still invested. Then we had the training arc which I omit. The next is (in my opinion the best arc) Phantom Troupe Arc: It strted great, it got me hooked and was really invested, but unfortunately again i was disapointed. They showed us the whole group of bad guys just to beat 2 or 3 of them and then they are gone (yes, they appear later but they are not relevant to the story so I don't care). We didn't even have the fight between Chrollo and Hisoka...meh. I will omit Greed Island arc because it was really boring. Only part from dodgeball onward was somehow enjoyable. Now we have the reason why I am writing this review. The Chimera Ant Arc: I listened to a lot of praises about this arc, how amazing it is etc. It was for me the worst arc in the whole show. It was unecessary long. The setup for the enemies was done ok, but some episodes were unnecessary (for example the whole backstory of some leader or somesuch). I did not care for any characters. Only Kite was ok, but then they had to kill him off at the beginning of the arc. The episodes about the raid on palace was soooo freaking long. The stupid narrator destroyed the whole immersion to the world. Do the authors think that we are stupid that they have to literally tell us what characters are thinking about in this moment? Thanks, but I can see it if you are able to show it and not tell me. It was the first time in my anime history that I had to sped up the episodes. For the shounen anime there was not too many fights. The conclusion of the arc was well thought but the whole presence of it totally ruined it. The last arc: Ok, just ok.  To conclude, hearing about this anime I really thought it will be the hidden gem but I guess it was too overhyped. The chimera ant arc totally ruined the show for me. I wanted cool fights between characters but what I got? Presenting us with great characters and then they are gone just because. I would not say that this is the best anime but it was not the worst either. It was ok but it could much much better. The BIG DISAPOINTMENT.",6
"
                I had trouble getting into it because i thought the characters were not likable, not uninterresting, but I couldn't get attached to them because of their lack of emotions. 
Then comes York Shin City, which is the first arc I really enjoyed, Kurapika was the only one that I kinda liked before that and seeing him as the main protagonist for this arc was really satisfaying. Also The Phantom Troup is one of the best team in Anime History.
Greed Island was good, very different from the rest and perhaps the less character focused arc. I already kinda forget it tho.
And then there's Chimera Ant, ooooh
                  boy. There is like, absolutly no doubt that this is my favorite arc. Everything was perfect with this one, the story, the fights, there's not a single thing I didn't like about this one. But the real reason why I liked it so much was that finally, Gon and Killua were developped. That was really the thing that prevented me from beeing invested in the show. From this point I really loved them.
Not much to say about last arc, feels kinda underwhelming to finish the anime on this one after the masterpiece that was Chimera Ant.
To conclude I think this was a very good show, with awesome moments, but that its lack of emotions for the 50 first episodes prevented me from enjoying it from startto finish.",9
"
                I can't begin to express the sheer amount of joy this show has brought to my life. The story, which might not appear to be compelling initially has made me feel such a great variety of emotions from joy to sadness. Every single part of this masterpiece connects to one another almost too perfectly. The characters, the relationships of said characters, the plot, the setting and the pacing is so well structured that you often have to remind yourself that you are indeed experiencing a story, not something you would encounter in real life. Every arc ends and begins instantly and fluidly, without any plot
                  conveniences or time skips. Honestly, I could go on writing about how great of a series Hunter × Hunter is until I die but here's one thing that is true without a doubt. Yoshihiro Togashi is an absolute mastermind in storytelling. Just go and watch this show already to be honest. It'll bring you nothing but immense joy.",10
"
                Hunter x Hunter is one of the more mature and developed series, and it does a great job at bringing you into the story. The characters are natural, as in they don't try too hard to be a certain way, even Leorio with all of his extrovertedness is a consistently natural character because he contrasts with the rest ; this is part of the maturity. It is also subtle.
The arcs are great as standalone.
The chimera arc shows the most outstanding emotion and development, even though the chimera arc is a few times longer than the rest (throws off the pacing a little). Other than that,
                  I am a sucker for irony, and it delivers it when it matters.
I think HxH is best for the seasoned anime watcher. Before watching, it may be better to have already watched shorter anime so you can get a taste of the possibilities. Then you will be able to appreciate the taste of a more developed anime like HxH.
It's too bad the series is on indefinite hiatus, but you can essentially be satisfied with how the latest arc ended. We get the idea of how power is not wholly reliant on training or personal strength, and given all of the details of the story, you get a pretty good picture of the HxH world and can resolve the character plots if you want. Any more would be a treat, really.",9

                Hunter x Hunter is honestly my all time favorite anime and i constantly talk about with my friends and family though, my parents don't like anime.
I got multiple people in hunter x hunter so It feels good to be able to talk about it
(we have a joke going around in the family that Killua is my bf (I'm 14))
Story: 9.5/10
The story was great, A little boy doing all the things he can to do to find his father and meeting a few friends on the way.
Art: 10/10
I've gotten so used to drawing the art style and the close up work is so beautiful.Sound: 10/10
The sound was amazing, and the music was great
Character: 9/10
There are a lot of odd characters, But also a lot of beautiful characters too.
Enjoyment: 10/10
How could I have not enjoyed my all time favorite anime?
Overall: 10/10
definitely would recommend this to anyone that hasn't seen the anime",10

                How can a shōnen be so intense and well thought out?
Hunter X Hunter was first released in 1998. It is still going on even if there are actually less than 400 chapters (One Piece has been in progress since 1997 with more than 900 chapters / Naruto was published in 1999 and ended in 700 chapters).
This manga is well-known for having the greatest number of breaks (with Berserk). Fans are looking forward to the next chapters and a new anime.
There are 2 versions of the anime. The 2011 version covers about the majority of the manga. In my opinion, the only flaw of the manga
                  is the drawing however the anime has reworked the features of the characters making them much more enjoyable to watch.
So where to start my review...
First of all, some might be doubtful about starting this manga because of the age of the two main characters: Gon and Killua. They are 11 years old which looks pretty young and yet :This manga is a masterpiece, one of the best shonen I have ever seen/read. It has nothing to envy to its fellows Naruto or even One Piece (even if the two mangas are also classics).
Highly charismatic characters
None of the characters are alike except for the long nose which can surprise at first. Women are as badass as men, the oldest ones are as adventurous as the youngest ones. Clearly there is no weak character in Hunter X Hunter. This is not a question about physical strength, it is about intelligence and the mastery of his own power.
Some antagonists are looking for absolute power. We are not overflowed with backgrounds sadder than the others. The bad guys are bad, end of story! You will hate some of them while you will adore others like Hisoka, an antagonist who can sometimes become an ally, he is recognizable since he is inspired by the Joker.
Friendship is certainly exploited but this bond allows each character to surpass himself by training. They don't get strong just like this is nothing. They train, they learn from their mistakes, they implement strategies and rely on each other.
The Nen is to Hunter X Hunter what the chakra is to Naruto
In short, each character can develop a power, it is up to him to choose it according to some criteria. Therefore, we can see completely different powers and above all very well exploited.
Smart fights
Physical strength is not everything, the context of the fight, the analysis of his opponent, the control of his power are extremely useful. There are few power-ups unlike many of shōnens which, in my opinion, use its too often. With Hunter X Hunter, strategy first and that is why this is so great. We are always surprised asking for more and more.
In summary
I regularly watch scenes or even whole arcs of this anime. For me the arcs ""Yorkshin City"" and ""Kimera Ants"" are among the best arcs all shōnens included. In Hunter X Hunter nothing is taken for granted, what will pay off is work and will. So trust me, you're clearly not going to be disappointed. The only risk? To become more demanding and to not be able to find a manga as good as Hunter X Hunter.",10
"
                A fantastic 10/10. Great characters, amazing development. This anime contains a generous amount of comedy, great action scenes, great story line. While the plots are very straight forward and simple(like Gon!) This anime is a masterpiece. There's no way you can watch this anime and be disappointed. One of the most enjoyable anime I've watched. You can't but love Gon. 
This anime is a fun ride from beginning to finish. One of the main things I like about it is the growth of the characters. You initially think they are strong, but when compared to the elite, they don't compare. They hit barriers and overcome
                  them.",10
"
                This easily is my top 3 anime of all time, I had such a great time watching this.
My favorite arcs were the hunter exam (which is an amazing way to start an anime) and the chimera ant arc.
Seeing the friendship between Gon and Killua progress was surely something.
The cons i have with this anime is that i found the phantom troupe to be slightly boring and the chimera ant arc feeling a bit slow at times.
I also do on plan on reading the manga, even if it has a lot of hiatuses.
10/10 anime, I have nothing more to say.

Story: This anime series really made me happy... At the beginning of the journey of our heroes we think it will be always a happy setting where nobody needs to die... the longer u follow the story the more u will see the
                  character development... the story is getting darker and darker... specially at the last arc u will see: Holy shit this anime has a fucking good development and u can really feel it... so the story is worth 10/10. I don't want to spoiler the story so we go to the next point Art!
Art: Well the creater of the series was Madhouse... and they do normally always a good job. Specially for a long shounen the art is quit very good.
Sound: The openings were always the same sound but it fit perfectly HunterxHunter. I loved every ending of the series and even the ost was very good and I know them until now!
Character: Every main character in HunterxHunter is special... Gon is a very friendly boy but if he is angry you should be afraid... Killua is a very badass character but i really like him... Leorio is the one which is watch out for everyone and is really likeable... Kurapika is often fighting with leorio but just as friends and he is very nice to his friends... and even some supporting characters are very amazing and you will like some of them and maybe hate some of them.
Enjoyment: At the first few episodes I was enjoying hunterxhunter as a normally but not as one of the best anime so far. But the longer you watch it the more you will enjoy hunterxhunter which his very good shounen story and the very amazing character development. The Art and the Sound complete hunterxhunter perfectly! So YES the enjoyment is really good.
Overall: If u want to look a new shounen I would instantly recommend hunterxhunter. Also if u just want to look a new anime I would instantly recommend hunterxhunter als long as u didn't watch it!                                   ( Sorry for my bad english... This was my first Review)",10

                Hunter x Hunter is my number 1 favorite anime
Synopsis :
In short, this HxH tells the adventures of Gon Freecss to become a Hunter and find his father
Reasons I like HxH:
1) The story is complex because each character has their own goals that lead us to different and interesting stories to follow
2) The battles are unpredictable and exciting, of course unlike other shnen anime, here we can't be 100% sure who will win in every battle that is shown even if the one fighting is the main character because not all villains can be defeated by the main character if the enemy is too strong and
                  the main character has not been able to defeat him, which means that there must be another character who is equal to fight the villain, so the strongest enemy must not be forced to be defeated by the main character, that is what makes the battle in the HxH anime interesting.
3) The villains are cool and their loyalty is exemplary. Phantom Troupe (Genei Ryodan) is still the coolest villain organization for me besides Akatsuki in the Naruto anime and the Chimera Ant and York New City arcs are still my favorite arc in the HxH anime. One of the reasons is because of the villains. cool
4) The power system is complicated but interesting if in Naruto there is Chakra in HxH there is something called ""Nen"" there are six types, namely Enchantment (Kyoka), Transmutation (Henka-kei), Conjuration (Gugenka-kei), Specialization (Tokushitsu-kei), Emissions (Hoshutsu-kei), and Manipulation (Sasa-kei) are too many, right? but that's what makes this power in HxH interesting
5) The friendship between Gon and his friends is very sweet, especially with Killua Zoldyck for a 12 year old boy, their solidarity is very high and the humor is also good
6) There are so many mysteries that make us as viewers speculate like how strong Ging Freecss (Father of Gon Freecss) is, the origin of Alluka Zoldyck and Nanika (Alluka's Alterego), how Kite can live again, how will Nen Chrollo Lucilfer return, and many more
7) Finally, the visuals presented and the original soundtrack are good
Anyway, in my point of view, Hunter x Hunter is perfect, the only drawback is that it's often on hiatus, that's all from me",10

                I just finished HxH about a week ago, and I have to say it is 11/10 AMAZING! It's EVERYTHING to love about an anime! (Especially the final arc!)
Story: 10/10
HxH is a typical adventure story following Gon and Killua, along with many of their friends. But let me tell you, there is NOT A SINGLE boring moment throughout the entire story! Sometimes we wouldn't see our main protagonists for several episodes, but it was hardly even noticeable thats how flawless the story construction is! I do have to say, there is ONE thing I could not stand about this anime. The narrator. He usually only spoke
                  at the end of the episode, so fine, whatever, just skipped him. But he was just an unnecessary piece to this story. Still, 10/10 regardless, since his impact is that small.
The battles are what I like to call ""intelligent battles"" where tactics, planning, and adaptability all come into play. There is no mindless brawling, but rather each move, each strike is a move to back their opponent into checkmate. Psychological and emotional trauma  is another key element the story introduces so smoothly, that I found myself bonding with these characters and calling out to them throughout many critical scenes.
Art: 10/10
The art style is pretty normal honestly, but fits 100% with the story! Gon and Killua ACTUALLY look like they're 12... I know, crazy right? And gosh, the emotions portrayed were just flawless! It completely enveloped me into their story, their world, and their lives! Character designs were unique, badass, and cool! Not even the side characters were left unpolished! In a game of guess the main character, you'd never win in HxH! This type of style was super interesting to see! Also, those huge eyes... I love them! Makes Gon look so cute and innocent all the time X2
Sound: 10/10
Music is phenomenal with catchy openings and awesome battle music that makes you wanna kick ass with a fishing rod! (No joke!) There really isn't much to say about it, except it thoroughly fits the story and is throughout enjoyable to listen to with and without the story accompanyment.
Characters: 10/10
The characters are really what makes it such a great anime.. they are all such interesting characters with very distinct, unique personalities, quirks, and thought process. I personally love anime where I'm able to see inside the characters' heads and predict how they will handle certain situations throughout, and HxH executes that extremely well! Even the final ""enemy"" ended up being one of my favorites! Not to even mention their unique fighting styles. They were all exciting, interesting, and new to watch. These characters made you bond with them as if they were real! They were deep, motivated, and beyond exciting to watch! It didn't matter their status of friend or foe because characters from either side were great! Definitely not the best people. .. but as characters they are 10/10 themselves! (Especially Mereum!)
Gon and Killua's rivalry/friendship is my MOST favorite anime friendship! They are 100% rivals but never at odds with each other (Natsu and Gray // Naruto and Sasuke) which is truly what makes their bond so special. They spur each other to become better, stronger.. constantly competing, but are always smiling to each other. 
Enjoyment: 10/10
Now was you can probably tell from my review, I adored this anime! It's settled into its rightful spot on my top tens. It's pretty much a flawless, deep, emotional, adventure anime. It really doesn't have any weak points in my opinion and is strong in every category. But don't jump into this thinking you're in for some lighthearted adventure with two cute little boys because let me tell you, this anime is anything but. You gotta be ready for some shit to go down, because this anime will lead you through emotions like you wouldn't believe. Also some pretty messed up stuff too. 
Overall: 10/10
Like I said, Hunter x Hunter is a masterpiece! The fights developed the characters, were eye-catching, heart-pounding, edge-of-your-seat fights that we expect of anime action! I can almost guarantee you it won't leave you dossappointed! The pacing is great, meaning there is never a dull moment! Definitely will watch again and recommend it completely!  :)",10

                im literally only rating this show a 10/10 because the chimera ant arc is the best anime arc ive ever seen in my life. seasons 3 and 4 are great aswell. 
to anyone saying this show is below a 7, you clearly havent watched season 5 yet.
season 5 has such a good story combined with very good character development and enjoyability. the first time around when i watched it i couldnt stop. i stayed up till 3 am on school nights for a whole week straight to keep watching the show.
another thing is that i believe that this show has the best ending songs of
                  any show ever. endings 2,5, and 6 are all better than alot of openings ive seen and openings are typically meant to have more effort put into them. 
anyway if you get discouraged to keep watching on season 1, dont stop. it gets so much better trust me.",10
"
                A good series that could have been great, the 2011 Hunter x Hunter is held back by how the plot structure was handled.  The series starts out arc-based, with stories that offer fairly concrete starting and stopping points and, while the stories they tell are nothing new in and of themselves, there are enough unique ideas on display to keep them from feeling stale.
The first problems start to show up in the Yorknew arc: the story is primarily focused on Kurapika, with Gon and Killua primarily serving in a secondary role.  The arc would be by far the strongest in the story if
                  not for the resolution half-heartedly bleeding into the Greed Island arc before the entire plot thread gets dropped without a real resolution in favor of the Chimera Ant arc.
Speaking of the Chimera Ant arc, nearly half of the show's episodes are in it.  While dropping everything for a bit to start a new arc isn't a problem in and of itself, freezing two thirds of the characters out of the story for 61 episodes results in a storyline that dragged on quite a bit, in spite of being based in a really interesting premise and sporting compelling themes.  One of the antagonists in particular seems to exist almost entirely to delay the resolution of the arc, which makes the entire thing intensely frustrating and somewhat undercuts what should have been a satisfying conclusion to the story.
I would not call Hunter x Hunter 'poorly written', however, because of just how phenomenally the presentation of the characters is handled.  The lack of real resolution to Kurapika's story arc is only frustrating because Kurapika comes across as a very compelling presentation of a fairly cliché character archetype.  Leorio's presence is enjoyable in spite of him being about as useful as Krillin, and the supporting cast as a whole is very solid and well-rounded.  Gon and Killua, the two central protagonists, are also worth noting, as more than anything else the interactions between the two of them frequently hold the story together when it would have otherwise come apart.
If you are reading this and wondering why I started a review of a Shonen Battle Anime with three long paragraphs about the story: there's not really much to criticize about Hunter X Hunter in those terms.  Every fight - including when people aren't actually 'fighting' - is at the bare minimum interesting, with some of the most inventive ideas for powers around.  Standouts include one fighter using a giant mecha buddha to hundred-hand slap someone and the only fight to ever be won through the application of APR financing.  Direction is spot-on, though only rarely is the envelope pushed.
Animation quality ranges from 'good' to 'excellent', and while you are unlikely to be totally blown away by anything on display, some scenes are at the very least quite impressive.  The audio has a couple of pretty good pieces of music, and one particularly terrible one featuring a sliding trombone sting that sounds not only out of place in terms of the instrumentation but also seems to be totally disjointed from the rhythm of the song.
All in all, it's a solid series; more than anything, it feels as though it was held back by the source material not yet having reached conclusions to the loose ends it leaves.  It's definitely worth at least a look, particularly if you want something that will last you for a good long time.",7

                //SPOILERS// Hunter X Hunter is my favourite anime for many different reasons it is a truly fantastic anime crafted with dedication and passion by Mangaka - Yoshihiro Togashi. Many people unnecessarily hate on this anime due to its long hiatus however I feel that we should just be grateful with what we have gotten to experience with this marvellous piece of fiction. In this review I will break down the themes and aspects of the show that makes it a great anime.
What is it about? – Hunter X Hunter takes place in a world similar to our own but with some fantastical aspects, we
                  follow our protagonist a 12-year-old boy named Gon Freeces and watch him overcome challenges and defeat enemies becoming the greatest profession in the world a ‘Hunter’ in order to ultimately find his dad who is also a professional hunter and who left Gon to peruse his career. Along the way he makes many friends and experiences great triumphs and unbearable losses.
What makes it different? – Similarly, Hunter X Hunter shares many characteristics and ideas like other works in Shonen Jump for instance it is adventure and action-based nature, however Hunter X Hunter stands out because of its different approach to these themes, for example although it is a battle-based show their is not many fights however, the ones that do take place are carefully choreographed with lots of explanatory mid fight talks and analysis. These factors combined with the many dark and real-world themes embedded deeply in the show, themes like depression, revenge, horror, humanities redemption and the parallels in the shows (chimera and arc) between the protagonist Gon and primary antagonist of the chimera ant arc Meruem when we see our “hero” slowly turn into a monster and our villainous monster slowly turn more into more of a human. And the fact that all this is hidden behind the shows seemly bright and cheerful childish nature, just further boldly distinguishes this show from others in in the same genre. Simple things like the way both characters sit, once pointed out clearly hint at their opposing developments even though these two characters never actually meet.
What was the inspiration behind it? – The shows author/mangaka Yoshihiro Togashi main motivation was to create a “hit” but it ended up as a piece of work that he became closely connected and deeply focused on. The inspiration from the name came from Togashi’s childhood, he liked to collect various things and would hunt around towns and cities for them and from this he knew he wanted to have the title include the word Hunter and for the series to be based around the connotations of this profession. Furthermore, he enjoyed watching shows that have the classic good and evil plot but with suspenseful fights and horrific deaths and emotional motivations, and he wanted to include all of these things in Hunter X Hunter.
What emotions does the show create? – Togashi is brilliant at getting his audience to root and get connected emotionally to is characters by giving them likable and unlikable characteristics this gave him the freedom to play with the viewers emotion and create ones like happiness, estimated but also sadness, anger and fear of what some of the characters become.
Overall, Hunter X Hunter is a truly epic journey and adventure each arc brings something new to the table and the is a perfect balance between light and dark moments in the series. All the charters develop in interesting and diverse ways with heavy feelings and tones being utilized to help emphasise scenes and messages that Togashi is Trying to convey that reflect our real world which he draws inspiration from and while I don't deny that come parts of the series can be slow, there is plenty of breath-taking and magnificent moments that make this anime trly worth watching and that is why I have rated it a 10/10",10

                BEST SHOUNEN ANIME.
Story : 10/10 
im addicted to every episode of this anime. what a great anime. I watched 1st episode and i found it interesting. there are so many anime that only have a good story at the beginning  but after that it will get weird and boring.i will never get bored with Gon and Killua adventure. Every arc is perfect. My fav arc will always be chimera ant and phantom troupe. 
Art : 10/10 
all i can say is Madhouse really nailed it. 
Sound : 10/10

And ending number 2,5,and 6 are the best. for the original soundtack, its f*****g brilliant. its suits every episode especially when meruem died, they put really good soundtrack, and when genei ryodan arc appeared they put a very good and badass soundtrack 
Character : 10/10
I love every character lol (except pouf). a lot of chara has a great development character especially killua and meruem. first arc, killua was heartless assassin boy that only think only for himself and gon but as time goes by he becomes a great friend not only to gon but also to kurapika and leorio. Meruem also becoming a good character each episode. its the same like killua, from heartless person to be kind and care for another person. So yeah, my fav character is killua and feitan (lol its surprising that feitan will be my fav chara)

                Tbh idk why I love this show so much, it wasn’t a part of my childhood it was just a show that I decided to watch out of the blue. In my opinion my review cannot do this anime justice and I cannot recommend this show enough.
Story- 10/10: To start off, the anime, in my opinion, is very fun to watch. It consists of 7 arcs, which are all different in mood/atmosphere from the previous arc. This difference makes it very refreshing to watch and is what captivated me. While I’ve watched HxH twice, I was never bored in my second watch despite it only
                  being a couple of months since I finished the show the first time. This show, in my second watch, was almost the thing that made me cry (which means a lot cuz I do not remember the last time I cried due to emotions). Despite already knowing what was going to happen, my eyes were tearing up in the emotional scenes and I couldn’t stop shaking in tense scenes. The animation, the soundtrack, and the voice acting all blends in beautifully to make, in my mind, a masterpiece. I will admit I have seen/heard criticisms of either the show starting off slow or there are points in which it feels slow, but I believe that the payoffs are great that makes the show worthwhile.
As I stated previously that the mood of one arc is different than the one it succeeds, but the transitions are very natural. Although this is listed as a shounen I feel this is different from other shounens, not because it has aspects that are dark (a point I hear often), but because it feels realistic. While most of the other shounens I have watched is mainly a battle of brute strength and where the main protagonist receives a power boost with seemingly little to no consequence to beat the overpowered villain, HxH’s fights are mainly strategy based and there are consequences/limits to the power the protagonists get. This can be attributed to the power scale, nen, which I will not specify due to this review being very long. Also the fights last like 1 or 2 episodes unlike shows like Dragon Ball where the final battle, in my opinion, feels overdrawn by lasting over double digit episodes. The last point I want to bring up is that the fact that there is a fine line between good and evil. There were episodes where I went in feeling really excited for what was to happen but by the end of the episode was questioning whether what occurred felt right. While we are led to believe that we should root for the protagonist and whatever they do, this show often pushes the boundaries and leaves you questioning if it is right to root for the protagonist to continue on the road they are going.
Art- 10/10: The bright colors of this show makes it seem like it's a happy show, and this is a perfect illustration of don’t judge a book by its cover. The animation played an integral role in keeping me immersed in the show. The art portrayed the emotions of the scenes very well, for example in episode 130 the use of color (all blue or all red) gave a stronger impact for the scene. The occasional usage of black and white and then a sudden introduction of another color, like red, was very pleasing to look at.
I will talk about voice acting in art because I believe that voice acting is a form of art. The sub voice actors were perfect for their roles, and played probably the biggest part in pulling of my heartstrings in almost making me cry or feeling extremely tense. The episodes I want to specifically point out are 116, 130 and 131 for Gon’s voice actor, as she made me feel either fear to the point where I was holding my breath or tense to the point were I was constantly getting chills down my spine. The voice for Killua makes him extremely likable (in my opinion), and had some influence in him being my favorite character in all of anime. 
Sound- 9.5/10: I really love the ost for this show as it further strengthened the emotional and tense scenes, especially in the Chimera Ant Arc. There are a few flaws, which I did not mind, for example there were one or two scenes where the music didn’t necessarily fit the mood of the scene, like the Kurapika vs Uvo fight scene. Also the opening never changed for the entire series, but the music was good so I did not mind at all. 
Characters- 9/10: This show have some of my favorite characters from all of anime, the only reason why it doesn’t get a perfect score would be because there are a bit too many characters (like the introduction of the Zodiacs in the last arc was not long enough for me to feel anything for these characters). A simple explanation can be that the manga is not done (currently in hiatus) and the anime concluded with the story of Gon, at least from my perspective (Gon can potentially come back in the manga but I do not know). The main cast is excellent and in my opinion there are no definitive main protagonist. This is my assumption because while the story does follow Gon and Killua for most of the anime, the York New City Arc put Kurapika in the spotlight. The only main character that did not get a fair amount of screen time was Leorio, but he is very likable in the times he is present. The changes in the other three protagonists were excellent, I do not want to say development (and I want to limit the spoilers), but the changes that the characters go through makes you feel for the characters and get invested in their adventure. The initial impression of the main protagonists, including Leorio, is very different from how you feel about them as you go through the show.
The antagonists were probably my favorite in all of the anime I’ve watched, especially Meruem and the Chimera Ants. My initial thoughts of these ants were nowhere close to what I thought of them by the conclusion of the arc. Hisoka, while not my favorite, is very intriguing. While I often hear about how poor of an antagonist Genthru is, I believe it is because he is compared to the other antagonist in this story. I believe that he is the perfect antagonist for that arc, without saying any spoiler keep in mind he is the antagonist of the GREED Island arc. The Phantom Troupe is also very fascinating as I believe that the York New City Arc is only the tip of the iceberg in their development.
I haven’t even touched on the other side characters that played a vital role in the show. They are great and crucial in the way they help shape either the protagonists and the antagonists. Lastly, the narrator is a point of division in the fact that either you like his role or feel that is overused. While I felt that his role was necessary, a lot of people feel that he plays too large of a role.
Enjoyment- 10+/10: To me a 10/10 isn’t enough to show how much I enjoyed the anime. Despite the fact that it was my second watch, I had little issues in binging the show as I consistently watch 15 episodes in a day when I had the time. While after my first watch it wasn’t my favorite show, I kept coming back to it, often watching youtube videos about Hunter x Hunter. During my rewatching of the show I realized how much I loved this show and led to me believing that this is my favorite show.
Overall- 10/10
Conclusion: I do not know if my review (if it can even be called a review), can show how much I love this show. I believe this is a show that you should experience at least once. This is completely my own opinion and obviously there are others that will disagree, but I believe there will be at least one thing that you will enjoy from watching this show. I want to leave a quote from this show that I feel best illustrates what this show is about (so potential SPOILERS):
“You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want.”",10

                Overrated, but not by much. 
HxH 2011 has evolved over the last decade from somewhat of a cult classic, to #3 on MAL with a 9.11 and top 25 in popularity. The reviews from 4-5 years ago that claim this show to be under appreciated couldn't be further from the truth in 2019. It boasts some of the best-selling (and best looking in my opinion) merch at anime conventions and is CONSTANTLY being recommended to new anime watchers. I'll admit, I held out on this show for a long time just so I could wait for a good time to binge watch all 148 episodes.
                  
I was instantly impressed. It wasn't too slow like other shounen anime, and the characters that it introduced had mystery and charm. In fact, the best part about HxH is its characters. I got even more into the show during the Spiders arc. Again, the show's characters were the driving force. The Greed Island arc was a bit less enjoyable for me but still good. But then...
Just about half way through the show...the largest arc begins. The Chimera Ant arc. This arc was painfully slow compared to the previous pacing which I had grown accustomed to. But the worst part was it introduced a slew of characters who I cared nothing for. Now introducing characters isn't a bad thing, but introducing the most OP characters to appear on-screen thus far by having them be birthed by another random character who you met a few episodes ago was awful. This arc spans about half the show, but it felt much longer. And its conclusion is sp sub par it hurts. 
I was practically cheering when it finally ended and we got back to characters I actually gave a shit about for the last dozen episodes or so. These last finishing episodes were good and introduced a major discovery about the world which explains why the Chimera Ants were so strong. However, this episode seemed like it should have launched the series into the beginning of a 500+ episode adventure with Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio getting stronger and traveling the world.
Instead the show just ends. That's it. It's over. No conclusion. And also no development for the characters. This show was good, but a disappointment. I am aware a lot of this can be blamed on the Manga being on hiatus about 50% of the time. And even the creator has addressed concerns he might die before he even finishes the story; saying, “Sometimes I’m not sure which will expire first, the series or me.”
TLDR: A show with great characters and great potential that has no conclusion and a mediocre arc that takes up half the episodes.",7

                Review up to episode 77. Will edit as I watch more.
PROPER MENTALITY
This is the remake of a cult shonen show from 1999, which still remains as a top favourite for thousands of people who followed it through the years. It was taken out of the spotlight as soon as Naruto and Bleach came around because its merits were always hinted, the artwork was very weak (manga included), and the story was left incomplete. But for many it is still a much superior show for its kind, since it is not direct in its themes and definitely not one of the same shonen stuff. Let’s start
                  by clarifying some things regarding remakes.
1. Why make a remake instead of continuing the story from where it stopped in the OVAs?
Most of the younger viewers will not dare to watch the original, because of the abysmal difference in the animation quality. Instead of making a dozen episodes that will AGAIN end in the middle of nowhere and be about characters most won’t know or care for after all these years, they (wisely) decided to reboot it and give the mangaka time to continue and (hopefully) end the story by the time the anime catches up to it. Nothing bad here.
2. The new animation is worse because it is brighter and cheerier, and looks less serious.
This is a plain case of personal taste. Back in 1999 the colouring was still done by hand and for that the colours were darker and the outlines rougher by default. What did people expect, to be hand-drawn dark, depressive, and edgy in our age and time? It is kinda logical that it will be drawn and coloured with computers, which means the result we have today. If you prefer the retro style, then there is nothing that can be done about it. The only problem I found is how they censored a few really gory scenes but that is all. It is otherwise animated by Studio Madhouse which is the king when it comes to tv shows and definitely has a far bigger budget and experience that the previous one, Nippon Animation. I have no problem with their work and I view it in the same way I view the remake of Full Metal Alchemist. If you prefer a brighter coloured version, with a bit more cheerful people, and a lot more faithful adaptation, then you will like it more than the older version. If not, ok, you won’t, you can’t please everybody.
3. The story is worse because it removes a lot of scenes which were important in flavouring the characters of the original.
The pacing of the original story was even for its time very slow to the most part and had lots of fillers. It was completely unimpressive for the impatient audience; me included as I was bored with it halfway. So just imagine what would have happened if they had kept every single scene in it. Viewers today are getting fed up far easier than a decade ago and thus the story would actually feel worse. As for the drier feeling of the characters because the scenes are removed and the pacing goes too fast to get to feel their motivation, I must protest. It’s a 100+ episode show, it has plenty of time to flesh out its characters along the way instead of doing it right away and not leaving anything for later. This is one of the reasons even a bigshot like One Piece loses its charm as it goes on. As for all the secondary characters who feel completely forgettable this way, HEY THEY ARE ONE EPISODE CHARACTERS! I kept reading how Gon’s aunt and the captain of the ship were far more realistic and interesting in the older version. Oh that is so nice; and then the episode ends and you never see them again. So do you think it would be wise in our days to spend entire episodes in fleshing out one-time characters? I think not; only the major ones are important and only they deserve to be fleshed out along the way. Unless of course you are fans of that travesty of characterization you encounter in shows such as Naruto and Bleach.
SCRIPT
I was not thrilled when I found out the director of the show would be Koujina Hiroshi. He has a lukewarm roster (Grenadier, Kiba, Nougami Neuro, Rainbow) and for a show so famous they could definitely have found someone with more interesting titles and experience to handle things. You can easily find many sloppy scenes and I can only blame the director for that. But it’s not like I hate it either; I just found it not as professional as it deserved.
The basic story is simple in overall, and trust me when I say it will not improve much. It never feels too epic and blood boiling. This does not make the show boring but rather unimpressive for those who expect major fights and complexity.
- The first arc (episodes 1 to 20) is about the adventure of the main heroes, as they try to pass a dangerous line of challenges in order to be given the title of Hunter, someone who can do all sorts of dangerous professions and is considered an elite agent. Each one of them wants to be a Hunter for different reasons; one is looking for his father, another to protect the world from threats, and a third just to get rich. Very basic stuff and eventually full of needless bull. You will facepalm at how pointless most of these challenges are after you realize that they do not reward skill but rather survival. That means, it’s fine as long as you can stay alive long enough (and preferably using Nen powers). Since the heroes have the typical uncanny shounen durability of withstanding everything, they mostly breeze through the challenges, while everybody else is thrown out with a few punches. Some of the situations will be rather interesting but in all, this arc serves mostly as introduction to the characters than anything else.
Score: 7/10
- The second arc (episodes 21 to 25) is about one of the heroes being mistreated by his family and the rest going for a house visit. Being the dangerous place it is, they need to cross a line of dangerous challenges until they manage to find him. So yes, all they want is to see their friend again and so risk their lives numerous times just for that. Not exactly exciting, is it? It is less exciting when you realize that they barely fight anyone important in that place before their friend is allowed to go see them. A very short arc where they have a hard time getting through the main gate and the butlers, and then it is all over. This arc serves to flesh out one of the characters and even that not by much.
Score: 6/10
- The third arc (episodes 26 to 36) is about the heroes taking part in a fighting tournament (yeah, here we go again) as means to improve their fighting skills. Get ready for boring long training sessions as well as practical applications during duels. It sure makes the whole Hunter exam to feel like it was there for kicks. I mean, if a Hunter is supposed to be an elite agent, anyone who hopes to pass should already be someone with lots of experience. But no, turns out that it was just rewarding survival and every person who passes needs to become strong AFTER he is nominated as an elite agent. Weird huh? Feels like the story escalates in reverse, instead of getting more epic along the way? Trust me, it gets worse later. In the meantime, this is the part they introduce Nen, which is this show’s version of ki/reiatsu/chakra/power level/whatever. Unlike most versions where it is used as a single statistic through elements or volume, over here it is seen as four different aspects of the same principle (defence, attack, cancel, and willpower). This makes it feel somewhat more variant than simply say “My icicle attack is powerful but your weak flame shield blocks it” kind of Pokemon-style battles. They also introduce the six character classes to further make the whole thing feel like a videogame. This arc serves to establish superpowers based on a person’s characterization, and has a few interesting fights. Half the time though it’s just a long preachy training session.
Score: 7/10
- The fourth arc (episodes 37 to 58) is about an underground auction where Gon tries to raise money in order to find his father by… arm-wresting. Isn’t it weird how we went from fighting in a tournament to that? Anyways, it is actually more about his pal Kurapika getting all crazy and hunting a bunch of super killers who wiped out his family (this is something Kishimoto stole in Naruto with Sakuke and his Uchiha clan). It is by far the most brutal arc yet and has some extremely well done battles in it. It fleshes out Kurapika and several secondary characters considerably, and is very suspenseful.
Score: 9/10
- The fifth arc (episodes 59 to 75) is about the characters hunting cards inside a videogame that can kill them. And yes, you are free to make all the Sword Art Online and Yugioh jokes you like, because the story downgraded further from arm-wrestling to playing videogames. It is rather disappointing after the amazing previous arc, since it now feels like the whole show was sort of a prelude to promoting videogames to kids. I mean the Nen system is pretty much a basic RPG statistics screen and here is where it shows better than ever. Another disappointing element is how the surviving villains from the previous arc seem to just be in this one for kicks. The whole revenge thing is completely gone and they degraded to cartoony bad guys. Also the new villains of this arc simply lack charisma and are forgettable. Anyways, this whole arc is basically playing a bunch of deadly games and doing some really risky gambling here and there but nothing overall amazing.
Score: 7/10
- The sixth arc (currently airing) is about the characters hunting bugs. Yes, we moved from playing videogames to hunting bugs! Ok, actually these bugs are huge, powerful, and extremely deadly. And I mean that; they kill half of the secondary characters of this show. There is a lot of death and violence in this arc but again the villains lack charisma. Furthermore, it feels like the whole thing is ideas stolen from Dragonball, as the king of the bugs is a Cell imitation and his minions behave like those of King Picolo.
Score: 8/10
Do yourselves a favour and never expect much out of the plot. All the objectives are weak and there only as plot devises; and even those are presented poorly. Kurapika’s goal is forgotten, Leorio never has a purpose in the whole series, and Gon’s father is a total troll. I mean, really, he keeps giving missions to his son from afar with the promise of finding him but he keeps fooling him to keep looking. Yes, it is an excuse for Gon to continue becoming stronger but it is still one big troll.
CAST
Try to focus on the character traits, the main attraction of the series, as well as how each one uses his special skills to overcome a challenge. And by skills don’t try to imagine fire breathing, creating copies of yourself, or flying. The powers in the show are far more basic and down to earth that that, such as heightened senses, use of psychology, and detective deduction procedure. The main hero for example uses a fishing rod as his main weapon. Sounds silly but he does all sorts of sneaky attacks with it by trying to outsmart the enemy with a lure and then hook him when he doesn’t expect it. So unlike most shonens, it is not mostly about raw power and delinquents blowing up mountains with their glowing aura, but brains and strategy. The ways they find to overcome a challenge are tactical and cunning.
Of course for the same reason it is far from cool. Since the average shonen fan would expect amazing action, all this talking, plotting, and back stabbing will surely feel dull and will make many to be bored fast if they only want action. Those who manage to focus on the tactical part though will find it to be a far more elaborate and mature specimen than your silly average action show.
- It is not about dumb teenagers with superpowers kicking the crap out of each other.
- It is never trying to impress you with pseudo-romance, fan service, or poser special attacks.
- It seems to have the usual theme of trust and teamwork all shounens share and up to a point they indeed overcome most challenges based on that. At the same time though, each character is far more selfish that those in similar shows and thus it is quite easy to get mad with something and leave the team to go seek some crazy thing on his own. Thus you get far more unstable heroes, who don’t always blindly follow the group leader.
- At the same time the villains are not generic evil dudes who hate everything and plot amongst each other. You see they care and are willing to risk their lives to help their comrades.
- It is also one of the very few rare cases where there isn’t a single girl following the dudes around just for the heck of it. It’s only the males doing all the work as always, so who needs those useless token chicks that exist only for kiddie romances and fan service? To hell with them, this is a man’s world. Imagine how cool it is in the second arc where they plan to save a strong boy who has killed dozens of people without feeling a thing instead of some frail damsel in distress who always nags and cries. Or in the fourth where you literally have a female agent who dies without even making use of her powers. That stuff are one of a kind.
It is true though that its merits are hard to spot, since it is subtle with the presentation. The violence is quite childish in the first two arcs and the mental breakdowns of the characters are done in a very light manner when they would easily be far cooler if they were looking crazier. The characters also follow the typical shonen silliness of yelling each others’ names all the time, even in situations where they don’t need to, as if they don’t want the audience to forget how they are called. They also do that annoying thing of explaining their strategies to the enemy, as if the audience is too dumb to get it. It is very commonplace as an exposition method in shonen but it still feels dumb to see it happening. Internal monologues or a narrator would feel much more natural than this mess. The faster pace also makes the duration of a dramatic event to last too little for you to find the time to get into the proper mood, and thus its gravity goes unnoticed by most. This is again something I can only blame the director for, as others could have done much more vivid work with what they had.
Another indirect problem which prevents the show from becoming a smash hit is that it doesn’t have a gazillion immortal characters and most mysteries are answered rather fast. Unlike the so called Big Three of shonen, there is very little to talk about what may happen in the future or how the characters may develop later on, or even to have a huge variety of archetypes to choose your favourite from. That sort of crap are what made the Big Three so damn famous, even if in all honesty they are just shallow excuses for hyping caricatures that eventually don’t develop or have any important role in the show in general. HxH doesn’t go for that bait; it has a rather small cast and several of the characters die soon after they are introduced. It is what again makes it feel superior as it is not trying to cater everybody’s tastes and never promises things it will never deliver a decade later.
LEGACY
It is a very good shonen and I recommend it. It is by all means not a serious or complicating story, as it is just some youths trying to win in tournaments and play videogames. Each character is basically a bold stereotype (the idealist, the materialist, the kind one, etc) yet the way they interact is both smart and doesn’t drag the most basic actions for 10 episodes.
Furthermore it is interesting to see how many of its ideas were later on copied by Naruto, so in a way it partially deserves the credit THAT silly ninja show got, which otherwise has nothing to do with ninjas and went under when it was all about Gaysuke. And anyways, all modern shonen are now all shit, One Piece included (animation is a joke and pacing is a snail). It is a great way for younger anime fans to see how more mature a decade old shonen was and how shitty all recent ones are (I am looking at you trollish Bleach, babish Fairy Tail, borish Ao no Exorcist, pissish Beelzebub, aimleish Toriko, coocooish Hitman Reborn, haremish Index, as well as all the rest of you). It is also a proper remake and not a lulz DBKai dried up re-airing with lesser context and incomplete story.
Despite my positive words about it, I must clarify that it is not a masterpiece. It is supposed to be for kids and has lots of childish violence even when it involves mass deaths of people, both benevolent and innocent (it’s not just generic evil henchmen that die). Hundreds of people are constantly dying in cartoony yet still horrible ways; it looks weird. Thus most situations feel too silly no matter how dangerous they appear to be and that takes out a lot out of the suspense the anime COULD have if it was more graphical in its violence. But it’s not like it is holding back a lot either, since each arc get progressively more mature and violent than the previous ones.
And now for some excused scorings.

- Ging Freecss
Best shounen anime I've watched (which doesn't mean too much since I never watch long shounen). When I first saw the length of this show, I didn't think I would ever watch it. My siblings are obsessed with it though, so I thought I'd give it a shot.
Split into multiple arcs, Hunter x Hunter includes many different components of human nature, tackled in a light-hearted manner. Friendship, hatred, promises, life, humanity, human will-power, strength, love. These themes are very justice-oriented, but I think it'd appeal to a large
                  audience. I preferred some arcs more than others, but each arc in HxH took an appropriate amount of episodes to finish. HxH (2011) was reanimated over a decade ago, but the art was impressive. I could probably find that the art for HxH more well-animated than some shows I can find in 2016. I don't remember much about the soundtrack, but there was this one echoing drum soundtrack repeated during suspenseful scenes. The reason I liked this part of the soundtrack so much was that despite having a musical background, I couldn't predict the rhythm for when the next drum would hit. I thought this was a mistake in the soundtrack; I vaguely remember placing my finger on my table to tap my finger against the desk to count the next drum beat. The suspense that the drum gave me was perfect for the scenes in HxH; it made me anxious. The opening for the first arc is super catchy too.
In each arc of the show, enough story-telling is given to almost all the characters. It brings the audience to not root for one side, but just to love all of the characters. Gon is a cheerful boy with incredible potential as a Hunter. His friendship with Killua is very wholesome, and they fight many obstacles together. The Zoldyck family is awesome. The Phantom Troupe is so cold. In a good way.
I loved this show. The kickass moments, the incredible story, and the funny moments in HxH that made me laugh all come together to make me give this show such a high rating.",10

                DAICHI O FUMISHIMETE...
OK in short this is an amazing anime. One of my favourites. 
STORY is a 10 because you will see once you get to the Chimera Ant Arc. The story isn't finished, but at the pace it's at right now, it keeps its 10.
ART is great and so I give it a 10. The characters look really well designed, etc.
SOUND is 10 because DEPARTURE, HYORI ITTAI, HUNTING FOR YOUR DREAM
CHARACTER is 10 because WAIT TILL YOU GET TO THE CHIMERA ANT ARC and I also found the Phantom Troupe really interesting and how every episode has different characters but they don't seem left
                  out of screen-time (apart from Kurapika who WILL be getting the spotlight in the Dark Continent arc so this keeps its 10).
ENJOYMENT is 10 because this anime is just really fun to watch, I don't know how to put it honestly...
OVERALL is 10 because I LOVE IT",10

                Hunter x Hunter (2011) is one of those unique gems of a Shounen in my opinion. It has the traditional features of the genre but at the same time is very deep in many ways and does a really good job of hitting both sides of the spectrum. I'll expand on that in the following
At first glance its very straight forward with Gon wanting to become a hunter to find his father, which remains the general goal throughout. As the story moves along we get introduced to new characters and they themselves end up having a back story as to what made them the way
                  they are and goals they have. Some more-so than others of course but all the while never really truly drifting from Gon. Through this these characters really grow into stand alone ""mains"" in their own way. Most obvious would be Kurapika and his ties with the Phantom Troupe. I've seen things like Yuu Yuu Hakusho where the main quartet has some depth but this show took it to a new level. I would be all for a few OVA's or short series. One for each ""mini story"" thats in the show and while I doubt that will happen I think that's a defining quality of the show.
Character story is not the only thing this show does a notch or two above the rest. Development is also well done here. Most notably here would be Gon and Killua. There is no doubt that those two have grown exponentially throughout the show in all aspects but the watcher is subtlety reminded that they are still indeed kids between 10 and 13 with the occasional reversion into child-like behavior or humor between the two. Which happen to be some of the best comedy in the show for me. Supporting characters are also not exactly left out here and most of the more frequent characters do get more polish. Good example of this would be Wing, you might forget his name but youll always remember he was at Celestial Tower.
As if all that wasn't enough the system of Nen itself is extremely complex. Definitely not like anything I experienced before in this sort of genre and the fact that there are the specializations where people fall into based on the type of person they were and that in itself gave them insight to their strengths and weaknesses was like icing on the cake for me. I really appreciate the depth here.
Lastly I'll touch on what I meant by spectrum in the beginning. I know the Phantom Troupe has done some not so cool things. I also know most of the Ants are not the best individuals but you know.... We get to see a small glimpse of the other side of the spectrum to a degree that's rarely seen in my opinion.
Sure there's plenty of instances like Danzo's or Madara from Naruto where the evil kind of subsides for a minute and you see some good intent behind their morphed way of doing things but for me this show took it to a whole different level. We get to see that pretty much all of the Phantom Troupe that spent more than fifteen minutes on screen was a decent person somewhere in their hearts and not just by some ""Goodbye world"" speech. Whether it was something like Nobunaga lashing out at Feitan individually or whether it was one portion of the Phantom Troupe going against another portion because they were split on viewpoints and how to handle a situation.
All around, Hunter x Hunter (2011) is really one of those gems that you don't see very often no matter the genre. If you have time, and haven't seen it yet, please sit through this show. I promise you won't regret it. 
That does it for this review. This one is extremely long but there's reasons for that. I hope it was an enjoyable read for whoever made it through.
P.S.
If you are wondering if you should watch the original Hunter x Hunter before this... Let me say that by all means you can do that but really, the 2011 version has everything the 1999 version has and so, so much more. If you just want to watch for the story you can safely pass on the original and the Greed Island OVAs. If you are one of those who really pay attention to the animation, sound or voice and want to watch to see the difference in the decade that passed from the two airings than by all means watch both.",10

                For me this anime didn't hook me right away as many have done in the past and after ten episodes i stopped watching it...
But then one day a few months later i decided to keep watching since i'd ran out of other things to watch and i remembered liking this well enough and it boasted such a high rating so i thought i might give it another go.
Anyway, after watching another few episodes it just kept getting better and better and turned into what i'd say is the best anime i've ever watched.
It may not hook you straight away, but i don't think that's the
                  point or style they were going for with this one. 
Its a little more like one piece to how it just gets better and better the more you watch, with one piece not having the most interesting start either. 
Or like one punch man as well which didn't hook me until about episode 5.
Anyway i'd highly recommend giving this one a go if your looking for a great story to invest in.
This anime is one of a kind.

                An almost unbeatable anime
Every time I think about this show I get proper anime goosebumps. Goosebumps comparable to the ones you get when you hear the opening theme to the first season of One Piece for the first time in ages. It’s like I become swarmed by member berries and I’m unwaveringly asked if I remember every scene in every story and the banality of reality is a distant memory........
Aaaaaanyway, Hunter x Hunter. Firstly, a round of applause is due for its very original, unless I am proven wrong, approach to music. At the time of this review I’m a drummer of 15 years and
                  nothing gets me quite as excited as when I hear the drums of Hunter x Hunter. It’s like my body is a bed of coal and this music is the fire-lighter that starts the BBQ. So simple, so effective, so brilliant.
Now the animation. It is everything it needs to be. Where it needs to focus on a characters ability or technique, it absolutely nails it. Where is needs to focus on emotion of the scene, it does it even better. Fluid, colourful and full or character.
And now the story, the glorious story. Setting the character building to one side, it’s flawless. Every person I speak to has a different arc as their favourite. I believe that to be a true reflection of a very well written and directed anime.
And the character development. Personally, there is not a single anime that does it better. Quite frankly, In the penultimate arc, the character development is nothing short of mind blowing. Initially, you find you are watching a pointless element to a story only to find when you come out the other end, you have bore witness to quite possibly the most original way to develop a character you will ever see. It is simply superb.
There is very little that can compare to this anime. I urge anyone yet to delve into this to do it without hesitation and be rewarded with quite possibly the greatest anime ever produced.",9
"
                The most appropriate word to describe hunter x hunter is ""refreshing"". It is a shonen anime unlike any other shonen I've seen. It not only deviates from the stereotypical layout found in every shonen anime, it completely defies all that. It is truly an anomaly in the world of anime which let's face it is filled to the brim with clichés, run of the mill tropes and predictable storyline. That is not to say it doesn't have flaws. It has some major ones but what truly sets it apart is that unlike other shows of the same genre hxh does a decent job of overcoming
                  those flaws. 
For me the best thing about hunter x hunter isn't the great story or the diverse and interesting characters. The best part is how it never follows the universal anime trope of the protagonist magically overcoming any and all odds, defeating everyone and generally being invincible. Instead it focuses more on the characters themselves meticulously defining them through their adventure's and developing them. The protagonist's willpower never helps him beat others who are clearly stronger than him just Couse someone believes in him or he has to do something and can't afford to die!!
The story of hxh is basically a fantasy set in the future. A world where myth and magic live side by side with technology and modern civilization. The first 20 episodes or so are slow, dull and frankly horrible. But bear with the first arc and I guarantee you you'll fall in love with it. The pacing is uneven throughout the series constituting a major drawback. It goes from slow to rapid to slow quite a few times. The plot points are nudged along by a third person narrative and the writing and world building are both top notch. Overall its pretty darn good.
The art and sound are both commendable as well. Being a Madhouse production its expected but comes as a pleasant surprise.For a 148 episode show not only is the animation consistently good it gets better as the series progresses. The show though changes the intro every arc it doesn't however change the song. As for the outro there are three songs all of which are equally good. Within the episodes it has some very good orchestral soundtracks though they're a little stretched because of the number of episodes.
The characters in hxh are in a way both gratifying and disappointing. There are almost no bad characters in the show and even the side characters are well developed and detailed thanks to the shows length. But it doesn't really have many exceptional characters either. Most of them fall in the ""decent"" category. For a show with such a large cast that is truly disappointing. The villains on the other hand fulfil every criteria. They're smart, menacing, nuanced and over all very complex. You think you understand them but then they go do something you wouldn't dream they would do.
Overall despite its flaws I found hxh to be an incredibly enjoyable and smart fantasy/action anime complete with great animation, music, story and characters. It'll suck you in and hold you enraptured. Though it drags out the finales that is only a minor point. It will continuously surprise you with the tone shift and revelations. It somehow manages to be both charming and gritty. For me without a doubt its much better than full metal alchemist brotherhood.",9

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
Hunter x Hunter was one of those shounen anime that I dropped back in the day after a few episodes because it was clear that it was just... yet another shallow shounen anime, with awful worldbuilding and terrible pacing, merely a focus on hype and action without much thought about stuff.
I decided to pick it up this year, both the 1999 and 2011 versions, to see if my hunch was right, and boy I was disappointed to see it was. This review is on the 2011 anime, which I consider particularly bad and a step down from the 1999 anime, which wasn't
                  that great to begin with.
Artwork & Sound
---------------------
Being a high budget shounen anime, there's no denying that this show has superb artwork, animation and sound design. Action and fight scenes all look amazing, while in the 1999 version, the animation ranged from okay to laughably bad, so there's a massive improvement there and credit is due. 
However, anyone who has watched the 1999 version before would have to point out one of the biggest issues with the 2011 version - the color palette. The 1999 version tends to be extremely dark and gritty, which serves very well to give the audience a sense of threat and danger coming from this large, mysterious world. 
Meanwhile the 2011 version has a more colorful palette with overall brighter colours, which does not fit the setting at all, as people get murdered on screen and the only cue we get that this is a dangerous situation, is the superb sound design, which cannot carry the sense of dread and danger the audience should be feeling on its own.
A notable example of this is during the Hunter Exam arc, specifically the part where Gon is trying to steal Hisoka's badge. In the 1999 version, the scene takes place during night time, with most of the screen being obscured by darkness, helping the audience relate to the fear Gon would be feeling in that situation. Meanwhile, in the 2011, it takes place in the daytime, with bright green trees and beige rocks dominating the scene, undermining the sense of fear completely.
Story & Pacing
------------------
MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD
The story and worldbuilding are by far the largest weakness of Hunter x Hunter. They're honestly terrible, just completely nonsensical. The story revolves around Gon, a boy who wants to become a Hunter in order to meet his father, who has challenged Gon to find him... and then eventually he just kinda shows up and is like ""hey Gon what's up"", defeating the whole premise of the show.
For more examples, the entire Greed Island arc was 100% pointless, far too long and convoluted. It ultimately made no difference to the plot, it was just a fairly weak training arc. Meanwhile, the Hunter Exam arc, which serves as the series' foundational world-building, is kinda rushed through, specially compared to the 1999 version, and as a result we really don't get to know much about the world, its inhabitants, its mechanics, etc.
Another example of shoddy storywriting is Nen, the magical energy inside humans that allows them to accomplish supernatural feats. It's a top secret that only a select few know about - f.e. apparently Kilua's assassin family never even told him about it, it's that much of a secret - and then one day it's introduced in the show at roughly the 1/4 mark. From that point on everyone uses Nen, in increasingly quirky and unbelievable ways. It's the world's worst kept secret, and it takes very minimal thought to understand how little sense it makes from a worldbuilding PoV.
There's many pacing problems, which are very evident when compared to the 1999 version. The Hunter Exam arc scene I mentioned above for example - in the 2011, Gon just kind of sleeps Hisoka's punch off, acts weird for a few minutes, then all is well again. We do not get the sense of frustration and psychological turmoil that Gon experiences in this situation, because there's simply no time for it.
The pacing problems just keep getting exacerbated past the Greed Island arc, which is where the 1999 version left off at. The Chimera Ant arc lasts for what felt like 200 episodes, with super dragged out episodes that do not advance the plot one bit. The arc in general feels mostly meaningless, and then when it's over we get 10 episodes of the Chairman Election arc to wrap everything up at lightspeed pace.
Characters
-------------
MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD
The biggest victim of the show's awful pacing are its characters, and mostly the side characters.
Another one of the 1999 version's strong points is its attention to detail to minor characters. Even characters that are only around for 1 scene or 1 episode at most tend to have individual personalities, they tend to exhibit some sense of ulterior motive, they feel like living parts of the world. The 2011 version doesn't have time for that - all characters beyond the main cast and the villain of the day are simply NPCs, with a simple one-liner to help push the plot forward and nothing else to their name.
But minor side characters are not the only ones affected by this, by any means. More important characters, such as Chairman Netero, Hisoka, the Phantom Troupe members, etc have significantly diminished roles in the 2011 version and all suffer for it, being mostly 1-dimensional characters with very little personality for a very big part of the show.
To give an example of how bad this issue gets, you have the character of Kite. One of Gon's father's closest friends and pupil, who was the one that spurred Gon to become a Hunter, and some sort of father figure and teacher for Gon. He is in the show for a mind-boggling 9 episodes before he dies, and his death is supposed to be this shocking event that psychologically destroys Gon to the point of becoming suicidal... after knowing him for 9 episodes, in a show that had ran for 85 episodes already at the time, a trivial amount of time.
The only redeeming quality to all of this are Killua and Kurapica. Another way to put it is that as long as Gon is not involved, the show is decent. They have incredible depth as characters, and their character arcs are actually intertwined with the world in general in a sensible way, unlike Gon and his entire character arc which is mostly stand-alone and largely makes no sense.
Summary
-----------
Honestly I've used a lot of words to say that this show is bad. And it is. There's some good to it, but it's largely not worth it, suffering through painfully bad pacing and awful worldbuilding for the few good moments there.
If you do decide to watch this show, I recommend that you start with the 1999 version to get a glimpse of some of its good parts at least, because most of them aren't there anymore in the 2011 version. I'd also recommend that you fast forward through the Greed Island and Chimera Ant arcs because they have particularly bad pacing compared to the rest of the show.
I've heard that as of late the manga has focused mostly on Kurapika, and I sincerely hope that continues to be the case and one day we get a sequel based on that arc with better pacing, because that legitimately could be interesting. That's about all the positivity I could muster for this show.",4
"
                Have you ever watched an anime you loved but after finishing it you weren't sure why? For me, that anime is Hunter X Hunter.
I turned my brain off almost the entire time I watched Hunter X Hunter. I was just in it for the dope fights and villains, often enjoying myself to the extent that I completely missed the genius of Togashi's writing. But that's the beauty of great writing. You don't always have to fully understand it to fully enjoy its merits. You don't have to realise Chrollo is a nihilist with an identity crisis to be in awe of his stage presence. The
                  same way you don't need to understand that the Chimera Ant arc is about human hypocrisy in order to fall in love with the sensational fights. But I will say this; after analysing it a little, I loved it even more.
In conclusion, Hunter X Hunter is a purely enjoyable shounen anime you can only appreciate more as you better understand it. And that's why Hunter X Hunter is one of my favourite anime of all time.",9

                Waring: This review may contain minor spoilers about the plot of Hunter X Hunter(2011) 
This is one of my favorite anime, it has tons of ups and downs, but sadly it hasn't been finished yet. This is only a review on everything through the 13th Hunter Chairman Election Arc, because as of now that is all that is out.
 Lets start with the music, which is amazing. Some of my favorite songs from the soundtrack are ""Hunting for Your Dream"", ""All I Need is Money"",  and ""Hisoka's Theme"" which are just a small portion of the great music in this show. It has a
                  great style, and portrays each scene in a unique way. Each character has a unique feel that meshes well with the others and the world.
The story is a big melting pot, and it has many different genres. The first arc it a typical introduction arc, the second is a training arc, the third is where all the characters reconvene and it starts getting more story heavy, the fourth is an isekai adventure, the fifth is the longest and has so many good moments and character development, but sadly I cant talk about most of it without major spoilers, and the sixth wraps up the loose ends of the previous arc. Overall my favorite was Arc 5 because of how plot heavy it was, and it was really what pushed forward most of the character development.
This is a really enjoyable anime, but if you don't typically watch anime you may have a hard time with how long the show is. It has many lovable moments, which is what made it one of my favorite anime of all time. I think anyone who likes adventure, would like this anime. Everything about it was just so memorable, and I don't think I will forget anything about it anytime soon.",10
"
                There may be some minor spoilers ahead but I’ll try not to spoil anything important.
STORY: 9
I love the story of this anime. It really captured me, usually I take quite a long time to watch anime, however I got really into this one and ended finishing it in 6 days. I think Madhouse did an incredible job with the pacing. The only reason I didn’t give this a 10/10 is because I think the Chimera Ant Arc is long, yes it probably needs to be that long for it to work, but I don’t like how long it is.
ART: 10 
It’s made by Madhouse, so
                  what should you expect? I love the art in this anime as well. It’s just so nice to watch, and the animation is also done incredibly well. There’s not much else to say really.
SOUND: 10
Again, I don’t really know what to say here other than I think it’s incredible.
CHARACTERS: 8
I do really like the characters in this anime, the only reason this section is the lowest for me is the two main characters, Gon and Killua. I don’t dislike them, but I also don’t like them. I think the Hunter Exam Arc was setting the anime up to have four lead characters, where it does, but only in certain arcs. I think the anime is better when it includes Kurapika and Leorio. Going away from the main characters, my only other complaint is Mereum’s character development. He started of with a cold personality, but as the Arc went on he became someone who plays board games. I would have loved to see him stay how he was when he was introduced.
ENJOYMENT: 10
My overall enjoyment of this anime was extremely high. It was an incredibly fun thing to watch and I will definitely be watching it again, at some point. 
OVERALL: 9 
I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who hasn’t watched it. Also if you don’t know whether or not to watch this or the original, I would definitely say this one.",9

                Spoilers Alert
Spoilers Alert
Spoilers Alert
★ Story: 6 .
Inconsistency. Gon's mindless Ging-hunting. Both his parents abandoned him. As a proof of disinterest in his biological mother he said, ""Mito is my mom."" But for some strange reason he is curious about the man who fathered him and followed his dangerous footsteps as a hunter to track him down.... yeah makes sense! But I'll let that slip.
Two words: DAMN ANTS.
What's more to say? The show started out slowly and then it got REAL good as the characters and plot progressed... before finally taking a steep turn downhill washing off all the glory and fun in the early episodes.
                  The *building of Ant Chimera arc was abysmally paced, boring, illogical, an almost pointless torture to watch that I had to speed them up by x2. As if all the training in the heavens arena with Wings and green world with Biscuit never happened, the boys were cripplingly powerless against some baby ant chimeras that were just born days ago.
However that said, the ending of this arc was pretty neat with King and Komugi together. Some clear moral lessons slipped here and there. Just wished neko-Pitou didn't have to die as a villain. Such a shame. Unlike Pouf, she still had a bit of humanity in her. Nonetheless her regrettable death leaves a lesson; that with trickery and deceit even good potential allies can turn bad. I swear Pouf is the true villain there. On the flip side, he shows perspective on how even villains have someone they genuinely care about and want to protect. Pretty rich. We label others as evil when we don't share their morals and line of thought. We tend to forget that despite his crimes, Pouf harboured well intentions for the king just like the other royal guards - except in his own approach. Or so the anime tried to portray.. The fact remains, his actions are still selfish and clearly against his King's will. Deciding what is best for others is not a good thing. Giving them understanding and reasoning - through honesty and communication.. nothing beats that. Meruem, the chimera king who was supposed to take over the world seemed to understand this better than any other character in the anime. We could all apply this in parenting and relationships: to communicate with words and not one-sidedly decide what's best for the person you love.
★ Art: 9 .
Expressive art, great details, very fluid animation, great directing, effective closeup captures and film techniques.
★ Sound: 7 .
catchy OP/ED, impressive bg music placement- does the job but nothing remarkable, whole cast replaceable except for hisoka's unique voice actor.
★ Characters: 10 .
The main villains, the zoldycks and hisoka saved the show for me. They're the true appeal in this anime.
Gon. Everything conveniently revolved around him, he repeatedly received help from others despite his selfishness. In normal situation, this would've been very irritating; had he never admitted his mistakes and apologised. It's scarce to see a protagonist consecutively making gravely wrong decisions and admitting it. I find that very realistic and educational. On another note, I disagree with how in the first episodes the author chose to praise/reward Gon's neutrality in morality. Not having and acting on conscience is not exactly a good trait. As a wise quote says; silence in the face of injustice is siding with the oppressor. Gon not ever judging the bad in people is far from a commendable act. Lack of justice, passively and indiscriminately being nice (not making a testimony against the bullying on the ship for example).. is a poor message to pass to children. He never got in trouble befriending liars, cheaters, scammers, but in the real world, more often than not - you will. Yet the author decided to encourage passiveness and stupidity for the sake of being ""different"" from stereotypical shounen protagonists. In reality most people are already passive... nobody stands up for bullies, nobody cares for justice.. and nothing good comes from ignorance and blind positivity.
Killua. You just can't go wrong with this one. Smart, strong, cool, reasonable character with great character development and deep background story. I don't believe there's a single audience that hates this kid.
The other two ""main characters"" disappeared for more than half the show.
★ Enjoyment: 7 .
Some parts are legendary and then there's shit stain chore to watch. You'll be disappointed if you're hoping to see intellectual plot and logic in this anime as some have mis-advertised. But if you're on for a wild unexpected turn of events, by all means, you should watch this anime.
★ Impression: 10 .
Really leaves a mark. I decided to watch the 2011 after growing up with 1999 version aired on tv from my childhood. Really glad I came back and watch the series properly this time. With all my love and hate for the contents, I can proudly say for certain, this is not just another title I will forget - not for more decades to come!
★ Overall: 8 .
Loveable main villains. I already miss the lots.
My advice:
Skip/speed most of the ant arc if you're not into boredom, irritation and... nen-ducations all over again. Could've been a solid 10 if ant arc and flat-ending were executed much better.",8
"
                There was a huge amount of hype for this anime, so going into it I had huge expectations. I'm not gonna write a long review about all of the factors (story, art, character etc.), just a couple things that I liked and disliked about hxh.
The first episodes (1- ~80):
From the start to the end of the Greed Island arc, everything was great. The hunter exams, heaven's arena and especially the yorknew arc were 9s and 10s. Greed island toned it down to an 8 but it was still great nonetheless. Spectacular worldbuilding and characterisation got me invested into all of the main cast, my favourite
                  being Kurapika after the fight with Uvogin. Everyone was interesting and the display of the possibilities with nen allowed for an absurd amount of development and potential for all the characters in the show.
Chimera ant arc:
This is really a 'make it or break it' arc for everyone; you either love it or you hate it. I'm on the hate it side. When I saw the new version of the OP I thought ""sick, it's a filler arc about ants, lets get this over and done with so we can get back to Kurapika and Leorio"". Turns out this 'filler arc' lasted a whole lot more than 12 episodes and did nothing for the characters. The only useful thing I can think of that this 50+ episode arc achieved was a setup for Gon's recovery after the fight with Pitou, but that was resolved in a single, 12 episode arc by a character that defies everything that the show built up. There were some great fights in this arc but if you just want the fights you might as well go search them up on youtube.
The rest:
The next arcs are just kind of there. I liked how it set up Leorio's new power but due to the fact that the anime stopped, that doesn't really mean much. The election arc built some interesting characters and had a touching ending, but I couldn't really accept that this was the end because of the bad taste left in my mouth from the Chimera Ant arc.

                Where to start. This anime is the anime that got me out of the ""Naruto is the best anime ever and it will always be my number 1 stage"". For those of you that have been in that stage, you know what I'm talking about, and how hard it is to get out of it. But this anime is infinitely better than any other anime I have seen, even from a technical aspect. For example, arguably two of the greatest anime arcs ever are in this one masterpiece, that isn't even that long, let alone the fact that it isn't even completed. The development in
                  Chimera Ant is insanely good, and York New is one of the best plots and executions of any anime. Another point is the characters. Here we have two of the greatest side characters ever, including none other than Kurapika, the mold in which Sasuke was cast, and Killua, which I am sure you have heard enough about. It also includes three of the greatest villains of all time. This may be a hot take, but yes I believe Hisoka and Chrollo are also within the amount of character of Meruem. They might not be AS flawless of characters, but imo it's still damn close. Hisoka is attracted to power and potential, so the moral conflict of being ""attracted"" to this little boy, yet spending every waking moment attempting to suppress the urge to kill him right then and there. It's a magnificent character, let alone how creepy and powerful he is in his own regard. Chrollo, on the other hand, embodies ""the spider"". He IS the spider, which is why when we see him cry it isn't tears of sadness, but tears of loss for what is the spider. He doesn't feel his own emotions, instead he feels the troupe as a whole. That's what makes him such a deep and complex character I could spend days writing about, to no end. I saved the best for last. Meruem is one of the most complex characters I have ever seen in all of fiction period. He begins his life as a newborn, slaughtering his mother on his way out of her womb.He then goes around murdering women, children, the elderly, all to find something to fill his belly and satisfy his hunger. He colonizes and brainwashes an entire civilization, with a plan to purge them all. Then, he meats kaomogi. She is one of the smartest people in the world and the only pro player of a board game that Meruem just couldn't beat no matter how long he tried. Towards the end of the arc, a certain thing happens that makes Meruems mind click, more-so into human emotion, more than just that of an ant. His story directly parallels and reflects Gon's story beautifully even though they never met. While Meruem is becoming more human, Gon is slowly descending to how Meruem once was, a monster. Without spoiling too much, the Chimera Arc as a whole is literally the best development and story you will see, only rivaled by the York New arc. I could go on for hours about every arc, its flaws, and intricacies, but I think you get the idea. Hunter x Hunter is a one of a kind masterpiece.",10

                After my friends repeatedly telling me to watch Hunter x Hunter, I finally decided to give it a watch. Needless to say, I absolutely loved it! This review will contain mild spoilers (or 0 spoilers depending on what you consider spoilers)
Hunter X Hunter is an absolute masterpiece in my opinion. Throughout the series, we saw how Gon developed from a rookie to a decent level hunter. What's different about Hunter x Hunter is how they really show us his development. We can see that no matter how much he trains, there is always someone else who is maybe 100 times stronger than him. It kept
                  introducing new characters and developed them perfectly too. It's more realistic because of how difficult it is for Gon to become the strongest (Although that's not his goal particularly). 
If this were Naruto, with the same training, he would have achieved god level powers which, in my opinion is unrealistic. I rate Naruto highly too, but Hunter x Hunter has done this particular thing better than Naruto did. 
The penultimate arc was one of the best arcs I've ever watched. It kept me hooked throughout and I finished the final 71 episodes in just 4 days
It's a sad thing really, that this anime could not be completed due to the author being sick. He was doing a great job. I say this as a human to another human and as a fan, Get well soon Yoshihiro Togashi!",10
"
                Just completed this anime today.
There are not enough superlatives to fully describe my appreciation for this series. I am very late to the party so I am sure in terms of praise and analysis it's all been said before but I will mention the main thing that made this stand out for me.
Characters. The characters were so rich in depth. So much effort was put in to giving every character a real personality, even side characters who could just have been forgotten were given back stories and it made the whole world seem more real.
The character arcs were amazing, and it was a pleasure to
                  watch them on their respective journeys. The villains were as complex as the heroes, and that is probably one of the strongest elements I think. The fact that the villains were so interesting kept me intrigued. 
It made me laugh and cry and it wont be soon forgotten.",10
"
                I found a lot of mixed reviews so I decided I'd throw in my own two cents. *SLIGHT SPOILERS*
First of all, I'd like to say that if you're a fan of shounen but don't just want constant FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT this is the show for you. As someone who just finished the series, I confidently consider this a masterpiece.
STORY
The story might start out slow if not even a bit cliche at first, but if you want to truly enjoy it I say keep watching. It starts picking up quickly in the second arc and is truly at its best in the Yorknew arc.
ANIMATION
Top Notch. Never
                  dropped in quality. It is a Madhouse show after all.
MUSIC
The OST's are great but they can be a bit repetitive for some. I thought they fit the scenes very well.
CHARACTERS
Now, THIS is where HxH really shines. I'll start with the heroes:
Gon Freecs the main MC. He might seem like your typical happy go lucky shounen protagonist, but you soon come to realise that he's not some martyr looking to always save everyone and that his morals are questionable at best. He is inherently selfish in a way. On one hand, he doesn't bat an eye at the constant deaths occurring during the Hunter Exam, nor about the fact that his best friend is a mass murdering assassin, but when one of his loved ones dies he goes crazy (I'll talk about this in more detail later). Although he is the type that never gives up, he loses most of the fights he's in and does not receive asspull powerups in the middle of a battle. 
Killua Zoldyck is the other MC and he is well liked for good reason. He's calm, rational, badass and overall fun to watch. Luckily, they don't just leave his character at that. He has believable character flaws as a result of his life with a family of mad assassins. In a sense, he is the perfect balancer for Gon and they both play off each other and allow each other to grow.
Kurapika is also an MC, but he is not as plot relevant as the other two. He has a lot of similarities to Sasuke Uchiha backstory wise, but they couldn't be more different. He is calm, a bit overpowered, but can sometimes become irrational in his quest for revenge. He puts his friends first though.
Leorio is the last MC, but he bearly gets any screen-time. He is often used as comic relief but also serves as a rational guy who can keep a level head and ground the other three.
There are a variety of other supporting characters such as Melody, Biscky, Kite, Knuckle, Shoot, Palm etc, who are also well developed.
Now the villains are the best part of HxH. Nowhere else have I seen villains in shows receive such treatment. 
Hisoka is a psycho clown who's looking for a good fight. I love him because you never know what he's thinking, or whose side he's on. One moment he's the main antagonist, two arcs later he's playing dodgeball with Gon and Killua. He's unpredictable and oh so fun to watch.
The Phantom Troupe differ from any villain organization I have seen because they deeply care about one another. You can feel their pain when one of the members dies, or how much they care about their boss. They aren't out for world domination, they are just a bunch of thieves with a different ideology. 
All of the Chimera ants are incredibly well developed, so much so that even the henchmen had more of a character arc than most support in other anime. But the king, Meruem, is unlike any other villain I have seen before. You can see him changing episode by episode, not becoming eviler, but instead questioning if world domination, the task he was apparently born for is even worth it. This all starts when he meets a blind boardgame master who he cannot beat. She is the first person he encounters that makes him rethink his actions. At the end instead of getting a triumphant scene where Gon defeats him in a grand fight, we get a sweet, yet sad death scene that will hit you in the feels better than any romance anime could.
ARCS
Yorknew and Chimera Ant are considered the best. While most people agree on Yorknew, opinions on Chimera Ant are split. I loved it because I had never seen such a crazy role reversal happen before. In this arc, the hero becomes the villain and the villain becomes the hero. The most controversial part of the arc is the narration. It can get a little slow at times so whether you like it depends on your preferences.
POWER SYSTEM
10/10. Best Power System in shounen. The fights are creative, strategic and you never know the outcome.
I say that you should watch this show without overhyping yourself. Lower your expectations and create your own opinion. Often reading other peoples reviews can ruin a show. It happened to me with Black Clover. Everyone was hating on it so I did too, but when I eventually watched it I actually found it really enjoyable. Everyone is different. Give HxH a try and see what you think about it.",10
"
                I had always put this anime in my ""plan-to-watch"" list but then decided to give it a shot. Was not disappointed!
The character development of this anime is very well-done -- probably one of the most strongest suits of this series. I also love that the main characters are not OP from the get-go unlike some anime *cough cough*. Although Leorio did not get much screen time as the series progressed, he was still an enjoyable character, particularly due to him always being the one giving off the ""comedic"" vibes. Kurapika, on the other hand, was a total badass. 
Furthermore, we get to witness the kindling
                  friendship of Gon and Killua -- which was both heartwarming and kind of sad, at some parts. What started out as a rivalry turned into a bond.
The animation is top-notch. The art perfectly fitted the series, especially Hisoka's ""orgasm"" interactions -- which was both funny and creepy at the same time.
The same thing goes for the music/OST/sounds of this series. I personally loved opening 1 and ending 3 and 5 of the series. Topnotch!
Overall, I enjoyed the series. ""A lot"" would be an understatement. Sure, the story is far from perfect, but to me, it was VERY enjoyable. If you haven't watched it, then go watch it. You will not regret it!
Here's hoping to the continuation of this amazing series!

                After finishing Hunter x Hunter (hereafter HxH) one week ago, I felt compelled to create an MAL account solely to review this series. HxH is great, bordering on excellent, show, but its flaws are too sizeable for it to deserve its current rating or to measure up to what i consider the benchmarks of quality in this genre (madoka, code geass). Its fatal flaws are twofold: the weakness of its final arc and the disappointing underutilization of interesting characters.
As a whole, HxH tells a compelling story; the first three episodes suggest that the show is cast from the same mold as other shonen pieces, but
                  the following episodes oblierate that expectation and confirm that HxH has no shonen peers (looking at you, Bleach and Naruto). Moreover, the story is far more tightly crafted than a 148-episode series has any right to be: I can think of only two episodes that I consider filler, with the rest all directly pushing the plot forward in an entertaining way that makes for easy binge-watching.  
Given the high bar that HxH set for its own writing, you can imagine my disappointment upon discovering that the show's final 12 episodes, which focus on the Hunter Association's internal politics, constitute one of the weakest arcs in the series. This plotline is poorly foreshadowed. Although we know from the previous arc that the Vice Chairman is maneuvering for position, it is not clear what is at stake should he win. The other characters loathe the Vice Chairman, but we're never shown why. Moreover, it's not clear why we should care about this election, and an attempt to give it larger meaning -- by focusing on the importance of reforming the Hunter Exam and the Hunter Commandments -- is sloppily executed, as that concept is introduced mid-way through the elections and there had been no previous indication that those institutions were deficient. Additionally, there is something of an earth-shattering revelation about the Vice Chairman -- that he has sequestered a sizeable number of human mutants in land the Hunters Association now controls -- that is completely dropped. Although I enjoyed the arc's exploration of Zoldyck family dynamics, one of the Zodlyck family members serves as something of a 'deux ex machina' that, while interesting, could have at the very least been foreshadowed during one of the previous Zoldyck family encounters. I understand that the penultimate Chimera Ant arc is intended to serve as story’s climax, but that is no excuse for the final arc’s underwhelming performance. 
As a whole, HxH creates rich characterizations of its protagonists and antagonists alike, which sets the show apart from its peers. It is therefore a shame that the show failed to take full advantage of those interesting characters. I am less concerned about the disapperance of Kurapika, who experiences solid character development during the Yorknew City piece, and Leorio, whose role seems confined to comic relief, than I am about the limited part that Hisoka, Chrollo Luclifer and the Phantom Troupe, and the Zoldyck family play during the meaty Chimera Ant arc and the ultimate Election arc (elements of the Zoldyck family are important players in that arc, however). Rather than leverage existing characters, the show introduces a cast of newcomers, some of whom are compelling (Kite) and others of whom are not (Knov, Morel, Knuckle, and Shoot in Chimera Ant; the Zodiacs during the Election). Hisoka is hinted to have more complicated motivations and backstory than one initially assumes, and the Greed Island arc suggests that something big is in the offing for Chrollo--but nothing comes of those threadlines. Instead, Hisoka is completely absent in the Ant arc (which is surprising for his character, who relishes tests of strength) and relegated to mere hired help during the Chimera Ant episodes. Completely absent during the Election season, Chrollo's Phantom Troupes makes a one-episode apperance in the Ant arc that is so inconsequential that I deem it one of the few examples of filler.  
I do not wish for readers to gain the incorrect impression that HxH is a bad show. It is generally well done, and I would strongly encourage each and every one of you to watch it. Other reviews have done much credit to its strengths, and I simply want to focus on the weaknesses that that other respondents have neglected. From the reviews, I expected a masterpiece, especially during the finale of the Chimera Ant arc. The episodes were strong, but because my expectations had grown unrealistic, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. I merely wish to prevent further viewers from having their enjoyment of an otherwise-entertaining show diminished in that same fashion.",8

                Overshadowed with the Shounen behemoth trio, Hunter x Hunter was never the series to get the attention and popularity it deserves, that is,  until the recent decade, where the much needed 2011 recut was released.
Even to the outsider, Hunter x Hunter (2011) had quite the impression for a Shounen series, especially the long and mainstream ones that are known for receiving constant backlash from intoxicated fandoms and limit-crossing criticism. “Ah that show with over 900 episodes? I could never catch up with it now”, “That show whose protagonist's ultimate trump card is a one-on-one talk with the villain? That does not sit quite right
                  with me!”, “That show where the power scaling makes no sense? Well, me watching it might as well make little as much sense”. You hear them, you debate them (or not), these are the common complaints you'd hear from people who are being recommended any of the major players in the Shounen game, however, it goes entirely the other way when you specify the Anime at hand.
Hunter x Hunter seems like that show that has figured out the formula. Action-packed, dark-toned Shounen that spans a reasonable amoung of episodes, steaming with modern-day production values from what goes for its visual and vocal fidelity, adding to that the backing up of its source material that the fans love to swear by, that is a successful packaged deal that has been sought the moment the decisive business handshake was made.
Story (9/10):
When I think Shounen, I think the journey. The journey a young character has to go through in order to achieve a certain childhood dream, that is, the core definition in which by the majority of shows follow word by word, something that makes all of those shows almost look like a bootleg indie mobile game that's embarrassingly a reskin of a formula that works. The definitive template for your generic Shounen, if you will.
A formula that works is an attraction for mass production, you've got a template, and you have an idea, just reskin the rest and you have a popular Shounen of a respectable fan base. Of course, the pillar of the genre are the ones who embrace the formula and introduce new takes to it, sometimes even altering the original blueprint by wich other shows in the future follow, and we've seen a lot of that from the likes of Dragon Ball and the Big Three.
With pride and compassion, Hunter X Hunter's identity as a Shounen couldn't be any less obvious, like a packaging print on the forehead, the likes you'd see behind agent 47's neck (from the Hitman series), and unfortunately, just like the latter, gets by unnoticed. With a defining linear timeline, it clunches to the goal it sets by at the beginning of the series and work its way through several interconnected arcs until it hits the sought out deadline, and then expands on the vast, mysterious world it takes place in.
A weird and enticing flavor that the 2011 recut has going for it, that none of the highly glorified Shounen kings shares, is the snappy and swift progression, never feels so draw up when you look at it, episodes fly by so fast and still reveal on so much intel that would take your typical Shounen show several episodes to fill in the gaps. With an invisible amount of two filler episodes (Just two recap filler episodes to be more specific, episode13 and episode 26), it puts the majority of other shows to shame, not only with the canon material reign but also, just the rightly paced plot progression, you never spot a drawn-out, time buying nonsense that does not contribute to the development of the story in any way.
A Shounen specific plague the Coronime (a play on Covonavirus) that's popular among the genre and a personal annoyance of mine is the unwanted fan service inserts that jump you off randomly, sometimes on some of the most important moments, ending up ruining any kind of build-up that would make you care, Hunter X Hunter just doesn't have that, its very blueprint doesn't have that in it, I would sit here and try to come up with a scenario of it, and I would never be able to. It's just that good and interesting that it never swelled by the Ecchi plugs in favor of its story, basically, it has re-defined what fan service is.  A WELL CONSIDERED DIRECTION. But minimum to none has followed on its steps.
A weird, but interesting pattern I've grown to notice in the linearity of the plot, although quite repetitive (but still varies), is the heavy game structured arcs, or what makes the most out of an arc. Basically, seeing past the subjective structure of events, you find that most of the situations at hand are walled into a competitive game between two parties or several, all focused on the prize which is usually linked to Gon's endgame goal; finding his father.
The first arc “The hunter exam” is purely strategic, endurance battle royal, a wrenching race against time and stamina disguised behind the name of “selection exam” and then after, following the same premise, “Heaven's Arena”. This dedication to the game theory goes as far as being the foundation of one of the major arcs, “Greed Island”; a full-on simulation card game that builds itself atop of the real world; and then there is the massively emotional obsession of board and mind games between certain characters in “Chimera Ant” arc, a psychic look at how a game can play one's mind, doubting one's superiority and changing them for the better or worse.
Gon's quest to finding Ging is an event that's been teased up almost every single episode, being the main focus of Gon and the series, episode by episode and step by step, the goal is closer than ever by the end of each episode, making you feel the advancement of their journey as the fast pace shows really well in this perspective.
Right at the finish line, when the big reveal is up, there is a certain fill of satisfaction, but also a deep disappointment that accumulated after building up your expectations to a degree that the show was never wanting to deliver on. Don't have high hopes folks, and just get by what the show throws at you, as it's filling in its rightful way.
Art (8.5/10):
You ever sit down and wonder if your favorite show could get the FMB:A treatment, this analogy has been used so much that it pretty much became a common expression to hear all the time. The 2011 recut for Hunter x Hunter was just that, and for an amazing show, to begin with, it meant everything to the fans of the original.
Even in 2019/2020, the overall visual quality is still appreciated, breathing of talent and consistency, putting some seasonal shows to shame even.
For some people, saying that the studio behind this recut is none other than the fantastic folks at Madhouse, they have been regarded as one of the bearers of the holy crown in the industry for the quality shows they produce (align side Trigger, Kyoto Animation, Bones, etc...), and Hunter x Hunter was yet another nail hammered right in its place.
If I had to nominate a visual aspect to receive the attributed trophy in the stead of anything else visual, it would be the character designs, especially after you come from the 1998 original, the difference is staggering, you can make out which character's which, but the improvement that you even never asked for are there, and are much welcomed, they don't feel dated or dragging, finding every excuse for the visual perfectionist in Anime to keep watching.
The only nitpick I would probably not overlook is the “lazy” animation and lackluster of fluid transitive choreography. It seems that Madhouse has set up a high ceiling for what you'd expect from both a third party studio and itself, that the expectations are always at the upmost of their height that you can't help but get bugged at every slippery pixel out of place. Aside from a handful of really good, directly cinematography wonders, the rest of the action feels very unmotivated on a visual note, as I said, there are some fantastic displays of animation that really speak Madhouse's name and echoes it back and forth, but some other shots++ really look like a tightly budgeted J.C Staff production that must have slipped away from a wrong internship insert.
Sound (9.2/10):
“If it's working, don't fix it”. As a programmer myself, that is a motto I live by, and it is also the motto this show regards its opening theme song by. The vocal capability alone is superbly enchanting you into each episode, inviting you in, calming you down, preparing you for what's in store. The visuals seem to change during every arc, showing relatable imagery to the story arc it spans over leaving the vocal as familiar as it was in the very first episode, it's a formula that works, as long as the song is a total party banger, which it is in this case.
A spare of clean clothing every now and then is nice, and so is a change to a reoccurring pattern. The opening is excused for how good it is, but the ending theme songs don't quite scale up nicely, that is, until the story arc in-frame changes tones. We are treated with a collection of amazing ending theme songs, almost every arc or midway, reflecting on every shred of emotion that the episode closes on.
A big part of my experience with Hunter x Hunter (2011) was the excellent selection of voice actors and actresses. Never an overly loud, ear scratching amateur. Gon's and Killiua's voice actors do deliver on such a great spectacle, those squicky high-noted voices fit perfectly with their physical portrayal, they do play emotions and intensity nicely and carry on the script at hand, making for believable and relatable plays.
Characters (10/10):
Long-running shows have a tendency to feature lovable characters or in some cases, make you think it does. Being stuck with the same cast of characters along 3 number digits episodes makes you accept them and get used to seeing them that suddenly stopping watching bring feelings of emptiness.
Hunter x Hunter (2011) embraces all of that, only that it highlights its key characters so well that even after the very first episodes you're left astonished at how deeply attached you've grown with the majority of characters.
Gon Freecss is a very interesting specimen. The general trope that a basic Shounen takes for granted is to feature a goofy character that has sacrificed half of his or her brain cells in favor of some promised powerups and shares in the plot armor, but not with this wholesome, go-lucky boy. Gon is a self-described prodigy, one that thinks before acting, observes and dissects the situation with a mature tone that lifts him up even among his age-demographic peers.
The progressively linear flow of the story makes sure it does its protagonist justice, it is guaranteed for him to shine during every single arc, one way or another, from impressing the witnesses and even himself in his raw physical power, to getting thrown at the darkest, most sickeningly depressing phases that would easily overstressed the sanest person around. He is one and before all, a caring, extremely loving, loyal friend that always brings joy and happiness around wherever he goes, standing as a light of hope for many characters that primarily includes his close friends; Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio.
As a Shounen, and a definitive classic at that, you've gotta have a rival or a character of similar status that accompanies the protagonist on whatever quest he or she is on, and for the most of the series, Killua is all of that. From the very first arc, Killua is as important and as focused on as Gon is, and on some arc even more that it makes you question the protagonist label on Gon sometimes. Really, Hunter x Hunter, both the original and the recut do a fantastic job in separating the plot and characters; meaning that bearing the protagonist label isn't necessarily the focus of the show, but rather, just a vehicle for us to explore the much, more rich and extensive world.
Taking a step back, the duo Gon and Killua feel like each other's cameraman, when Gon is going through hard times, it is Killua that takes on the spotlight, narrates what he has in mind, works up solutions for his friend's problems and acts as the definitive bridge between us the viewers and the crossed over universe in the screen and it is as apparent with Gon and it is with Killua, a classic story of getting your buddy's back.
Something that I've always found very unique to One Piece is the reoccurring returns of past characters that never cease to be irrelevant, no matter the time frame or the arc's setting, Hunter x Hunter opened my eyes and had me consider other shows to have the same quality in that regard. Not only a few but a lot of faces are being referenced every now and then, starting from the very familiar Kurapika and Leorio to the numerous occasional sightings of the members of the phantom troupes.
I found it funny how the longest and probably the most popular arc of the series has a huge theme of individuality going on, just how every other character, important or not is, very individual and unique that it stands up no matter how overshadowed it is. Kurapika for instance, tells a story of his own, very independent than anything else going on, but still, partially relates to the overarching story, and Leorio... Leorio is one that you don't see very often. He was a meh kind of character from the moment he was introduced until he puffs away along with Kurapika, and as you think you'll probably never see him he gets back to the scene at the very last episodes and showing off why he IS a proud Hunter x Hunter character, from 0 to 100, he is one of my favorite characters in the show and has done so anonymous like a slap to my face.
A specific character to me was very intriguing, very provoking to the idea of considering watching the show in the first place, that would be Hisoka. I grew up with the 1998 show, however, my memory was still very fuzzy about it, aside from the names Gon, Killua, Kurapika (or Kurabika as I thought it was at the time) and Hisoka. Even now, he is the very confusing and complex persona I always thought he was, he is like no other in the show, vibing in a creepy pedophilic way that throws one-off, but his charismatic interaction with the rest of the cast makes up for it, the dramatic flavoring was strong with that one.
Really, the star of this show lives in its characters, staring so many iconic and lovable personas from what goes from protagonists to heroes, so unique and thought-provoking ideologies that put the majority of your typical Shounen villains to shame.
It is so satisfying to grow loving every decision the characters make that help shape their treats later, a true development to their values like watching a baby grow up into a healthy functioning decent human being. The Chimera Ant arc for example expanded on a very underrated aspect of any Shounen, that is breaking through the core of a character, past the Shounen norm and diving into their physiology and what makes them partake the label “Villain” or ”Hero”. Meruem, for example, takes his first step out of his mother's womb engulfed in a very bigotted, arrogance superiority complex, self-proclaiming to be the one and absolute king into a humble lost son of life's cause, after seeing the bigger picture of natural selection, it is not the sorted out pure genes that puts on your the highest position of the chain, but it is something else that makes an arrogant king humbler than a broke 3 digits years old farmer living in the boonies.
Enjoyment (9.5/10):
I love my Shounen, sometimes, maybe too much, but the majority of Shounen bandwagon I jump on end up very generic and confirming for the genre's trope-y run. However, once in a blue moon, I come across a series that changes my perspective on the genre and reminds me of why I'm this into Shounen series, the search for the core ingredient of what makes a Shounen really good, it's not the goofy main character, it's not the fights, nor is it the turnouts. It's the whole package.
Hunter x Hunter (2011) reaffirms a lot on its genre, featuring fights that keep you begging for more and character development that has you revise your character rankings all the time, it pushes the hype, and never seems to slow down, that objectively, not a single arc was any lower than pure greatness.
It has been a while since I could bear to sit through more than 3 episodes of the same show back to back, yes, I would binge a whole 30 episodes back when I first started watching Anime, but then again, I was a free boy during a long summer break, but now that I've got my hands full all the time, three episodes is quite the achievement for me to realize that I'm digging a show, but pushing even further (Which Hunter x Hunter (2011) had me do throughout the run) means that I'm really into what I'm watching, that was me during the Soul Society arc (Bleach), further, a year later, I get to live the same long-sought hype craving with Hunter x Hunter 2011, but this time, not during a single arc, but the entire show. Crazy.
Overall (9.24/10):
One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach might not resonate for all, seeing how long and kind of old they are, but Hunter x Hunter 2011 comes with a lot to offer that it leaves no excuses for not being watched, it is a pleasing magnet. Not so many shows can fast forward you from the first episode straight to the last without even realizing the time spent watching, so immersive and intense, it discards the tiniest drop of boredom, no yawns throughout, or at least, none that you can feel to keep a count of, the anxiety and risks the characters are taking are so well delivered that you yourself get dragged into the overarching drama, forcing you to sob along, and cheer when needed.",9

                This is deffinetly in my Top 5 favourite Anime of all time after Code Geass, JJBA.
As you can see Hunter Hunter 2011 is very highly rated on MAL to the point of contesting #2 and for good reason, as it is THAT amazing.
The main cast in is insanely loveable and just amazing. The villains are overall some of the best, and most of them also very likeable.
This adaptaion goes above and beyond it's source material and previous show from 1999, as it adapts every thing to it's utmost potential and adds to it also.
The aniamtion and art are very high-quality and not just by long-running
                  Shonen standards, where it is so consistent to the point that i seriously wonder how they pulled it off.
The world is the best I have ever had the pleasure of expienceing as it is just that vibrant and mysterious, as adventure stories should have.
As is the power system wich is basically the best in all of Shonen followed byy Stands(JJBA) in my oppinion. 
The Chimera Ant Arc is so good that I would have to call it a instant masterpiece and the most transcendent part/Arc of HxH by far and Anime in general.
The only reason in my eyes why HxH isnt #1 is because of its earlier Arcs being not quite as good as the Chimera ant Arc and York New Arc.  
My fav character in the show is Shaiapouf, because is no joke a crazy fanatic, obsessed with his ideal image of his King going to crazy lengths to make things go just the way he wants. And somehow I still manage to love him and want him to suceed over the ""good guys"" eventough he is such an asshole!! ;)",10

                My all time favorite anime that's what Hunter x Hunter is. I do have a bit of personal bias because hxh was the first anime I ever watched, and I have since rewatched this anime 12+ times now and every time it's as great an experience has the last. The world building was beautiful right from the beginning. The idea of adventuring a massive world filled with mysterious creature's is just so captivating. The animation is beautiful and makes the most from the character designs from the manga. The characters were all unique and several are very relatable even if they aren't exactly the good
                  guy. The protagonist is someone who hits that typical Shonen trope of making friends along the way and winning with friendship but the development of Gon Freece is astounding by the end of this anime. Gon's goal is a simple one but one that makes him a more relatable character and that's the goal of finding his father. We quickly meet the supporting cast who each have goals and personalities that can be understood by anyone. Hunter x Hunter is a must watch for anyone who calls themselves a weeb.",10
"
                So, when I first discovered Hunter x Hunter, I was aware of the original and the 2011 remake. To be honest, the 2011 is much more superior to the original, but it's sometimes nice to watch the original every now and again.
The TV 2011 version of Hunter x Hunter has many more episodes than the original, which can be seen as a pro or con for certain watchers.
Due to be having too much free time, I loved every episode and finished it within a few weeks.
Hunter x Hunter personally had what I was looking for in a show.
Plot, Action, Relationships, Drama, and much more.
Not only
                  did it focus on the action and fight scenes, but it also focused on the relationships and background of characters. It also followed a decent plot, and the show was easy to follow and understand ( for me personally ).
I would recommend this show to many people. It has progression, plot, action, gore, and relationships ( friendship and otherwise ) so it can fit around many different watchers likes and/or dislikes.",8

                I love HxH it is a good anime first of all I love the world building it may be slow but it's so good I love how it takes it's time to develop the world building and it happened right before the viewers eyes i personally think that HxH best arc is the Chimera Ant Arc is what hold down the series but in my personal opinion i think yorknew is better because it was somewhat more to the bases of nen and it was taken more seriously before all this power boosting that came out of no where i still say that HxH is
                  a good anime like i said it's slow paced but its still amazing especially the fight scenes and the movies are amazing like this is the best anime to start off on in my opinion",10
"
                first of all, lets get straight into the point....this show just blows my mind in a good way, EVERYTHING about hunter x hunter is just a masterpiece. from the character, story, world building, character development etc. its all 10/10
Togashi did a great job by pretending that this looks like your typical shonen anime...and its not, i feel bad for people who haven't watch/dropped HxH
HxH is 100% THE BEST shonen anime ever, and now 2020 and it still the best anime
i love everything about the main 4 character, HxH is rich in world building, character development, great story, great antagonist, everything is just awesome
Madhouse did a
                  fantastic adapting HxH, if you haven't watch it..please watch it
HxH will 100%  permanently my top 1 anime of all time",10

                Slade’s Quick Review
I see many people giving this anime a 10 and to be honest I wouldn’t disagree with them. This anime is my favorite of the Shonen genre, because it deviates so far from the basic, fight this new bad guy and get stronger to do so, stereotype. Hunter X Hunter gives a mixed feeling of wholesome, adventure, dread, and intense action. I won’t say all the characters in this show are great or even good, but when they are good, my god, they are some of my favorite characters in anime. Its also rare to see an anime this long with so few
                  fillers, every episode feels like you have to watch it. There are reasons I didn’t give this anime a perfect 10 and that is because, while this is the best Shonen its still a Shonen and that means using some tropes and following some patterns for things. I feel an anime with a 10 rating should be completely unique as well as good, and that’s why I so rarely give a 10 for a rating.",9
"
                Like many other highly popular anime, HxH has an insanely good start, but somewhere down the road there is an exchange of quality for accommodation of the spectator. While not being as popular as other big franchises or overhyped anime from this decade, HxH manages to kick off to one of the strongest starts I've ever seen in an anime or series and never loses steam, in fact steam is built up. The Hunter Exam Arc has it all, those were probably the best 21 episodes of shounen anime I'll watch - good protagonists who never cease to impress us, great side characters, clever and
                  witty fights that are completely unforgettable, and so much more. It is only normal that the Zoldyck arc calms down things a little bit, but the Heaven's Arena arc picks all the steam up again, allowing the viewer to breathe for a little while, wondering where the story will take them. 
However, this is the shortcoming of HxH. All the steam that was initially built up is just steam and never quite materializes to a well structured and logical story, with each arc after the Heaven's Arena being just a side entertainment for what we were promised from the beginning. This could be a good or even great thing, had it been done right. That is not the case though, as the Yorknew City arc leads up to a completely useless ending, that doesn't impact the story at all. This becomes a clear issue in the series, as the plot is mainly a character device to allow Gon and Killua to grow. This becomes even more evident on the Greed Island arc, which again feels like a good side story that could have been excluded from the anime - pointless villains, pointless videogame and a pointless card system which the viewer is somehow expected to know and learn like it is something important, when absolutely don't need to because in the end only a handful of cards really mattered. If only a handful of cards matter why create an entire collection of 100+ cards? Later on, exactly the same problem happens with Gungi, where you are expected to know how the game works without any detailed explanation. Unfortunately, you have to buy the manga or research online about some pointless anime boardgame to truly enjoy the symbolism that is meant to be brought by it. You'll watch the same two characters play this game where you have no clue of what's happening, except of one technique called kokoriko that carries the most symbolism, apparently. 
Transitioning into the worst arc, where Gon was finally meant to focus on finding his father, we get a bunch of flesh eating ants that end up being a mix of Cell and Buu from DBZ without any logical explanation. There is a lot of irrationality involved, including beings that are born wearing clothes and having a fully evolved conscience without any learning, nurturing or explanation. These Chimera Ants are just there and they can be some kawaii neko bullshit that you have probably seen or heard in 100 other anime (nyaaaaaa), some excentric flamboyant guy whose personality replaces Hisoka's for the entirety of the arc and many other secondary characters who just exist for fanservice purposes, be it sexual or not. Also, two of the most important characters go on a complete hiatus for 70 episodes. Gon's attitude makes 0 sense the entire arc, all the wit, guts and instinct that he had before is magically lost.
Another tragedy of the Chimera Ant arc is the fact the the main portion of the arc is set on 30 minutes of plot time. The Captain Tsubasa antics are completely offrails and 1 episode set in this main portion of the arc is translated to a minute or less of plot action. Many people complain about other shounen for doing this and actually praise HxH for not doing it, when HxH is actually one of the biggest offenders I've ever seen. +40 episodes that cover only 1 hour of action is something that has completely no reason or even need to exist. The narrator is annoying, every single move, be it the motion of someone raising a fist or the loss of a hairstring has to be explained in a OCD ritual that sometimes lasts the entire half of an episode. One of the biggest problems here is that Gon and Killua, who took months or even years to learn new things, only take 10 minutes to learn twice as much as they learned in the past years. Oh, did I mention the same applies to EVERY OTHER CHARACTER? Half of the plot is only there as a device to develop characters or even to describe absolutely worthless and unimpactful characters like Gyro, who gets an entire episode dedicated to him, or like the many characters who have to have an absolutely fleshed out story only to die or be completely neglected the next episode. Does HxH do it good, though? Yes. Is the anime still very enjoyable? No doubt. Is there the need to fill an otherwise great anime with all this vague content? Absolutely not. I would rather know how Kurapika and Leorio were doing, instead of having all these random characters (that will fade into the background) get all the attention via a circumstantial life story.
Another detail is that Meruem is not the amazing and super great villain that people say he is. He is a mainly immature dude (literally), who is as evil as they come, but cares for the ones who are on the same intelectual dimension as him (Komugi). The most redeemable part of this arc is the ending, which was actually really good compared to the weaker endings of the previous arcs and the secondary characters who regularly had screen time throught the entire arc.
The last arc is builds up a little bit of steam again, but there are many issues again. It becomes increasingly evident that a lot of the characters in this anime are part of a shock value agenda. For some reason, every member of Killua's family has to be a special snowflake that has either genderbending characteristics or homoerotic tendencies. This is an obsession throughout the entire story which is filled with characters like this for no reason other than to shock or confuse viewers: Kurapika, Bisky, Neferpitou, Alluka and Karuto are some of the more notable examples. There is absolutely no explanation given as to why many characters have to be like this and it becomes annoying to the point where it looks like the anime is trying to spread some edgy propaganda to its viewers. Otherwise it can just be assumed as some top quality fanservice to please every little portion of the fanbase.
The end of this last arc feels premature as HxH ends in a pretty good and memorable spot and leaves fans wondering how long will it take for another season. With its ups and downs, HxH ends up being an extremely enjoyable anime overall and one of the best shounens out there in terms of raw quality and potential to continue on and on.

                ENGLISH REVIEW:
Hands up one of the best written shounen anime out there.The story is divided into 7 different arcs.Every arc have different stories and approaches.One of the best arcs is Chimera Ant but i personally like Greed Island Arc.
Actually i am kinda suprised of how high the score of this anime at first.It even beats One Piece,Dragon Ball and Naruto which all four from Shounen Jump.I think it because the beautiful remake and adaptation from Madhouse.
When you see fighting animation in HXH,you'll know that character movements are really fluid.They managed to make it without any 3D animation.
But what about characters well many character you see
                  in this anime is really fascinating from their powers,motives,purposes,and traits.Togashi make some of the character terrifying like Hisoka,Illumi,Killua and even Gon.
The most unique experience you can get is NEN system,a power level so sophisticated and complex.It even have one episode dedicated to the explanation of NEN power.I can't explained it here.Better watch the anime.
The other thing is Battle Strategy.Yes a strategy that other shounen anime lack.This is not about stupid power of friendship or maybe some kind of DEUS EX MACHINA happening.
The best character when a battle started of course THE NARRATOR especially in chimera ant arc.Hofefully he explains everything in order or the audiences will start shaking their head.
Art is kinda good,sound is fine.I want to talk about story especially in one particular arc.
The story of this anime is one hella ride.It covers so many subject,personally i like chimera ant arc where humanity,nature,war,ethics,species,and environment element was combined into one fine story.When you see some of the character lose humanity and the other gain sense of humanity you'll know this anime is deep.When the bomb start dropping you'll know that resembles a nuke.The rest of the arc is enjoyable too like Yorknew City when this resembles crime thriller or Greed Island that resembles many isekai gaming anime that come out now.
At last i will say this anime is masterpiece.A magnum opus to a beginner and even an old anime fan.I ENSURE YOU IT'S NOT BORING AND HAVE HIGH REPLAYBILITY.I know this review don't cover all of the anime.But you must watch it to MAXIMUM ENJOYMENT.
REVIEW INDONESIA:
Tonton aja guys,banyak hal-hal menarik di anime ini HUNTER X HUNTER menyajikan cerita yang lebih kompleks dan menarik dibanding anime lain.Ketika lu sampai ke arc yang Chimera Ant itu semuanya akan berubah.Gw jamin itu arc paling menegangkan walaupun lu harus melihat arc awal.Tapi arc pertama sebenarnya sudah bisa menarik penggemar anime manapun kedalam dan mengubahnya menjadi fans anime ini.Mungkin episodenya panjang,tapi tidak ada satu episode pun yang sia-sia.Jadi lebih baik ambil jajan kalian dan duduk manis.",10

                Hunter x hunter is an incredible anime that completely deserves the recognition that it gets. It has great characters and an amazing story that is completely worth watching until the end. The story features a perfect blend of action, friendship and adventure that will keep you watching right to the ending. Gon and Killua's chemistry between each other is perfect which created many great scenes between the two of them. Just the characters already made me enjoy the anime as they all interact so well with each other and all have so many memorable moments that are enjoyable to watch every time you see them.
                  Definitely worth a watch and anyone who hasn’t seen it is missing out and should go and watch it as soon as possible.",10

                Man. What a masterpiece. When I started this show I did not expect this to become my favorite anime and boy did I get surprised. Hunter x Hunter breaks every single shounen rules and the characters win battles through pure hard work and training, not random power ups and the ""power of friendship"" like other shounen. The characters were amazing too, every character even the side characters were thought out with so much detail and made you care for every single one of them. No arc bored me, every single one entertained me more than the last. The villains, Phantom troupe was hands down the
                  best villain group I've ever met, making me even confused about who I should root for. This anime also had a low-key change of mood that I didn't even notice until that one scene with Gon, coming in, I expected a kids show but I was wrong, it addresses certain issues and goes really dark and deep. In conclusion, stop reading reviews and just go watch it because I assure you won't be disappointed",10

                Not Even gonna waste time writing much. This is a frickin entertaining Watch, an incredible piece. 
Completed the Original in 2018 and loved it so much, heck Hunter X hunter was the second anime I ever watched in my life, was a lil kid when I first saw it. 
Story: 10/10
Art: 10/10. Improvement in animation, loved that. 
Sound: 10/10. I loved that they stuck with the same OP.
Character: 10/10 Gon is my absolute Fave. I liked all the characters in this except Butterfly Chimera Royal Guard Guy, dude was so fucking annoying.
Enjoyment: 10. ENJOYED THE SHIT OUTTA THIS!Overall: MASTERPIECE!
Everything about this anime was good. The Chimera Ant Arc had great potential to be one of the best storyline I'd seen but dang! That fucking narration and the way it dragged, so tiring, nevertheless I liked it but NGL as hyped as I was for it, wasn't my favourite, it definitely was the darkest arc though and I enjoyed the shit out of it.This anime deserves Everything, so good.  
Oh wait, yeah I did find Gon's date with Palm a bit creepy, I mean Gon was fucking 12...Sheesh; well not gonna stress thinking much about that😅😅😅

                Hunter X Hunter is a battle Shonen at heart that pays homage to the classic tropes seen in other battle Shonen, while also breaking the mold and taking things in different directions. Every major battle in the show is won by tactics and strategy instead of brute force or random powerups. 
Be warned that the show is not as happy go lucky as the beginning arcs would suggest, so there are tonal shifts all over the various arcs of the show. However, this is pulled off masterfully and it makes every single arc feel truly different than the last. 
All in all, HxH is a
                  must watch if you enjoy battle shonen at all, just to be able to form your own opinion on it. 
10/10, Masterpiece x Masterpiece",10

                Hunter X Hunter is about a 12 Year Old called Gon who wants to become his father, who had left him to become a Hunter.
It is based on the manga made by Yoshihiro Togashi and is animated by Madhouse.
Hunter X Hunter is a great anime. It has very good dialogue and the dialogue rarely gets boring. The fight scenes are very excellent too. The vast world that they live in is great and I love it. The animation is awesome. 
Hunter X Hunter has a lot of good characters. The villains in Hunter X Hunter are more complex than in other anime. They have good
                  motives and their motives can change. Gon's and the main characters acquaintances help move the plot forward well. 
I watched the Sub and the voice acting was good.",10
"
                HXH 2011 IS NOT A MASTERPIECE. DON'T GET FOOLED MY FRIENDS. 
I finished watching both 1999 & 2011 version. 
   Apparently most of you here only watched 2011 version. No wonder if most of you think 2011 is masterpiece. 
  Since I watched both version I can confidently say that Nippon animation(1999&OVAs) handled Hunter exam arc and some scenes from other arcs until Greed Island arc better than Madhouse (2011). 
     I haven't read manga but checked out randomly. As far as I seen 2011 version is more faithful to manga than 1999 version. I mean 1999 have
                  bit more non canon scenes compared to 2011 but imo 1999 did Hunter exam arc BETTER than 2011 even though 2011 have better animation and interesting OSTs. 
   So I don't consider HXH 2011 as masterpiece like lot of ppl do. On the contrary I may consider HXH 1999 as masterpiece but not really perfect because 2011 did some scenes better than 1999. 
   Anyway last two arcs(Chimera Ant &13th Hunter Chairman Election arc) by 2011(Madhouse) are exceptions since they did great job in deliverance and also were not adaptation by 1999 version. 
    Let me explain.... Even though HXH 1999 has some fillers, they managed to expand the lore especially in Hunter exam arc with more realism, meaningfulness, emotional and impactful than 2011. While watching 1999 I felt the tension and danger that characters were facing in hunter exam arc while the hunter exam arc by 2011 version is felt like they going for fun ride or picnic.
    Also the 2011 version haven't adapted the backstory of Gon with Kite completely, skipped and censored some content from manga, which is a big L for Madhouse. While 1999 handled Kite backstory with Gon very well and If I haven't watched 1999 I wouldn't understand why Gon want to save Kite so badly in Chimera ant arc. 
Voice Acting:
 2011 did better voice acting compared to 1999. I give you that. 
Songs comparison:
Opening Songs: 1999>>2011
2011's opening song is lame compared to 1999.
Ending songs: 2011>1999
1999's ending song is good and nostalgic but 2011 got better ending songs. 
My arc rating and comparison of both HXH anime versions:

                I decided to write a review specifically for those who have already watched some or most of the show and are unsure if they want to continue, or if they havent started it because they are assuming they won't like the show 
 I have seen Hunter X Hunter in passing on streaming sites for years. At first sight, it did not appeal to me whatsoever. My assumptions based on the cover were that it was a not so original Shonen that was a rip off of Pokémon, geared towards children. Anyone who has seen even one episode knows this is definitely not the case.
                  The cover is usually of Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio, portraying them as the 4 main characters which I would have to disagree with. If only there was a cover that gives the viewer more of a perspective on how dark and cutthroat the hunter world is. Although the beginning starts a bit slow, after about 5 episodes in I was hooked. What I decided to watch as background noise while I worked on something demanded my complete attention, and I pretty much watched the whole Hunter Exam arc in one night. 
Story: Seriously such great story telling and characters. There are 6 arcs that make the series. Hunter Exam, Heavens Arena, Phantom Troupe, Greed Island, Chimera Ant, and the Chairman Election. The first three flowed pretty smoothly into each other. I'm not going to go into the details of the story, but explain my personal experience from watching. I think the idea of a big change to the story coming unexpectedly can be a turn off for people, as this doesn't normally happen. When Nen was first introduced into the show in the Heavens Arena, it threw me off at first and my immediate reaction was to reject it. I'm sure this isn't the case for many, but perhaps I'm just not used to longer series with arcs as I normally watch short animes. There are many big, unexpected changes that happen throughout the series. 
My only complaint when it comes to story is I think certain changes come a bit too unexpectedly. For example, the beginning of the Chimera Ant Arc. I can see why some stopped watching at this point and absolutely hated it. I also felt this way when I first got to this part of the series. I was so disappointed because until then I was completely addicted and never once got bored or uninterested. As I stated in the paragraph above, I think the flow and the introduction to new characters are very hard to take in at first. I started reading reviews and comments on MAL about the series and became very discouraged about continuing. I pretty much convinced myself that I wouldn't like the direction if was going and was completely influenced by others who said they had stopped watching. After a week or so of taking a break from the show, I found myself thinking about it and it's characters. I decided to give it another shot because I had so much love for it so far. 
Well, I wasn't disappointed! Once I started watching it again, I went back to being completely hooked. My advice to those reading reviews/posts like I did recently, do not be influenced by other's opinions on Chimera Ant Arc! Especially if they never bothered to complete the show. I'm not going to promise you'll love it, but I guarantee that it gets better. The beginning is a lot to digest, but once the plot thickens you might be like me and get completely hooked again. I absolutely despised the Ant arc at first, and didn't understand all the positivity about it at all. After finishing the show, my perspective is completely different. One of the best stories of all time, I recommend the show to anyone who likes anime. It is far from perfect, but the world itself is just amazing. 
Also, the theme song grows on you.",9
"
                This is the greatest show I have ever watched, and believe me, I have watched hundreds if not thousands of anime. Every time I see Gon and Killua come on screen it warms my heart. This show has truly changed my life it brought me so much happiness in my life ever since I first saw it. As I stated before I've seen hundreds of shows and none of them compare to how good Hunter x Hunter is. I think the only way the show could be better is if the author actually wrote it instead of playing Dragon Quest all day. Please if you
                  have not seen this show you need to watch it immediately!!!!!!",10

                - WRITTEN WHILST STILL WATCHING, AT EPISODE 65 -
The first word that comes to mind when I think about Hunter x Hunter is undoubtedly: VARIETY. With everything from insane, heart-raising action to comedy so ridiculous that I laugh alone in my room on numerous occasions; Hunter x Hunter is an anime that quickly shot to my number 1 favourite and only secures it's place more determinedly with every episode.
At this point, although still ongoing, I'm roughly halfway through HxH and I've loved every single minute of it. That's because in this show, every minute matters. You can't look away without missing something crucial, hilarious or
                  just generally entertaining. I was a late comer to the HxH bandwagon and after around 10 episodes, I was sorely angered with myself for leaving it this late. All I can say now is thank heavens I finally gave this anime a shot. NEWCOMERS. DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE LENGTH. WHEN YOU START WATCHING; IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER ANYMORE. Where I first found myself concerned as to whether I'd have the time or motivation to catch up with this anime, I now find myself worried about catching up and having to wait a week for each episode! And man, do those episodes fly by. The best anime are the ones that make it impossible to say 'okay, that's enough for now'. 
The array of interesting and unique characters is what really makes this series. HxH is not afraid to go with the cliche, make fun of the cliche, experiment with the dark and creepy, the light and fluffy, and everything in between. With 2 adorable yet terrifyingly powerful protagonists and their ever-changing company, you're guaranteed to come across multiple characters that you love, hate or just plain can't get your head around. But even without the constantly growing cast, Gon and Killua really do make this a special anime. Watching the two grow (albeit quite quickly with the pace of the anime) and experiencing all the WONDERS OF FRIENDSHIP AND SELF-DISCOVERY is easily the main reason for my love of this anime. Not forgetting, of course, creepy-ass perv Hisoka on the side is just the cherry on the cake.
Overall this anime is just plain fun. It's addictive, interesting, varied and entertaining in every sense of the word. It really is an anime that has something for everyone. WATCH IT.",9
"
                This will forever have a special place in my heart. The character's backstories and the creativity of their development is literally one of the most magical things I've ever witnessed. What an outstanding plot :') 
The song ""departure"", which you may know as the opening song for all episodes, is so extremely catchy. My heart melts for just the smile of some of the characters. It's no wonder how much this show is loved.
Kurapika and Alluka are the best characters in my opinion, although practically every single character made me feel empathy for them.
This show didn't focus as much on the sound and art, but
                  the animation and plot made every bit worth watching.",10
"
                I've always loved long-running action-adventure battle shonens. Be it Dragon Ball, the love of my childhood, or be it One Piece, my juice to go by every week. And so I was bound to love Hunter X Hunter, a show that uses what I love about these types of shows beautifully. It is, at its core, a fun adventure with friends in extraordinary places.
The best part of HxH lies in the humane relationships between the characters. Friendship as a concept for a story is overused to the point of being a complete meme, and yet it's overused because how beautiful it is when it's done
                  right. The show starts with Gon finding new friends and really kicks in when he meets with Kilua, while the show ends with the divergence of their paths. And everything we see in the middle is centred around their bond. But it's not limited to Gon and Killua. Kurapika prioritizing the safety of his friends over basically one of his life goals, the camaraderie between a group of bandits, a serial killer obsessed with some game prioritizing the life of his companion over his, or the romantic relationship between a fragile girl and a supposedly inhumane creature- bonds like these are the meat of this show.
If the bonds between the characters is the meat of the show, then the characters themselves can be called the bones. The individual stories of different characters as a whole form the overarching narrative of the show. The goals, desires, priorities and the growth of the characters drive the story forward. Killua, a child from an Assassin family who had no given choice in life but to keep killing according to orders, decided to run away from home to actually do something fun while finding his life chained and worthless. After becoming friends with Gon, he felt indebted to him and valued him more than anyone, while also fearing that his instincts would compel him to leave Gon to die one day. This show is as much or more about Killua discovering his self worth than Gon's initial goals. It's also about Kurapika's quest to avenge his brethren paralleled by the friends he come to value. It's about the Leorio's selfish motive of earning money for the selfless reason of being a doctor driven by the loss of his friend due to illness, about a bunch of bandits forsaken by society who found their own place and their own way of living in the world that rejected them, and it's also about a monster born to rule humans having an identity crisis and questioning his views, eventually discovering humanity in himself.
A common reason people don't seem to like HxH is its lack of an overarching story, and while it definitely does lack it, that doesn't make the plot bad. Rather Hunter X Hunter, by nature, focuses on the individual arcs and the stories of the characters from those specific arcs. It reflects the nature of our world, where there is no grand story that is happening on the scale of the entire world, but rather places waiting to be discovered waiting with their own people and stories, with the main cast, like us, being only a small part of it. Even friends don't stick around on other's journeys meaninglessly and instead pursue their own. And they meet back because they friends, they come rushing when their friends are in trouble. This as well reflects the type of friendship we experience, each on their own paths, we meet just to relax with the people we trust and are comfortable with. And due to this, the main cast of each arc usually changes, introducing fresh new characters along with new places and story with their own themes while fleshing them out on a personal level. This is why it can go from an exam arc to a martial arts tournament, to a chaotic thrilling mafia story, to an isekai game, to a war of survival, to a political battle, backed up by good world building and probably the most well written power system.
While Hunter X Hunter at times went quite dark, it is not a nihilistic show, it is more likely that things will still turn out good, to the point of dragging the show down. But still I love it for what it is. The animation is good enough, although some people prefer the color palate of the 1999 version, but I find the 2011 style more fitting of the philosophy of the show. It has good osts and despite basically only one opening, some of the endings are my favourite among all anime. Especially ""Reason"" and ""Hyori Ittai"" portray their individual arc very well. Of course there are still a lot more things I love about the show but I guess this is the limit of my expression for now.",10

                There is something about this anime that makes me want to come back to it a lot. First of all, I was recommended this anime from my sister's friend after she found out that I watch a lot of anime, but enough of that. When I first saw Hunter x Hunter, I thought it was very long and not worth watching because I thought it looked very childish, but boy was I wrong. The story depicts a young boy named Gon Freecss who wants to become a Hunter like his dad who he has never seen before, Gon's Quest is to find his dad while
                  also becoming a Hunter along the way, he also meets a lot of other people, like his friends Killua Zoldyck, Kurapika, and Leorio Paradinight. This Anime is great in the fact that It tells the story very smoothly and slowly but surely, the caterpillar becomes the butterfly. The Art style is phenomenal reminiscing another anime is known as ""Yu Yu Hakusho"", it was made by the same person who made that anime. Sound and Music are also amazing, sure the openings are the same in some of the arcs, but it still makes the Anime great. I enjoyed this anime a lot, so much so that I watched it on my way to school, in school, going home, etc. This anime, Overall, is one of my top 3 favorite animes in the whole wide world, 10/10 Definitely would rewatch the series.",10
"
                Hunter x Hunter is the arguably best shonen ever written, and the 2011 anime adaptation does a great job of adapting it. While there's a little bit of padding in some episodes and the background soundtrack can become a little too familiar (barring Hisoka's hilarious little guitar theme), everything else is excellent. The writing is unforgettable, the characters are one of a kind, and the fights are clever without being particularly contrived or drawn out. I would say that there is no other show like it, except pretty much every other well-respected shonen author ever has paid homage or drawn inspiration from it. 
I'd recommend
                  this show in a heartbeat -- go watch it now, if you haven't. It's one of the best anime ever made.",10
"
                *Spoilers*
Hunter X Hunter is a good story. It has all the characteristics that make for an enjoyable, suspenseful journey. There are many reviews that will expand upon this anime's strengths. I wanted to write a review on what ruined the entire series for me.
The Poor Man's Rose.
The author creates a long arc around the chimera ants, the most powerful foe the hunter association has apparently faced. The plan they lay out is to sneak into the castle as a surprise attack and spend months making preparations including entering the castle before hand to create portals for people to enter through. And there's the plot hole.
                  Episode 127. ""With the right technology, the bomb could be mass produced in short order"". They spend months trying to have people prepare to take the ant king down, when they could have just put a bomb in the castle and killed them all in short order. When the hunter association president attacks from above, they could have just dropped bombs on the whole area. Even with the introduction of the dark continent in the manga, the same issue arises. They could use bombs to get past any problem areas as they dig deeper in. The bombs existence creates problems that cannot be rectified.
The anime ends shortly after these events, and the manga has been paused at 390 for years. It's unbelievably plain to see that the manga continuation was literally thumb tacked on to expand the story another arc. Hunter X Hunter was good, until the author, Yoshihiro Togashi, attempted to expand the universe beyond his 1999 version and wrote himself into a corner, solving that problem with an easily produced bomb. Suffering from chronic medical issues, it was likely an attempt to capture further financial gains, however as the creator of Yu Yu Hakusho and an estimated net worth of $25 Million, that's just speculation. 
In conclusion, if you ignore this plot hole, the story is worth the watch. However, if your like me, this detail will ruin the entire journey.",7
"
                HxH is probably one of the best manga in its demographics, it knows how to carry the plot and it is all connected from the beginning, although I would have liked that the world building had been bigger I am quite satisfied with what I saw.
PD: The nen is the best power system I've ever seen.
Characters: Gon is a complete protagonist born on an island and in nature, with a black and white morality which leads him to be somewhat hypocritical, however this is correct with his character. Everything he does that everything he does he does out of curiosity and desire to know and
                  of course the desire to find his father
Killua is the most worked of the main 4 having through the arcs a change in his way of thinking and treating people
Leorio was not noticed as much in the story, although that is fine with his character since he is dedicated to studying to become a doctor, besides everything that follows after the end I am sure that it will be for Leorio to stand out, if even the same Gin says Leorio has great potential.
I think Kurapika was the one who worked the most on his mentality being an avenger (the original sasuke) his whole story is well worked, and his powers at first seem quite OP but it is a high cost that he has to pay too.
*Spoiler alert*
Currently I like how Kurapika is being used in the arc of succession practically risking more and more of his life. I am capable of expecting both him and the Genei to all end up dead. i cant wait for another chapter.",9
"
                Hunter x Hunter is a really good anime for people who enjoyed Naruto and Pokemon. In almost every respect it's great in its production and layout for its target audience. However, I wouldn't recommend this to everyone I come across. As someone who grew up watching animes with much darker tones and themes of death playing a very prominent role, Hunter x Hunter comes off a little too light-hearted, and unfortunately for me, the episodes move a bit too slow. Give the anime a chance, because it's very possible you could fall in love with it, but don't be massively surprised if it's not for
                  you.
I'm editing the review after having finished it. I feel the exact same.",7
"
                The story of HunterHunter is a worthwhile journey. Our main protagonists have whole arcs catered to building their story and background. The amount of detail put in is awesome. Additionally, the villains in the story, from the get-go all the way to the Phantom Troupe are my favorite villains of any anime. The swagger and raw strength we see when they're introduced is jaw-dropping. The dynamics built around all of the characters is fun to watch develop and unfold. My only gripe with the show is the final arc as of writing, the introduction of bugs as the main villains is quite off-putting compared to
                  what the show has been. However, the rest of the arcs all how their own individuality that keeps the story fresh and enjoyable. Overall this is a must-watch and is great for any knew anime fan.",9
"
                Others have praised Hunter X Hunter elsewhere. I am only writing what bothered me most about Hunter XHunter. 
This is a typical shonen and like others, suffers from an incredibly boring protagonist. Gon is the typical eager, refuses to give up, thick headed and over all perfect lead. His very presence irritates me and it takes away too much of the enjoyment from the story itself. On the positive side, the pacing is good and the world is interesting. 
Kurapika and Leorio, whose VA also voices Zenzo in Gintama and who by far is the weakest of everyone (its a mystery how he passes the
                  exam), are more interesting and its a pity they don't get much screen time, especially later in the long Chimera Ant arc.",6
"
                my favorite anime by far. 
I would consider myself pretty easy going when it comes to anime and how i would rate them but i could rave on and on as to why hunter x hunter was such a good anime. 
I'm a very impatient person and can only watch so much anime in one day but i could easily sit in a chair for 4 hours while watching hxh. 
Although the chimera ant arc had me wanting to quit for a month, i kept watching and realized how much more developed the season was than i thought. 
Killua is one of my favorite characters
                  considering where he came from and how strong he is and how well structured he is. 
I can definitely recommend this anime and would easily watch it over and over again because i feel like every time i watch it, it is a new experience.",10
"
                For those thinking ""this is just a little too long"", I plead with you to give it a chance. I can confidently say this anime is by far my favourite, not just because of the fact that it's a pretty ""sterotypical shonen"" but in the fact of how the story progressess. 
The story follows our main protaginist Gon and his adventures and struggles in becoming a ""hunter"" and much more. I give major appriciation to the authors of the manga creating the story and to those who worked on the anime for portraying it the way they have. Once settled into learning about the wonderous
                  world of Gon and his day to day mentality, we begin to grow more and more attached to the characters of the Anime due to us (viewers) being interquied about what's to come next. 
Many of us (viewers) are alwaus left content at the end of each arc and cannot wait to see the progression that's to come. Without spoiling anything about the Anime, I will say that if someone had asked me even half way through watching this series how it would ""end"" I would not have been able to guess. I just want to stated to expect the unexpected and to continue to push through the series as a fan. 
Now in stating all of this there are never NO critiques of a series. As amazing as the story is the one thing that let me down a little was the absoluetly complex power systems that one will have to somewhat learn or understand to be able to keep up with watch the show is possibily hinting or trying to portray. This being said, there are also some very small unpolished detials in the Anime that probably should have made it from the Manga. ie; Importance of characers, description of characters, inclusion of characters. 
Overall I want to end this with a good note and state that, if you are a looking for a surreal series to get into that has a lot of fighting and adventures then look no further. I sincerly suggest the series a watch.",10
"
                Just like to say, I haven't seen too much anime (about 2.5K episodes), so please be gentle. 
Hunter X Hunter at first seems underwhelming. At first glance, you look at it and say, ""looks like naruto, or a typical shonen"". Or of course, you may not say that.
I was hesitant at watching Hunter X Hunter at first, my friend told me to watch it and he'll watch Boku no Hero Academia for me (don't think he did, but I don't care). After watching a few more animes, I decided to pick up Hunter X Hunter and boy am I glad I did. 
At first, I
                  didn't know what to think of it, I didn't what was going to happen or where it was going. I wouldn't say I was instantly captivated like I was with The Promised Neverland, but I felt like there was something special about it. I decided to continue watching. I noticed that the pace of Hunter X Hunter wasn't very fast, it really did take its time, but I found the beauty in that. It gave me an excuse to spend more time with it. 
After the Hunter Exams Arc, I was gaining even more interest. I found that my favorite scenes weren't actually the fight scenes, but the training, and strong character development scenes. I do enjoy fight scenes and Hunter X Hunter pulls every single fight really well. It makes each fight feel it's own and unique which makes the audience feel engaged when a new fight starts.
After finishing the anime, I originally gave it a 7 or an 8. Although, the more I thought about the anime, the more I loved it. I would hear the music out of context and I then realized how much its music matches my taste in music. I noticed how unique of an anime it really is and how diverse the anime is. It then crept up to a 9 and eventually became my favorite anime. a 10/10.
The story seems pretty boring a first, a son tries to find out why his dad became a hunter. Seems pretty bland (for me at least). But soon I realized that's not what the story is, the story is the journey along the way, the characters we meet, the problems and conflicts we overcome, that's the story. Hunter X Hunter nails it on the head when it comes to this. The completely contrasting arcs, but always find it's way to link to the next, the way it sticks to being a shonen, the way it introduces new and different characters, it is all a work of art. I really found myself devoted to the storyline, of not just the protagonists, but also the villains. 
Yoshihiro Togashi didn't slack when it came to letting the audience know every nook and cranny of each character's story. Even the little details found its way into the audience's ears, making that much more enticing to learn.
What can I say, the art for Hunter X Hunter for me is perfect. The shots and colors used drew so much emphasis on the little and big things. The way each character stuck to color so perfectly filled me with excitement and awe of how beautiful it was. I don't think art matters too much in an anime, but it really can help emphasize other aspects of an anime. I don't have too much to say about Hunter X Hunter's art, just that I found it worked excellently with the style of the anime's music, characters, and music. There were also many jaw-dropping sights. 
Ah, music, something I truly am passionate about. I love classical music and jazz and I found both of those in Hunter X Hunter. Whether it be Leorio's theme, or In the Castle, it soothed my south and match my taste really well. I didn't expect this from an anime and I could say I was caught off guard. Anime really does have hype music, beautiful pieces, and goddamn absolute fire openings. Hunter X Hunter has all of these. The uniqueness of the decision made by Toshihiko Sahashi really stuck out to me, but again, the more I thought about, the more I saw that it helped Hunter X Hunter in so many ways. Music helps emphasize a certain emotion the audience is supposed to feel, and Toshihiko Sahashi didn't rest until he got you to feel what you wanted to feel. The instruments used, the genre, the tonality, it did more than its part to help Hunter X Hunter become what it is today.
What can I say, the characters in Hunter X Hunter are hilarious, enticing, and down-right epic. You have Gon and Killua, the duo that we as the audience care so much about, Leorio, the one that brings comfort to Gon and Killua (and some humor). Kurapika, the tragic backstory found in every anime. But let's also not forget their enemies, and when I say enemies, I mean, people with different views. How can we hate any character in Hunter X Hunter? Hisoka, a pervy pedophile, who else brings us awkward moments, but that what makes his character so different. Where else do we see awkward moments in Hunter X Hunter when Hisoka isn't around (I'm sure there are, but that is not the point). 
Meruem, the big bad guy of it all. At first, we want him to lose, we want Gon, Killua, Knuckle, and the gang to win, but the more we spend time with Meruem, the more we see how he is like. Furthermore, when the Chimera Ant Arc was closing, I felt something I hadn't felt since Death Note. I wanted no side to win. I loved all the characters (except Pouf), but I knew that there had to be a victorious side. Overall, each character has their own traits to bring to the table that, again, really makes Hunter X Hunter as unique as it is. 
In the end, I enjoyed Hunter X Hunter thoroughly, and the enjoyment didn't stop when I finished it, I got so much enjoyment thinking about it, enjoyment reliving the memories through youtube clips and talking about. 
Overall, I CANNOT think of something where Hunter X Hunter failed (excluding the hiatuses :c). People may disagree with my decision on Hunter X Hunter, but this is one of my tastes, this feels like it matches what I like so well that I wish I could remove the memories of me with Hunter X Hunter, just so I can relive it again. 
10/10 - Hunter X Hunter is a ""1 in a million"" anime to watch. 
- Rain",10
"
                The first thing I wanted to clarify, is that this was one of the first animes I watched so keep that in mind while reading this. (I'm also sorry if there's any mistake in the review, english isn't my native language.)
Hunter x Hunter is my favorite anime so in this review my main focus will be to convice you to watch the anime. Don't worry it's free from spoilers.
First of all let's talk about the characters, it's my favourite thing about Hunter x Hunter, they are really good written, you can notice the evolution of the characters troughout the experience. The side characters are also
                  pretty decent, there are some really good side characters. And the villans, one of them might be one of the best villans i've ever watch (from my short experience with anime).
The pacing of the anime might be one of the worst things, it's really slow at the first chapters and the last arc is too slow. It doesn't mean they're bad, in fact the last arc is the best arc in the anime, but if you don't like slowed pace animes you won't like Hunter x Hunter.
The OST is so good, every scene of the anime go with a good song to make it a good experience, the only flaw I can notice from it is that they re-use a lot of songs.
The anime for me is a 10/10 but I've rated it based on my enjoyment, if you want an objective score it'll be a 9/10.",10
"
                HunterxHunter is a massive breakaway from traditional shonun anime. I haven't seen many of those, but somehow, the cliches are still properly etched in my mind, and HxH breaks away from every one of those. 
At the start of the series, its basically a Shonun, except that this isn't a hardcore fight for your life, its just about a boy. This is where I began to get bored. Im a big fan of the cliches of normal shonun, the massive power-levels and 10 episode fights. I love hype. But HxH just didnt give me any of that at the start. But I did start to
                  notice some odd things that piqued my interest instead.
First thing I noticed was the amount of character development for side-characters. People we just met were talking about their backstory, so I assumed we would see them often as main, or main side characters. Nope. All that incredible detail and character-work was just lost when basically all of them never made it through a second episode. This was interesting... Why waste so much potential on side characters? Now, in anime this is just unheard of, but as someone who reads a lot of fantasy novels, this is exactly what you see there. This anime turned out to not just be an anime, but novel. A written piece of work, something that always touches more layers of humanity than animed or film work ever could. 
The main characters being introduced were OK I guess. I had no issues with them (Except for how I thought Kurapika was a girl for like, 3 arcs) except for how they were developed just as much as the side-characters. 
Something we are very used to seeing is a very steep learning curve for the character, one that takes maybe 10-20 minutes to fully flesh out the character before adding on bits and pieces later one. For HunterxHunter it is the opposite. The learning curves for the characters are astronomically low. To the point where its almost a linear line. You are always learning more about the characters, at the start where they seem very basic, to the end of the Chimera Ant arc, which is remarkably higher. By doing this, HxH leaves so much room to grow, without making the greatest characters the world has ever seen. It sets the story up to make the mcs the best ever, but does not do so hastily. This is an important distinction because this is what makes HxH so easily accessible to non-anime viewers. Its extremely easy to ease into the characters.
And before I go into plot structure, I wanna mention another awesome thing.Often Anime make it so the protagonists know what the watcher knows. Nothing more, nothing less. But in HxH, people only know what they would realistically know. There are SO many plot points that are instigated due to incorrect or out of date information, and it just adds another whole layer of realism to the mix. Its so noticeable later, and at some points you wanna pull your hair out but its so logical and realistic that I cant help but understand that is the point. Just small things like this make it such an awesome experience.
Ok ill jump into the plot now ;-) 
There are 7/8 arcs
Hunter Exam arc, Zoldyck arc, Heavens Arena, York New, Greedo Islando, Chimera Ant, And the Election Arc.
Everyone says the Zoldyck family arc is trash, and I dont even agree it is an arc, so well just skip it. 
The Hunter Exam arc is just delightful if you know youre going to stick through it. Its just plain fun, but seems to lack any depth at all. It introduces Hisoka, which was baller, but other than that, this is mostly forgettable. 
The Heavens Arena arc is also pretty hated. Its essentially a really weirdly formatted tournament arc that also doubles as our intro to Nen, the pretty interesting magic system. I enjoyed it because of the awesome fights, but very little meaning is gained here to. It really developed Hisoka a lot tho.
York New is a fan favorite, and I agree. Its basically a noir, with the best villains in the series. Its dark and so suspenseful. It just didn't hit me with any emotions, which is why Im not the biggest fan, but its obviously one of the best done.
Greedo Islando was awesome imo. This one is semi hated due to the absolute 0 amount of value it adds to the overall story, but because of how this rides so well off of Gon's previous character, and how the format is just so simple and easy to follow, I quite enjoyed this one. 
Then the Chimera Ant arc. Best arc ever? Maybe. The story here can only be described as epic. So many 3D characters, amazing emotion, and character arcs that are beyond my comprehension. Keep in mind, the pacing here is almost trash. Like, 4 episodes go by and they're like ""oh yes, 10 seconds have passed"" which isn't much on its own, but with how much the narrator talks, basically nothing happens.  Still, overall the amount of conflicts going on has floored me. This arc would probably be a 10/10. Except for the narrator, who just wouldn't shut up about obvious things, and also talked about not obvious things that the story should have *shown* us instead. This man is just annoying, but people like him for some reason. The Chimera Ant Arc just loses so much steam with him imo. Still, this arc has the most emotion, making me cry so hard at some points.
Election Arc. I enjoyed this one more than any other. It was so funny, I legit laughed out loud so many times. Its so believable too. The comedy here is sooooo top tier. Not just that tho, we get a look at the Zodiacs, which are my favorite team in HxH. The most powerful hunters in a single room. This is one of those concepts that just makes me more hyped than anything, but that might just be me. This one just ticked all the boxes. Fast moving, fun, hype, and has an awesome new character revealed ;-)
Overall the ending was mad amazing too. Perfectly concluded, despite the manga actually not even being close to done. I dare say, the ending just made me feel so warm, it might even say it changed my life. 
OK TIME FOR THE ART
Art lags at the start. Basic but consistent. Nothing too fancy.
Until the Chimera Ant Arc. Man! The amount of times they just took a still frame of the animation and painted it to the likes of an actual work of art... I saved so many of these. Basically all of them could be my wallpaper. I cannot express the beauty in the Chimera Ant Arc.
Sound was something else too. Basically same story as the art.Chimera ant arc killed it. The beauty in those tracks essentially carried the plot. It was so intense yet beautiful. Not something you could put on a playlist, but something you might hear in a theater. Its amazing. One complaint. I noticed this in the chimera ant arc and then election arc, but sometimes random circus music starts playing for like 2-4 seconds and just drops. I have no clue why this is. Maybe a Japanese thing. It just started to annoy me when I couldn't understand it at all.
Overall awesome villains, incredible plots, soundtrack and arc are jawdropping if you wait long enough, and emotions are high. Awesome series. If not for the pacing in the Chimera ant arc, the annoying narrator and the weird clown noises this would be a 10. This is prolly the highest 9 ive given tho.",9

                This anime does everything right and is so well put together, you know it has a lot of love put into it. The characters are so engaging and endearing and three-dimensional, the story is just so well-woven and well-written, the soundtracks are one of the very few soundtracks which are just ICONIC and I listen to its' openings on a daily basis, and the art just makes it what it is, amazing.
I enjoyed this anime when I was a child and it was still airing and I love it now even more after rewatching it as an older teenager. I can't believe I delayed rewatching
                  it for so long, and now the rating of 10 I've given it is more solid than before.
I reccommend all my friends to watch it and the only thing keeping them from doing so is its length. It was intimidating for me as it was my last school year but I don't regret giving this wonderful show a rewatch. Thank you so much for this wonderful underrated anime. <3",10

                The greatest flaw of this anime is that it remains an unfinished masterpiece. Truly the greatest pound for pound Shonen that exists. The main cast is full of unique and immersive characters, the only main two that stay consistent being Gon and Killua. That is where the true emotional attachment of this show comes from. Quite possibly the best bromance ever depicted on screen, their relationship feels natural and Gon's innocence and naivety interact well with Killua's knowing ways and hard upbringing. There is a reason these guys are shipped constantly/
Leorio and Kurapika are also fantastic characters, Leorio being one of my favorite characters ever
                  for his goofy yet driven nature. He provides genuinly funny comic relief ""Forget the part about me jacking off"". Kurapika is a bit more of a stereotypical moody, edgy guy out for revenge, but his story makes for a great arc and his character is deeper than the 2D description I can give. The enemies of the show also have unique and sometimes downright weird personalities. Hisoka... just watch the show and you'll know- I think if I try to describe him it is gonna get weird in here.
OK, so being a shonen, this show is structures in arcs with the loose goal of finding Ging, Gon's father. Not all the arcs are as good as each other but all have merit, the standouts being Yorknew City/ Phantom Troupe and the Chimera Ants arcs. I found the Greed Island arc to be the dullest of the arcs with the complex card rules and plain annoying group of villains, but it was a great arc for showing the boys getting stronger. 
As I said, the Chimera Ants arc was the best arc, with the payoff of the arc being very emotional, and the Netero fight was beautiful. My one criticism of this arc would be the sometimes slow pace and the overbearing nature of the narrator- probably my biggest gripe with the whole show and definitely scarred the arc. I am glad that only occurred for part of one arc rather than the whole series.
I would, despite the flaws, give this show a 10/10, but I simply cannot award perfect marks for an unfinished show- and this IS unfinished. The story is not over, loose ends and setups without payoffs plague many fans to this day. I highly recommend this show but oh boy will you be left wanting more.
Final score- 9/10, has the potential to be the best shonen ever written, perhaps it is.",9
"
                Hunter x Hunter is the best anime in the world. This is an undeniable truth, and only the haters who give him 1's deny it. 
But in short, the anime is perfect except for a few details, small flaws that don't ruin the overall quality of the anime. 
So let's all go look at it, and let's get it over with.
My review is not very extensive, but I prefer that you discover this masterpiece by yourselves. Maybe this way, your expectations won't be too high, and it will be easier for you to be surprised.
Btw, Meruem is the best antagonist, C.A arc is the best
                  arc ever, and Killua is the best character ever.",10
"
                Story. 8/10:
HxH is an anime which gives me love when it comes to thinking about the story and its characters but I hate when thinking about its rhythm and development. Its story focuses on Gon who must overcome missions to achieve his goal: find his father Ging who abandoned him after becoming a Hunter.
Unfortunately, the plot development is agonizingly slow because its battles are based solely on thoughts that are redundant and the narrator telling us things we should already know just by watching the series, plus most episodes are based solely on Gon and Killua doing basically nothing, which is very noticeable in the
                  Greed Island arc. This is bad because I sincerely think that the action that should be given in the battles (because this is a shounen) is paused, being noticed too much in the second half of the Chimera Ants arc where the narrator does not shut up for a damn second. Even so, its story is well built, telling us quite memorable stories and backgrounds which, if it weren't for its development, would make it one of the best fighting anime and super powers in history.
Art. 9/10:
The art is quite good, being worthy of being a Madhouse anime although it is nowhere near as good as Death Parade (anime from the same studio) but still, the characters are quite similar to those of the manga but adapted to what is common to see in company animes. Since I don't know much about art, the only thing I can say is that it can be seen without damaging the eyesight.
Sound. 7/10:
This is one of the worst points of the series due in large part to the opening which hardly changes over the course of all 148 episodes, besides repeating the same five songs, which are the fight song, the sad moment song, the explanation song, the tense moment song and the victory song.
Characters. 10/10:
In my opinion, this point is the best of the whole anime, because at no time do they leave any point untouched and most of the characters have some background telling us the reason for their actions, whether it is Killua who wants to get away from his family and stand up for his friends and sister, be it Ging who wants to challenge his son Gon to see if he is worthy of him, or even Aunt Mito who raises Gon as her son because she couldn't see how his father treated his son. Another great thing is that this series brings you one of the most nefarious but best developed characters in the entire anime / manga which is Meruem and is one of the only reasons to give the Chimera Ants arc a chance.
Enjoyment. 6/10:
I enjoyed this anime quite little due to its unnecessary duration that is caused by the long explanations of the narrator, the slow-motion movements of the attacks and chapters where basically nothing happens.
Overall. 8/10:
This score is due to the fact that the first two arcs (and in part the third) were quite entertaining, although it seems quite unnecessary that Leorio and Kurapika appear on the cover, since the protagonists are really Gon and Killua. In addition, its secondary characters are well developed giving us quite a few villains and memorable stories.",8
"
                First off, I want to say that Hunter x Hunter is a very well made series, with good characters, story, and art.  I really like it, but unfortunately, there are some parts that aren't so great.  
==Story==
The story of Hunter x Hunter is a good one--  a young boy goes to find his father, who has supposedly accomplished many great things.  It's engaging, hooks you, and constantly gives you a goal that you can see, even if it moves the finish line ahead by something approximating 40 episodes.  The story develops well, and keeps the comedy strong when needed, but
                  gets serious when it needs to.  Overall, the story is quite interesting, and the worldbuilding is fascinating.  
==Art==
I won't say Hunter x Hunter is a masterpiece in terms of art, but the way strange creatures are depicted, along with NEN later in the series, the portrayal of everything does wonders to supplement the story.  The recurring villains always have an air of menace, and just looking at NEN can help you see what kind of person it's attached to.  Overall, Hunter x Hunter's art just does really well as an anime.  
==Sound==
The soundtrack and SFX are great, with a great opening and endings.  Enough said
==Character==
The characters of Hunter x Hunter are done very well.  Each of them has a believable personality, and believable reasons for having such a personality, based on their background, how they were raised, and the people around them.  Gon is your standard shounen protagonist, determined, honorable, and cheerful, to the point of coming off as naïve.  He's contrasted by Killua, a boy with a very different environment growing up, and his personality fits that.  A lot of that is spoiler though, so I'll only say that.  
==Trope Subversion==
Hunter x Hunter does the unthinkable in shounen--  Gon actually loses A LOT, and is not even close to being the strongest of even the characters with a lot of screen time.  His friend, Kurapika, outclasses him in many ways for a large part of the series, and Gon technically never even beats his ""nemesis"" in Hisoka.  The way this plays out is very interesting to watch, and works out very well
==Flaws==
The main flaw with Hunter x Hunter is that it gets incredibly SLOW.  I found it difficult to get through simply because at some parts, I just lost interest.  The pacing can get quite boring, even if everything else is well done.  Because of this, I just can't give the show more than a 7.",7
"
                Hunter x Hunter is truly a ""once in a lifetime"" anime. It somehow manages to be an outright outstanding shonen series, with plenty of simple storylines and several complex ones to really keep you watching, stunning fight coordination, likeable (and sometimes purposely hateable) characters abound, and so much more.
I think what a lot of people miss if they're watching HxH passively is how it's something of a subversion of the genre as well. For every ""true good"" or ""true bad"" character, there is another one that's so morally grey, it switches up the story (I'm @ing the chimeras so hard). Shonen protagonists are often extremely
                  overpowered, and Gon is no exception. However, unlike other protags I can recall, Gon's power is treated almost as a hubris and a fault. Even little things, like some of the fights being LAUGHABLY easily won.
Hunter x Hunter is a great shonen series for all the reasons a shonen series could be great, but sticks out among the Narutos and the One Pieces by truly using the format of a shonen anime to tell a story, sinetad of forcing a story into the shonen format. It's sad that it doesn't get the same recognition as other Big 3 type anime, but I feel the overall positive reviews of the show speak well for it.",10
"
                HXH for me is an ok series, I found myself having some nice times watching the series but nothing that made it to my top 5 and here is my genuine opinion and I will try my best to give it the rating it should. I will start off by rating every arc one by one, exam - chairman election arc. The exam arc I think that the exam arc had a very bad pacing, here is an example and not just an opinion. One of the episodes in the exam arc the whole episode focused on Leorio trying to guess if a woman was
                  a woman or a men so he could advance to the next room, this whole episode focused on Leorio thinking to himself with some gags and a very quick backstory at the end of the episode. 
I myself did not enjoy this very much and it kinda bumped down some stars for me. I would also like to add that hxh has very overpowered characters, what I like about an anime is that the characters grow power as each arcs move on but yet Killua could KO everyone and Gon if not some beat ups could get back up in an instant.I like when anime such as One Punch Man do that but that being the plot of the series not an actual shonen anime where they have to grow their strengths to beat people. Killua's mansion arc, going to be a quick one did not have much problems with it showed the characters growing in order to push the gate and Gon getting beat up by the gatekeeper while trying to get in was overall one of my favorite things in this anime, however pacing was still a huge problem but I wouldn't mind if the anime kept on being like that overall a good arc I found myself enjoying. 
This was kinda ruined for me a bit tho because the next arc they completely forgot Kurapika and Leorio and just had them bought up way later on, they had such good character stories I wanted the anime to explore on but yet it took them so long that you kinda start to loose interest. Tower arc, I would have loved this arc if it wasn't for the pacing yet again, it had Gon and Hisoka fight and yet it didn't show his true potential and just like with Leorio and Kurapika you loose interest (not on yorknew city arc yet but they repeated that and didn't even show hisoka's and chrollo fight and it was the most disappointing scene on anime history ever.) Explored nen but I found myself thinking of it as a very confusing power system but maybe that's just for me so I won't take any points off.
Yorknew city arc, actually not that bad pretty amazing if I should say so myself I loved the phantom troupe members they we're all so creatively created and I love their unique powers, and now the scene which i mentioned before Hisoka vs Chrollo was so disappointing I completely lost interest after a few episodes and it totally killed the whole suspense and build up it had to it and that kinda ruined it for me since yorknew is my favorite arc of the series. Greed island arc, overall just a waste it felt like filler and the characters didn't even need to go to Greed Island even the characters said so themselves so I think it's pretty self explanatory why it's bad + phantom troupe came to greed island just because it kinda felt like they had to. 
Chimera ant arc, this arc I heard so many people loved it and I was exited for it, I was actually exited for it despite the previous arcs disappointing me in some way however I did not like it that much. I actually loved the whole humans are worse than chimera ant's kind of complex and it was a pretty cool thing that represented humanity as a whole and I really enjoyed that.
The beginning had such a bad pace and I found myself sleeping in most scenes so many times but I still kept my faith that my expectations would be turned around. 
Than came kite's death, again this was just a waste of character potential, I feel like they could have done so much with this character yet they did not, this was just another example of killing a character early and this goes to my next point. Kite being reborn was the most confusing shit i've seen on anime, I know about how his weapon lets him be reborn as the closest thing that's being born but his weapon makes no sense it has no exact power level and it just feels like random junk thrown together, I had to google multiple times the reason for his reincarnation and it's the most unsatisfying thing I have seen on anime to this day, the chimera ants we're also insanely strong and it wasn't even fun. It had one of the most confusing power levels and the chimera ants felt like goofy filler characters at times and it felt like random barf thrown together. I did like Meruem learning how to become human but I couldn't even focus when things like that we're filling up my mind and I couldn't even enjoy it when all I could think about was ""what am I watching?"" Adult Gon was such a cool scene however seeing from the damage it does it will never be explored again which is another big disappointing thing for me but I actually don't mind it much, it had such great writing.
Last but not least Chairman election arc, no problems at all felt like a good ""ending"" and I loved how Leorio expressed his feelings towards Gon and how their friendship was special and it was pretty nice to see, however I expected so much from Gon's reunion with his dad and that was not what I wanted at all, it felt so rushed for me and I did not enjoy it because I had so many scenarios on my head of how they could have met yet it was just gon meeting him at the election so another big disappointing thing for me, this arc is on my top 3 first being  Yorknew city killua's mansion than election which says a lot because chimera ant arc is way more important and longer. 
I think an anime should have a great introduction and make you want to watch what happens next but this was not the case and I kept watching because of the hype chimera ant arc had and I was midly curious, overall rating, 7-8/10. Should you watch it? Watch hunter exam arc and if that doesn't catch your attention do not watch it whatsoever, because an anime should have the basic key terms for being good a well self explanatory well written introduction, answer: no do not watch it but if your taste might be different than mine watch exam arc and figure it out for yourself.",6

                This show is a masterpiece. This show taught me a lot of things no wonder why this show is popular here in the Philippines. It taught me about friendship, goals in life, the real world, etcetera, I've even learned that rock paper scissor game was a martial art technique. 
It's a must watch for those new to anime, but just prepare yourself for the deaths of those who you will expect to live long haha. 
If your jsut going to compare the 1999 version to 2011, you're gonna fail. Both had their own ways to narrate the story and both did a great job.
                  Kudos to the staffs.
and also I just wanna say, HISOKA, ILLUMI, AND CHLORO is fine af. And also FEITAN IS LEVY (SNK) IN SOME WAYS.",10
"
                Hunter x Hunter is one of the most popular Shonen anime and one I slept on my watchlist. After seeing so many post relating to Hunter x Hunter and several recommendations I cannot help but hop up the train. Since the manga is still on-going, I keep my expectations low and savour the story served for 148 episodes. 
I thought the first arc was a good introduction to the characters; I can relate to each characters and feel for them, there is a clear motivation to where our main character, Gon, is reaching towards. There are setups and character moments that builds to interesting plot
                  points particularly on later arcs. Despite its slow start, I still enjoy the little introductory to the detour.
The second arc, personally, is my favourite, it focuses more on how the power of the show and the world building work. There is pay-off that remained very satisfying, emotionally charged between two characters I really liked. I wished the emotional drive of the story had.
The third arc is one of the strongest, this is the turning point of the tone of the series, I really like Kurapika as a character and this is the arc where he shines and an introduction to a group called the 'Phantom Troupe' some would label this arc by that name. There is that emotional pay-off and nuances for the characters that I crave and the new characters introduced were enjoyable and memorable though some of the auction stuff add the ambiguity of the underworld of HxH but some episodes for it deters the momentum of the story. Served as a breather after an intense storm. Talking about this arc more began to grew on me.
The fourth arc felt like the breather of the series but I still found certain moments entertaining. Since it is set in a video game, there is a characters introduced who will remain recurring on the later seasons, some are thrown away just for the sake of being a stepping stone to the story. What I found a bit disappointing was that they underplayed an important character from the previous arc, the significance of him just gets thrown under a bus, I just wished the author could've expanded more especially with the appearance of the jester character in the arc. The antagonist of this arc feels like a toxic player in a video game, not many layers to him and would probably remain forgettable.
The fifth arc is a mixed bag for me, I find it as an interesting take on alien invasion reminded me of Invasions of the body snatcher (1978), though the pacing is what really bogged down the story and brought bad juju to my experience, maybe because I binged most of the episodes so the majority of the episode starts off with the summary of the previous episode and there were attempts of characterisation of potential minor villains, even though they worked but it deterred and meandered away from the main focus of the arc. What worked for me was the juxtaposition of character development between the protagonist, Gon and the antagonist of this arc 'the King'. There were a couple of episodes in which narration just entered the story like it's the play of the game, it takes me away from the story, just a bunch of spoon-feeding of details that we as the audience can put two and two together. Despite all the pacing issues and underdeveloped characters there were really good emotional moments and character interactions.
The epilogue of the series is serviceable, there were entertaining moments between characters and family drama at play. It was a good transition from an emotionally draining arc and a good teaser for the future of the series, which we will probably see in 2030.
Arc Personal Ranking:
1). Heavens Arena
2). Yorknew City x Phantom Troupe
3). Election Arc (Epilogue)
4). Greed Island
5). Hunter Exam
6). Chimera Ant

                hunter x hunter is one of the greatest masterpieces i have seen,i am gonna rate this on my personal judges.
story 10/10
the story is excellent and amazing,every arc makes the experience different from the other arcs, i can't say much about the story but it makes it feel like a much different approach every time.
art 10/10
the art is amazing and makes the characters look cute and other characters look more intense, the art makes the characters give a little different feel every time.sound 7/10
i liked the sound, it has a more atmospheric approach than most others and each sound makes it more related to the scenario.
character 10/10
the characters are absolutely amazing, more colorful characters makes the anime more interesting and dark characters have even more intensive deep emotions that gave me chills like gon's character development makes it absolutely unpredictable which also makes it amazing.
enjoyment 10/10
i looking for some anime to watch at night, one of them i found was hunter x hunter, i kept watching and then shit keeps getting interesting which ended by me watching the whole anime so i can definitely say that my enjoyment was the best
overall, it's a extremely great anime, the arcs felt different every time and the unpredictable was the best, so it's one hell of a anime",10

                Hunter x Hunter was so good it had me questioning my top anime list of all-time. Almost everything in this series was laid out perfectly, and despite the hate the Chimera Ant arc receives, I personally think it is a masterpiece. One aspect I really enjoyed was the use of brain over brawn a lot of the times. This is why the final battle in the series was very satisfying. I loved the execution of it too, Gon finally had gone all-out. But as it is with any fiction series, there are also flaws. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. Now then, I believe the way Gon had
                  returned back to full strength was absolute BS, even I could see Alluka was drafted in for plot convenience. Another thing I would have liked to improve is the way Gon found Ging in the finale. After all the effort Gon had put in to find Ging, him finding him by accident at a bloody auditorium was not very satisfying. Other than that, the series was almost perfect. Hope it comes off its long hiatus.",9
"
                Im quite surprised people would rate hxh 1-4, because it is quite far from that rating. But I don't think it deserves a solid 10, either. No spoilers, except arc names. Summary at the end!
Here is my experience watching HXH(skippable, just wanna share it):
I have been hearing of this show from a friend's facebook timeline quite a lot, and originally just planned to watch it with plans of being just a yknow, half-assed fan. Or.. a quarter-assed fan. With my younger brother. First arcs were hella enjoyable and though ive heard the show was dark, I was like ""ah I guess its just a little
                  dark. Totally normal, that kinda twist happens."" Until I get to the fourth(Phantom Troupe) arc and realise Im a clown. Now my expectations become high, since the arc did a solid job at delivering what it wanted to deliver. I come to the fifth (Greed Island) Arc, twas ok but lost shine. Then finally sixth(Chimera Ant) arc, the notorious one, and I was instantly left disappointed at the first 15 episodes. It was quite boring. BUT. My love for this show has exceeded past disappointment and I planned finishing it no matter what. And fortunately, I began to see the best of Chimera Ant arc and why it was famous. Originally, I am quite a cold hearted bitch when it comes to anime and rarely cry and dwell on it(exceptions of haikyuu whenever my fav shows end). But oh boy did this show made me soft as hell. In the end, Id still recommend this to a friend. 
Story problems:
PACING. Definitely pacing. The author was amazing at writing the climax, but needed more work with improving of his writing for build-up. This is the exact driving force of why some people say HXH became worse as it carried on, when in truth the plot and characterization get deeper. This is why for most, including me, Greed Island and the first episodes of Chimera Ant arcs were boring. It was too slow-paced, and some episodes just dragged on for too long. There were great story ideas for build up, but I think its the execution or the length that made it gray. However, the climax is definitely worth waiting for.
Art:
I dont see any problems, theyre all delightful to my eyes.
Sound:
not a pro in the music department, but in the eyes of a normal watcher I loved the soundtracks. I never really cared about osts(im sorry) but for hxh soundtracks id gladly listen. 
Character:
Gorgeous. HXH takes a reaaallly lovely twist for the characters. Dont suspect that they are what they are just by the surface.  I dont wanna give much clues, since its a gift. Something I also didnt expect, even though I had the knowledge that HXH would be dark.
Enjoyment:
9. That 1 thats missing from my score is due to the boredom I felt in a number of episodes, the buildup episodes I talked about. But other episodes? *orgasm* (jk no pls dont jail me)
Overall/SUMMARY:
8, the 2 thats missing is due to the slow pace and the effect of some lackluster episodes. Like ive said earlier, def would recommend to a friend. Unexpectedly I became a full fan. Its been 2 months, I still think about hxh a lot.... might need help but thats just how much I love it. Please watch this show, it has amazing writing. Sure it has flaws, and every show has but its one thats still worthy. Very worthy.",8
"
                I love Hunter x Hunter. By far the most fun I have had watched an anime. I had heard a lot of hype going into it and I was very excited to watch my first long anime series. Immediately I fell in love with the characters. Gon, Killua, Kurapika, Hisoka. some of my favorites in the beginning.
This show does an excellent job at continuously giving the plot something to work towards like a goal. There's is no real downtime and no parts where I was bored besides maybe the Chimera Ant arc simply because it dragged on for a long time. But even that I
                  still loved it because the story was just so excellent.
I think that each arc does a great job at telling a unique and exciting story while also progressing Gon and Killua to their overall story of finding Ging. Each arc they become smarter and stronger. They meet more friends and experience new things.
This is my favorite anime that I have watched so far and I really hope that they end up continuing the story with the Mangas that are out right now. Overall this show deserves a 10. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't actually have an ending and who knows maybe it never will. ;(",10
"
                When they say ""Wait 'til you get to the Chimera Ant arc"", they aren't fucking around. 
I'm choosing to write this as more of a loose structuring of my thoughts after finishing this absolutely stellar anime, rather than breaking my review into separate, organized components.
I also wanted to comment on how all of the top reviews are 10s. I thought it was ""undeserved"" and ""exaggerated"" at first, but believe me, this show is 100% a 10. 
Hunter x Hunter is commonly referred to by many as the ""greatest shounen of all time"", and while FMA:B currently holds a higher rating here, I think if the
                  statement were amended to ""greatest traditional shounen of all time"" it would be undoubtedly true.
Though the pacing can be a bit of a slog at times, specifically during some of the earlier arcs, it's HxH's ability to consistently improve, with each arc (post-Heaven's Arena, good lord what a drag) better than the last (with Chimera Ant being the peak, but let's just pretend that the Election Arc doesn't really count).
HxH also excels in its ability to develop its characters in a realistic manner, without succumbing to some of the classic shounen tropes like power escalation, and further manages to create attainable goals for each of the characters and managing to deliver on many of those goals throughout the show's runtime. 
I'm now realizing as I'm typing this up that it's really difficult to collect my thoughts on how absolutely wonderful this show is without spoiling anything, so I guess my bottom line is: just try this show. Yes, as I stated before the pacing can be a little problematic, and not all of the episodes are amazing, but the end product, the destination, will make you remember just what you and all of the characters went through to get there. There are plenty of unforgettable, heartfelt, and magnificent moments scattered throughout this show, and it was a genuine blast and a privilege to bear witness to what HxH has to offer. 
Keep in mind, this show will probably never be finished, but what currently exists is absolutely splendid and well worth the effort to watch. Enjoy yourselves, and thank me later.",10

                Story: 10/10
The story to Hunter x Hunter is simply amazing and truly sets a mood. The story in HxH flip flops between light and dark arcs and does it extremely cleanly and well.
Art: 10
Came out in 2011, but has some of the best animation I've ever seen. The manga was adapted extremely well in all areas including this one.
Sound: 10
The sound in HxH is extremely well made. The sound helps the atmosphere to be how it should and succeeds in this very well. It is also very well produced to where it feels amazing. Also, watch this in Japanese, Eng Dub for this is trash
Characters:
                  10
The characters are all overall very well made. My favorite character of all time is Killua, one of the main characters. The main 4 in the first arc are Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio. They all have very unique and distinct personalities with great backstories. The Japanese voice acters for basically every character in the show is amazing as well.
Enjoyment: 10
The first 4-7 eps are kinda boring but it is well worth watching them still. It sets up the rest of the show, which has no filler and is always entertaining. It has 2 10/10 arcs imo where the entire thing is entertaining ( Except 1 is low-key ruined if u watch it in English ngl ).
Overall: 10
Hunter x Hunter is without a doubt my favorite show of all time and definitely will be forever too. All of the elements of this show are unbeatable for humans. God gave the production team and Yoshihiro Togashi an amazing gift that they did not use in vein. 10/10",10

                Before I start the review, keep in mind that this is my first review and that Hunter x Hunter is my favorite anime of all time, so this may not be the best review out there. Hunter x Hunter (pronounced Hunter Hunter) is, to it’s very core, a shounen, and uses probably every shounen trope out there, except, this is not a bad thing because every single trope is written perfectly, and has a reason other than “cause it’s a shounen”. A major strength of Hunter x Hunter, in my opinion (which means it is objectively correct), are all the little things, and what I
                  mean by that is that every little detail enhances the the story somehow and is presented at the right time. Every character in Hunter x Hunter is either narratively or thematically important in some way and all will have a reason to be where they are, when they are and have a purpose in the story. The power system is nen, which is very complex with defined rules, but the complexity and defined rules allow for very unique and creative abilities that can also add upon the characters themselves. Hunter x Hunter is truely flawless, but if there was a flaw it would definitely be exposition, because while nearly all exposition in Hunter x Hunter is written into scenes beautifully, there are times when it is just not needed. Overall, Hunter x Hunter is perfect and goes above and beyond with nearly everything, making it a must-watch for all living organsims. 10/.00008791",10

                Definitely raised my standards for anime by a longshot. There was not a single moment in the show that i did not enjoy. Heck, i rewatched it almost four times already. The thing i most treasure about this show has got to be the characters.
When I was first introduced to Hunter x Hunter, my expectations were low. It was mid 2015 and i was only told that it was about a kid looking for his dad. However, i still gave it a shot anyway. And I am glad I did.

                Hunter x Hunter is rather impressive for a long-running shounen anime in the fact I haven’t been seriously hooked on a title within the demographic for years until I started seeing it back in October and completed it just tonight. Focused on the adventures of Gon Freecss, this young man attempts to become a Hunter, a licensed and elite member of society tasked with hunting anything such as treasures, rare beasts, or other humans. Making friends during his journey, Gon attempts to learn details about the whereabouts of his father and famous Hunter, Ging, while improving on his abilities as a Hunter.
Hunter x Hunter is
                  notable for being a deconstruction for many conventional storytelling and character cliches you may find among long-running shounen action/ adventure titles. It is still set in a fantastical world featuring characters with supernatural abilities you would find in any popular shounen title like Naruto or Bleach. But unlike those titles, Hunter x Hunter offers up a more grounded, mature, and practical exploration of its world and the challenges faced by its characters.
Let’s first start by exploring the one major area Hunter x Hunter excels compared to many long-running shounen titles in that it doesn’t waste time with its storytelling. Many of the typical ways that shounen titles would expand their length such as dragged-out battles, glacial pacing, and filler arcs are nowhere to be found in the series. There are a couple recap episodes found during the earlier episodes in the Hunter Arc, but Hunter x Hunter eventually ditches those all together. Every episode within the series has a reason to take place to explore its world, develop its characters, further advance whatever story arc it is currently in, and/or show how major characters are affected by the events of said story arc. With 148 episodes, the series has more than enough time to develop many of its plot and character elements, while progressing its storytelling at a fairly smooth pace. The only shortcoming with Hunter x Hunter’s plotting is that it lacks a conclusive ending, with some plot threads left unresolved due to its manga source material still being ongoing and having no end in sight thanks to mangaka Yoshihiro Togashi’s frequent hiatuses with advancing the series.
Hunter x Hunter’s battle system with the use of Nen is a noteworthy element to the series as it serves as the means for many major characters to utilize their special abilities. Like many shounen titles, the anime does go into great detail on the applications, capabilities, and limitations that come with using abilities based around Nen. However whereas many shounen titles will depict the characters either defying their limitations or bending its rules for the sake of storyline convenience, Hunter x Hunter firmly sticks with the rules laid out for its use of Nen. A number of characters do have Nen abilities limited in application, work under specific conditions, or are not meant to be used in battle conditions. As a result, they have to plan out how to utilize their ability to their fullest in whatever limited circumstances they have for it, thus a good number of conflicts in Hunter x Hunter revolve more around strategy and tactical planning over power struggles between ridiculously powerful characters. The series also has a few points where it shows some serious consequences that can result from Nen users trying to go beyond whatever natural limitations they have, one such example sticking out as a major dramatic event within the series with the life-threatening circumstances that result from it.
Another strong element that sticks out with Hunter x Hunter is its character development. Many of the show’s characters get a great deal of fleshing out and development throughout the show’s run and respond realistically to the various situations that develop within each story arc of the series. In particular, Gon’s character development sticks out as he is shown to deconstruct the “young, naive, and good-natured hero” character type seen within many shounen titles. While Gon has many of the typical traits of this character type, his determination to uphold vows and protect others is shown to usually be self-destructive or self-serving in some of his conflicts and his inexperience on understanding more morally gray areas of the human condition does drive him into ideological conflicts with others at points, particularly during the Chimera Ant arc. Characterization isn’t perfect as there are some major characters that felt underdeveloped and could have been more fleshed out, particularly Hisoka and the members of the Phantom Troupe.
While not perfect in some facets, Hunter x Hunter is still one of the best shounen anime titles I’ve had a pleasure within recent years thanks to its strong characterization and storytelling, as well as deconstructing many elements of shounen action and adventure titles. It may not be for anyone who has more interest in the typical elements of shounen action anime. But for those craving something different within the genre and don’t mind the rather intimidating 148-episode length of the series, Hunter x Hunter is a series I would strongly recommend checking out at some point.",8

                BEAUTIFUL!!
I dont have other words to describe this masterpiece, it looks like is a normal shounen but when the story goes on you see that it has more profundity that you think it seems like it's a lie but it gets better every time you watch the series again, I've seen it 2 times and I'm watching it again for the third time, for my taste it's the best shounen I've seen, the opening is beautiful, it's my second favorite, I also recommend the opening of Tokyo Ghoul, Unravel, it is my favorite and it sounds very good, I can not say the same about
                  the series but it is good.
I got off topic, most of the arches are beautiful and have nothing to ask for, the chimera ants arc expanded a bit but it doesn't have a filler chapter and only has 2 compilation chapters.
I do not give everything 10 because in some parts it lacked exciting things, but in general it deserves a 10. It probably does not have the most striking visual at the beginning but believe me, it improves with the passage of the chapters to a very good point for 2011 .
This is my humble opinion, I do not force you to see it, but to consider that it may be worth seeing.
Thanks for reading all this :> <3",10

                I wish I'd watched this sooner, rather than later. I love the world that they live in and watching them explore it, and how we're on that journey with them. There's a lot to explain and not enough time per episode to explain it, which is great, because it rationalizes why the story is so long. The characters are diverse and interesting but also not cliched. Killua and Leorio were my favourite characters because they had the best character motivations. It has battles both mental and physical and sometimes both, battles are far more thrilling when there's a mental component as well; rather he with
                  the higher power level shall prevail. The peril is made clear and defeat has fatal consequences here. One other note worthy point is that HxH is far more coed than I would have imagined, despite the four main characters being male. There's none of the fan service and misogyny that can be viewed as a negative. It is for kids after all and it seems like a perfect gateway anime. I have to admit, it's everything one loves in the shonen epic genre. So why didn't I like it more? I'm not 12 years old and no longer wish to view the world with such eyes. This makes Gon's naivety and innocence kind of unrelatable [i]to me[/i]. If it wasn't for the Zoldyck family I doubt I would've finished this series. Also at 148 episodes it feels both incomplete and too long. Yes, I would have loved to have seen more, but given the stories they tell, I wouldn't mind if it was shorter. Not seeing Leorio's training, growth and development was kind of a bummer but what can you do? Needless to say if you haven't watched it, watch it. On a personal note; I'd say, ""If you watched every episode of Naruto Shippuden and are pondering if you should watch HxH; do yourself a favor and watch this! you won't be sorry you did, but the producers of Naruto might.",8
"
                **SPOILERS AHEAD**
Story: 6
HxH is a mixed bag. Even though the story's main focus is Gon and his journey, HxH is a show that doesn't shy away from pushing side characters to the spotlight. Consisting of 7 different arcs, each arc has different characters highlighted, different villains, and even a different theme, tone and setting. These arcs are not combined well to an overarching storyline, they are mostly presented as seperate journeys that develop the main characters. So it's only fair to review the story of each arc seperately. I do not want to create a wall of text however, so I'll give short reviews.
Hunter Exam:
                  7
Though some of the 'fights' were too simple or bland, this arc served as a good introduction to the fascinating world of Hunters and the main characters.
Zoldyck Family Arc: 6
Good introduction to the interesting assassin family and the butlers but it was cut rather short.
Heaven's Arena Arc: 8
Light-hearted, and one of the better arcs of the series. The nen system is finally introduced, and is explained in great detail in the following arcs. Killua and Gon develop a sweet friendship as they tackle some simple obstacles. This arc also had one of the best fights of the entire series (Hisoka x Kastro) showcasing HxH's focus on strategy over powerlevel.
Yorknew City Arc: 5
The show does a fine job switching its tone at will, but Kurapika fell short as the main character. Troupe had few interesting villains too, so it felt like the plot didn't have anyone to lean on. The fights were also less strategic than the previous arcs. Although the final 5-6 episodes got better with the troupe being further developed and Gon/Killua getting more involved, overall I felt the arc was below HxH average.
Greed Island Arc: 7
More Gon x Killua training bromance in a different setting, with a better teacher. The card system was interesting and the dodgeball competition was great. But this arc also had the weakest villain (bomber) and the strategies remained rather simple for the most part.
Chimera Ant Arc: 9
Though it had its flaws (overnarration and Kite's development), this arc was by far the most ambitious and interesting one. The creator did an amazing job with the ants, and you can feel how much he cared for the arc. From Meruem and Komugi to the royal guards and from the queen and her soldiers to the newly introduced hunters, every character was sufficiently explored and fit well in the story. It also happens to be the longest arc by far, and in my opinion it's the arc that makes HxH special.
Hunter Chairman Arc: 3
I couldn't care much less about this arc. The whole arc felt like plot convenience and the zodiacs didn't catch my interest at all. Gon's revival and his reunion with Ging didn't give me much satisfaction. The ending also felt incomplete with lots of things unresolved. Overall, it felt like a bad transition to the light-hearted tone and a forced happy ending.
Overall the story had its ups and downs. It had great pacing throughout but excluding the Chimera Ant Arc, the plot remained too simplistic since each arc did its own thing instead of building on the previous one. It's not necessarily a bad thing however, as Ging says:
""You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want.""
I believe that's what HxH highlights with its arcs, it focuses on the characters, their interactions, their journey more than an all-embracing story.
Art and Sound: 6
I think this is one part HxH isn't great at. Apart from Hisoka's theme, I found all of the music mediocre and forgettable. It does have a wide array of tracks to cover its different tones though.
I think the animation was consistent and handled tonal shifts well. Some fights like Meruem x Netero was a blast to watch but most of the time the animation was just 'good' for 2011, nothing that special. 
Characters: 9
This is where HxH excels at. It doesn't just have colorful, memorable but generic characters like Naruto. It develops its main characters extremely well but the side characters are also very unique and developed enough so you can relate to their goals and personalities. Especially the Chimera Ant was amazing in this aspect with its great 'villains'. In terms of characters, I think HxH is up there with FMAB.
However the show has a bad habit of throwing away good potential. Leorio,Kurapika and Chrollo come to mind as examples. Chrollo and Kurapika basically vanished after the Troupe arc completely to never return and Leorio had a short return for.. elections? Personally I'd have liked to see more of them after they were developed so much.
Enjoyment: 7
Overall, HxH is a good shounen. For me it was kind of hit and miss with its arcs but if not for anything, it's worth a watch for its glorious Chimera Ant Arc and eccentric villains like Pouf and Hisoka.",7

                (will try not to spoil, no promises! O and Merry Christmas! :D)
So a friend of mine finally managed to convince me to watch this anime. And many years ago I saw scenes on youtube, so curiosity finally got the better of me and I decided to give it a shot, this popular anime that I see as one of the ""mainstream"" anime. So I watched it, I bingewatched it and 1,5 week later I finished it. Wew!
He warned me of a boring first couple of episodes, but they were honestly not that bad, I really enjoyed the first one actually.  He also told me
                  of amazing scenes and touching scenes, and that there were going to be some 'real life' parts in there, 'disturbing' scenes, said it can turn dark and that this anime isn't all jolly for these more serious parts. So that reeled me in pretty much.
The anime is mainly about Gon, a boy trying to find his father who left his family behind to become a hunter. So Gon wants to become a hunter too, to search for his father. On the way he meets other characters like Leorio, Kurapika and Killua. This third one grows really close to Gon and they become very close friends. From then on the story will be about the both of them. 
You see both their motives, their stories, their approaches, their struggles. You see them improve and train together, I love it. Character development. Also they are like the main characters in the shows, but they get their ass handed to them. Plot armor doesn't make them invincible like some shows would have them.But you see them struggle together and work hard to try and beat the next obstacle.
There are a few things that bored me a little, and when I think about what these things are, I'm like, yep that's THREE things in 148 episodes, which isn't that bad :) of course it's subjective! One of them is...politics. Those who watched will understand.
And the good scenes? Yeah there are a lot of awesome memorable scenes in there. Some of the fights/Challenges or just simple word exchanges that left me satisfied, shaking or holding my breath. 
My favorite ARC: The...CHIMERA ARC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *dramatic music*
I think it'll be the favorite one for many people, there are just so many episodes and scenes that got me hunger for the next episode. Hell, I watched 148 episodes over the course of 1 week and a half, I was hooked, I threw away an already crappy sleeping schedule and averaged 4 AM, especially during this ARC.
That arc had me hold my breath, shake, ... oh and cry. Yep I cried, a few times. Friend warned me about certain episodes. He didn't spoil it, he just mentioned the episode number. I was like ""I'll be the judge of that""...and after the episode I was like ""yeah u right"" LOL sorry, this happened a few times. After that episode he put up another episode number, and I broke down again despite feeling 'prepared', but I was so wrong.
One episode that really had me filled with several emotions like Anger, Sadness, Pity, Fear and Admiration. I'm talking about that infamous episode 116.
The Animation in there...The Sounds...And my GOD the Voice Acting was...sublime. Episodes like that had me immersed, hooked, and it's this rollercoaster of feelings that I'm after when it comes to watching anime, if you can give me that, I can only say 'thank you', 'waw', 'I tip my hat to you'. It's art.
I recommend it, I really do, give it a shot! Just don't sacrifice your sleeping schedule over it. I just finished it a couple of days ago, discussed with a friend and as I'm writing this we have just reached 5 AM. I'm off to bed now, tired, but happy that I watched it, and sad that it's over....on to the next anime I suppose! :3
Cheers!",8

Overall:9
Hunter x Hunter is one of the greatest anime.The story is an all out 10 but I'm giving it a 9 because of some certain reasons. They could've added many things more in the story which would've made the story much cooler. Such as a cool fight between hisoka and chrollo. They could've done more justice to hisoka the character is so freaking interesting. They also could've shown a backstory of Ging. Probably everyone was interested in seeing actually how powerful ging was. And also kurapika and leorio were in like at a max of 40 episodes they should've been included more. But 1 thing
                  the friendship of gon and killuya touched my heart. And overall HxH is a pretty good anime!
Thanks for reading till the end.",7

                Oh boy lets go, this is my first review, and i couldn´t begin if it weren´t my favorite anime of all time. Hunter x hunter is a masterpiece it drags everything a good show would love to have. I have to begin with a quick synopsis and what i feel about each arc to give my note about the series, so sorry for the long review, and lets go.
The beggining of the show (the first 3 episodes) is a little slow and can be kind of boring to watch, but you didn´t expect what was coming next. The first arc, the hunter exams arc is
                  a typical shonens adventure, it presents the 4 main characters each one with certain pecularities, then goes for an arc full of adventures in different situations, is a very enjoyable arc one of the most funny of the show. Then you have the zoldyck family arc, an intermediate arc that doesn´t have much to present, but it serves the purpose to present to the audience killua´s prologue, his character desenvolviment and his problems. The third arc, the heavens arena arc, introduce us one of the gratest abilities in anime history, it present us nen, it´s meaning and how does it work, it begans to show the abilities of the characters and where the anime is going, also, have one of the best fights of the entire anime. Then there is the yorknew city arc, this arc focus much more in kurapika (the other arcs focused more in gon and killua) showing his development as character and in his abilities. this arcs presents us the genei ryodan (the phanton troup) wich are one of the main antagonists in the anime, following hisoka and illumi. This arc show us that the story could be deeper and it is not tangled with only a few characters, it also desenvolves the potencial of nen and how nen can be used. The fifht arc, the greed island arc is one of the best one in anime, it desenvolves the killua and gon friendship and has a great objective to reach there. The you have it. One of the most beautifull and philosophical history in anime, the chimera ants arc is a great arc that explore all the anime has built so far, the world in wich it is placed, the characters, the abilities, even the narration. Everything in this arc is great. Finally we have the ellection arc. After the first arc, it is the funniest one, and it ends the series in an wonderfull way.
Well, there you have it, hunter x hunter is one of the best things you are going to watch your entire life, it has adventure, thriller, action, comedy and friendship moments, it has a beautifull work of art, every fight is incredible, the original soundtrack is amazing, every song has a meaning, and it launchs you perfectly in the situation the anime wants to the audience fells. The characters are unique, it wouldn´t be very special at all, but the relationships between then are wonderfull, it makes you fell a lot of emotions, like happiness, fear or sadness, you can fell what the characters are feeling. The story is simply amazing and fluid you can watch several episodes in a row, it is freaking perfect and enjoyable. It is clear a 10/10 for me and if you wanna know more about it read the manga (but you will live in the sadness of the long hiatus arc), i hope everybody enjoys it and has a wonderfull experience, if you want someone to talk about it feel free to talk to me, and have a great time watching it.",10

                Hunter x Hunter is a shounen anime with a small difference and a few awesome characters. By no means is this anime for everybody, except for fans of long running shounen, or anyone who wants to try it out, I’d highly recommend it. Being a remake of a 90-s anime it still looks like an old anime with one solid opening and multiple changing endings. The series is wonderful but it isn’t really meant for action oriented anime viewers because it puts strategy before the rest. Although it is a master at creating an exciting world that we’ve never experienced with the concept of the
                  Hunters’ Association, the gorgeous display of the “power of friendship” and one-of-a-kind tricks employed in the show.
HxH indeed for it's time back in 2011 had great art and animation. It amazes me how a long-running series like HxH delivers consistent quality animation episode after episode, especially during the fights. The series does a superb job of capturing facial expressions and everything from the lighting, shading and colours adjust perfectly as per the mood of the arc. The bright colours of the show fits it perfectly. And adds to the charm of the series by complementing its sense of adventure, uplifting atmosphere and unique appeal as a shounen that appears simple but is kind of deep. The ost is nice, but they have a tendency to re-use the identical tracks often so there’s an absence of variety. They also tend to forget earlier songs later within the series.
When it comes to Main Protagonists, Gon is simple-minded, tenacious, innocent and sweet. He isn’t excellent with math though and isn’t very bright. He may seem like the typical Shonen main character with his happy go lucky character, his innocent point of view and even his style of childish manner. plenty of things about him can attach you with this guy even to the point of sharing his hopes and dreams. At the start of this series, Gon befriends Kurapika who is on a revenge-seeking path to murder those that killed his brethren and recover the eyes that were stolen. Leorio, who is on his quest to become a doctor whereby being a Hunter will give the connections and opportunity to attain this dream. Killua encompasses a hidden past of an assassin which has been an element of his heritage from the foremost powerful assassin family within the world.Killua Zoldyk (the second lead) is an assassin from the Zoldyk family. bored with killing he decided to run far away from home (stabbing his mother in progress) and become a hunter. He’s skilled and powerful as everyone within the family is born to be the right assassins. Cool, calm and picked up Killua was born to kill as his name suggests. He often puts survival above the rest and knows when to run away. This kid isn’t to be messed with!
Killua was an amazing character in terms of his friendship with Gon and the way their relationship and trust grows together. He wants to shield his friends to the point of forgetting what he trained from his birth. Apart from that I love his character design too. He really is a cool character.
The evil killers within this anime are extremely formidable and Gon and his comrades should find a way to defeat them. In some instances, it’s like guaranteed death, yet Gon heads straight into battle. Gon may be a gullible and foolish boy but throughout you tend to praise his inability to give up and withstand any torment he receives. This anime features different enemies/comrades as the team progresses through the Hunters exam, meet the Zoldyck family, face the Phantom Troupe, and battle the Chimera Ants. Every arc is epic and keeps you asking the question of what’s going to happen next.
The show introduces us to several interesting antagonists like Hisoka, Illumi, and Meruem, the King of the Chimera Ants, but Hisoka and Illumi are two of the anti-heroes that we see consistently throughout the series. Hisoka Morow, the perverted clown, is described as a magician and serial murderer who combines his magic tricks with violence and becomes ecstatic about battling those he considers strong to the point of really getting sexually aroused by it. Hisoka is simply brilliant. Weird, I know, but as a villain he’s great. He’s not always against the main characters, but that’s because he’s insane. There’s some style of logic behind his actions, though it only makes sense to him. He’s terrifyingly strong, and his weapon of choice is playing cards. Why? because he’s a badass.Illumi Zoldyck is Killua’s older brother. The sole barely positive relationship he forms within the series is an unusual relationship with Hisoka, which he describes as “give-and-take”. Illumi is a stony, ruthless person with a particularly cold way of thinking and far like Hisoka reflects solely on his own interests.
The kind of intense battles that happen between Gon and Hisoka, Kurapika and also the Phantom Troupe, and lots more will showcase brutal power, sacrifice, strategy and an undeniable growth in power from each fight because the characters develop and understand their true strength.
One complaint I do have about the arcs is solely the length of one of them. Not that the arc is bad in any way. It’s just that in many episodes of this arc the narrator would state the obvious which I feel made the show longer. And there’s a time where the timeline slows to a literal halt. Like, two episodes of a group of people trying to climb up a flight of stairs slowly.
Yoshihiro Togashi is an intensely thoughtful writer, and it is visible in this series. While Hunter x Hunter is an adventurous and action-packed story, it often takes breaks to explore the unique philosophies of the heroes and villains. This makes this anime unique and captivating with some fundamental changes to the format. This isn’t a story about Gon or any of his friends alone. It’s the story of a world with Gon as our guide. He isn’t the most powerful character of the series, but he’s the scope with which we view many stories. While it’s hard to pin down the series’ exact attempts to talk on the shonen anime, this is more like a glance at the genre that’s unique and powerful. It’s completely different to the series that share space with it.
The art style largely mimics what came before, but each character features a unique and memorable design that lends itself well to the character’s role within the story. Moreover, there are details to the character designs that evolve with their situations. The background is colorful and vibrant and surprisingly dense.
It is deep and complex with action that’s multi-layered and stories that are impressively deep. Yoshihiro Togashi has crafted a world that’s expensive with a tale that takes noticeable risks at every turn. The sole problem with the anime is that it ends early. Although its run barely includes a weak episode, it doesn’t conclude with a satisfying send-off simply because the story of this world remains evolving. Due to Togashi’s not so consistent writing schedule, the anime couldn’t go further without making up the remainder. This leaves a great series with many loose ends, basically saying that the journey has only begun and presumably never ends. this may be more satisfactory than wading through the endless tales of larger anime, watching it slip, but it does dampen the thrill for a good show.
There are parts of the anime where you’ve got the cliche development of skills within Gon and his friends. But even within these parts, the anime isn’t afraid to point out its true colours with murder and deception.
Hunter x Hunter exists as something of a rarity. Despite being of the Shounen genre and boasting a lofty 148 episode quota, it bears no filler material, beyond a mere two recap episodes. The show‘s avoidance of this practice is commendable, but alas, this praise becomes heavily devalued when — despite sticking firmly to its primary plot — Hunter x Hunter groggily crawls to its goal at a snail’s pace, with many moments being extended for a mind-numbingly long period time, very like this sentence just being stretched for ages, and ages, and ages, growing progressively more boring and mundane as they drag on, and on, and on, and this sentence, as stated earlier, is an accurate representation of that, as it should have ended way back, but it just seems to drag on for forever, and…okay you get the point.
Hunter x Hunter does boast an intriguing cast of versatile characters, but the most effective of them are aggressively brushed aside. Gon and Killua’s developing friendship, whilst mostly enjoyable to witness, becomes repetitive in time. In these moments of character-related tedium, the accompaniment of others (such as Kurapika, Leorio, and Hisoka) would have provided an urgently required sense of variation to HxH‘s narrative. Kurapika and Leorio, despite playing a significant role at the beginnings of Gon’s journey, make extremely few appearances throughout the remainder of the series (with the exception of the Kurapika-helmed Yorknew City arc, which happens to be the strongest story that the show presents). Hisoka, the most interesting character on offer, is frustratingly underutilized too. Although given significantly more screen time than the aforementioned Kurapika and Leorio, he’s still inexplicably absent throughout the Chimera Ant arc.
In summary, I think that this anime is beautifully written. I recommended Hunter x Hunter for anyone who enjoys a build-up to ultimate death-defying battles which are tactically thought out. Starts off childish but quickly ramps up to something incredibly evil. Extended battles are epic with sick villains and with a world-like realism where the nice guy doesn’t always win.

                Anime title: Hunter x Hunter (2011)
English name:  Hunter x Hunter
Number of episodes: 148
Genre: Adventure, fantasy, fighting, magic, super power
MAL rating: 9.12
The reason I watched this:  I was asked by two people to watch the anime. I had previous watch the old version of hunter x hunter (1999) and they said that this one goes further than the original. After hearing that it goes further, that gave me another reason to watch it. I didn't want to watch it right away till the 1999 version was more or less forgotten from my head in terms of the voice acting and the detail of the
                  arcs.
Story:  The story take places in where super power and currently technology live side by side. There are weird creature that are treated like humans. The story is about a boy named Gon, who lives in whale island. After being told what really happened to his father, him abandoning Gon and becoming a hunter. Gon wanted to know what it like and also find his father. His belief is that his father left to become a hunter and that must mean that being a hunter is amazing. So we follow this boy in his adventure to be a hunter and to find his father.
My Thoughts:  I really enjoyed the anime. I would say there some slight differences from 1999 to 2011 version. Like in the beginning the 1999 was more detail, but the more it went on the 2011 became more detail with information. Then there was like 2 arcs that was added past the 1999 version. I love the action and fighting that were done in the anime. The thing I didn't like was the slow pace that I detected during the anime. The new arcs I would say is a little more darker tone than the rest but I didn't hate it because of the shift.
Rating time
Plot: The anime has one main plot and within that 6 sub arcs. There is a lot of detail in these arcs. The tone shift in the arc changes around arc 5. I liked that there were lot of them. The issue I had with some of the arcs is the amount of length it took to complete it. The pace felt kind of slow. The action of the anime when it focus on Gon were great. I liked that there was more to watch after the 1999 version. 8/10
Animation:  The animation of the show was great. The good news is that I have something to compare and completely destroy the old one. The animation from character design to aura that they have were awesome. I like the different animation used based on the context. Funny animation when Gon got trolled or when someone is super happy kind of thing. When one person is mad had great animation to. 10/10
Sound: The sound were also great. I watched the anime in Japanese. The voice actor are a little different from the 1999 version but they sound better. Hisoka sounds much better (different actor). I enjoyed the music as well. Not a lot of variety but still great. 9/10
Characters: The characters in the anime are cool. The introductions were done well. Gon past isn't really explained as much I think it just summarized as a person growing up in an island and being one with nature. I think another negative here is that it introduces a lot of characters in the show. They show back history of characters that I just don't care about. There was history of one character and you don't even see the character. I went through episodes of shows that explain the character and it turns out I didn't care for it.  7.5/10
Overall with Bias: Hunter x Hunter is a great show. I love the main characters around it. The only complaint I had was for me it felt a little slow and they do a lot of explaining of characters that I did not care for personally. Has great action and emotions in this anime. I'd give this a 8/10.
Recommendation: I would recommend it if you love shonen type anime. I had a great time watching it, and would recommend this anime over the 1999 version for sure.",8

                Hunter x Hunter is an incredible anime. I would even go as far as to say that it’s one of the best of all time, and I truly mean that.
When I first heard about Hunter x Hunter, I assumed the worst about it. I had virtually no interest in watching it whatsoever – I’m more of a slice of life and romance kind of girl – and just thought it would be one of those run-of-the-mill adventure anime with flat characters and mindless action.
I was dead wrong!
Hunter x Hunter cultivates such a beautiful world with deep, complex characters – and it makes it so easy
                  for us to fall in love with them and root for their happiness and success.
The systems and rules in which their world operates are fascinating, nothing short of brilliant – yet aren’t too complicated, or difficult to follow.
Having the protagonist be a child adds an enjoyable, youthful lens to an otherwise overwhelmingly mature story. It adds levity, is a wonderful way of storytelling, and further emphasizes the harsh realities that he has to face and overcome.
The anime also features an incredible soundtrack. It keeps the same catchy, memorable, and familiar opening song the whole way through, and blesses your ears with an array of beautiful background music.
I’ll say this because a lot of people have mixed views. I believe that the Chimera Ant arc (otherwise known as the 5th season) is done exceptionally well. It’s very long – not a complaint or even a compliment, just a simple fact – but not drawn out or unnecessary. It’s paced well, and every episode is crucial to fully understanding the bigger picture. It introduces new characters, new ideas, and I just get so upset when I hear people say that they dropped the show because of the length, or just skipped the arc entirely! Please, don’t be turned off by how many episodes there are. I know it looks daunting, but you’ll want to binge all of them!
I should bring up the character, Hisoka, too – a popular antagonist who (there’s no real way to sugarcoat this) is pretty much a pedophile. He doesn’t actually do anything besides act creepy – but still, it can be uncomfortable and possibly triggering for some viewers.
Overall, Hunter x Hunter is an amazing emotional rollercoaster. Even if you only like the frilly feel-good stuff, or the really brainy feel-bad stuff, or if you just think Hunter x Hunter is “low brow” – I promise you, it’s worth giving it a chance. You won’t regret it. Hunter x Hunter is something special, and you deserve to see it.",10

                Wow now This is a good shonen (and a bit seinen at times)  after watching the slog that was FMA brotherhood, this was what I wanted.
This show isn't afraid go to to dark places, that don't just rely on gore and blood (like FMA)  but instead, with very complex villains, who have thoughts of their own, experiences of their own, that make you go ""oh, I can see how you've become like this"".
This anime consists of a couple of arcs, they might seem disjointed but that is the magic of hunter x hunter, you never know what you're going to get, and they
                  are all equally amazing (especially the chimera arc) I was blown away by some of the scenes and even cried as it becomes extremely emotional and the stakes are high.
This anime is strange, scary, adventurous, dark, fun. It is just a mix of different things that make it what it is, and that for me is a good show. I absolutely recommend it and it is one of the best experiences you can get.",9
"
                Without even finishing the show, I knew that I would be considering it as one of my favorites. The characters and their built connections are so incredible and touched my heart. The messages and struggles throughout are so impressively executed that I was always at a loss for words and entertained. Not to mention, the soundtrack may be one of the best I have heard thus far. The only reason it is not a 10 is because there were moments I personally found irrelevant or prolonged unnecessarily. Some of the buildups I questioned but ultimately I could appreciate because of the outcomes whereas others just
                  seemed like a lot of dialogue without a clear rhyme or reason. I could count on one hand the amount of times this happened so it’s not too obstructive to how great the show is as a whole. I definitely will be returning to rewatch and I bet I have a few tears left I’d be willing to shed for the characters that I love.",9

                Key phrases I associate with HxH: Strategy, friendship, adventure, family, complex power system, diversity, imagination, battle shounen.
History and Review Motivation
------------------------------------
Hunter x Hunter (2011) is the reboot of the manga's anime adaptation. It starts from the beginning rather than continuing where the 1999 version left off, however, the manga continues a little while after the events of the anime. Due to health reasons, the creator Togashi took a break from HxH but in May 2022, announced that he is picking up the story. I think the announcement may inspire fans to rewatch the series or inspire new people to start reading or watching HxH. So how
                  does the anime fair 10 years on and should you watch it?
Overall
---------
I do think HxH deserves 9 stars and is worth watching. It's great but I do have to disagree with all the 10-star reviews and even more strongly disagree with all the 1-star reviews. The art, story, characters, and music are all top-notch making it one of my favourites of its genre.
I initially thought that the art was childish and that I was in for a childish adventure. But no, this is a dark yet hopeful, clever, and epic story. HxH does not commit many cliches of most shounen and is mostly very enjoyable if you can endure some drawn-out parts. I wish all shounen writers to learn from this story.
Pros:
------
- Detail and Imagination of Universe:
You may have heard that this universe is very imaginative and detailed. It is. The diversity of the arcs makes the adventures so memorable and wonderful. I believe the power system of Nen is part of HxH success too. Its detail and flexibility make fights all the more exciting.
- Strategy:
Battles are won with brains not fists. For much of HxH, Gon and Killua have many adversaries that are stronger in raw power. To be victorious, the gang have to devise complex plans to best their opponents. Fights become ingenious and awesome because of this. Some of my highlight strategic fights are Gon v Hisoka (Heaven's arena), The bomber fight (Greed island), Isolating the Ant King and storming the palace (Chimera ant arc).
- Music:
""Departure"" is the opening theme throughout the show and is an A-tier opening. The endings slap too. The true musical gem however is the soundtrack. I love how Hisoka's fights are often accompanied by a signature almost Hispanic? inspired theme. Other scores draw on Mozart, Vivaldi and Holst (and others) to make some truly memorable scenes. My favourite scene in HxH is Uvogin's Requiem with the use of Lacrimosa by Mozart in the Yorknew City arc.
- Character Relationships:
I love the friendships in this show and appreciate how the writers don't exclude simple bonding and play between the kids: Gon and Killua. Another stand-out moment for me is the relationship between the Ant King Meruem and blind girl Komugi. Their story is like a Shakespearean tragedy. In my opinion, their relationship was frankly beautiful, and their demise was a moving conclusion to the Chimera ant arc. Despite a focus on the battle, this arc was really about love. Meruem's development and story is one of my favourite antagonist character developments of all time. Kite and Gon are also fascinating and worth mentioning since it drives some of Gon's later personal growth and development. Gon learns self-forgiveness and how to apologise to friends through this relationship.
- Main characters have strong motives:
Kurapika and Leorio. We meet them early on and are main characters. But they have their motives that don't necessarily align with Gon's. Hence, they disappear and reappear in the story when needed. I appreciate this. I don't like how in more basic shounens how we see the same main characters every episode and they always stick together because they are friends. No, in HxH Kurapika and Leorio pursue their dreams/motives which sometimes overlap with Gon's. In reality, friends have separate dreams and follow different paths. They will always be friends but don't need to spend every waking second with each other.
- Killua:
This kid is a pro all by himself. Another reason HxH is so popular. By far the coolest character.
- Not cringe:
HxH doesn't make the same mistakes as other shounen. There's no ""I'm gonna be the best!"", then the kid is already OP by just doing sit-ups. There's no ""This isn't even my final form!"", and battles don't get prolonged unnecessarily. The main character Gon goes through many lessons and the viewer learns about Nen along with him. Gon is by far the strongest character for most of the series. Only by the end he get really strong but at a great cost. Most villains in the show often have more complex motives beyond taking over the world - apart from one maybe. Just because HxH doesn't commit the sins of shounen cliche, doesn't make it the best shounen though.
Cons:
------
- Some arcs are painfully slow:
I'm talking about the last two arcs (chimaera and the election arc) were boring in parts. Chimaera ant arc is too long at 61 eps. I defo was not enjoying parts of it. Same with the last arc. Despite being much shorter, the election arc was drawn out because there were sooo many elections.
The fight between Netero and Meruem was hyped for so many episodes I can't even begin. They are two of the strongest characters in the show and almost each fight episode was separated by several other episodes to do with simultaneous events which was frustrating.
- Hunters?
I still find the Hunter concept weird. They are licensed elite members who track stuff down I guess. Could be food, people, or animals. It's not clear-cut and feels like an undecided and ambiguous concept from which to base an anime. I kind of brush aside this confusion.
- Pedos?
Hisoka and Palm. Also, Bizeff is weird.
- Lack of strong, super cool fights between the strongest:
I love awesome fights between the best. But for me, there are only a few really strong characters and I wish we saw more fights with them. Chrollo is a really cool and super strong leader of the Phantom troupe but he gets only one awesome fight with the Zoldyck family. Meruem vs Netero was not that good in my opinion. It was an okay fight. Yes, it was cool when Netero lost his arm yeah. But most of the fight was him just bitch slapping Meruem. Just slaps. 
Gon goes super saiyan one time and almost dies. I guess HxH is unfinished and there will be more epic fights to come. But for now, the absence of super-strong fights left me feeling dissatisfied.
- Other:
Greed island was kinda an annoying arc at the end. It was hyped by Gon and Killua that there must be a clue to find Ging. However, we were told at the begging in a message from Ging that there were no clues. The kids anyway proceed and win the game. Guess what, there were no clues! Goddam. Almost felt pointless, but at least it leads them to Kite so it's not all bad. 
Not switching opening every 12 episodes was also not my favourite. I prefer anime that switch openings like Black Clover - we got so many banging openings.",9
"
                Hunter x Hunter has six arcs. And each arcs are not that much related to others. So it is wrong to review the anime as whole. 
1
The first arc which is hunter exam arc is a great arc. It is one of the most intense exam ever to occur in anime world. Everything was highly detailed. The author showed tremendous intelligence in this arc. So this arc gets 10/10. 
2
The second arc is the heavens arena arc. This arc shows growth of the characters. They develop in their own way. Lots of things happen. But the the content doesn't loose it's grip in this arc
                  either. So this arc is obviously  10/10. 
SPOILERS ALERT 
3
The third arc is phantom troops arc. In this arc everything gets super serious. The boys fights the vicious criminals of the whole world. Kurapika was really cool in this arc. So many good characters. But this has a little bit of flaws. Likewise while phantom troops doesn't care about anyone's life except theirs. They kill just anyone with or without reasons. But despite Gon and Killua were both following them, they let them go just like that. How ? First you are showing them merciless and second when it comes to Gon and Killua they become super merciful and logical. Despite this little flaw. The arc was a masterpiece. So 10/10
4
Then comes the fourth arc which is Greed island arc. This arc isn't that much rich in content. There are lots of training. Lots of violence. But everything was in order. There weren't anything special about this arc. But it was good. So 8/10
5
The most potential arc is this anime is chimera ant arc. This arc had the most potential than any other thing in the whole world. This arc is really horrific. The author finally lost it while he was writing this arc. The author of this manga was in terrible health. So he ruined his manga in this arc. You know when you are in bad mood and everything bad happens that you do in the bad mood. This arc was a mess. There were too many logical flaws to to speak of. Just too many. Gon's character was literally destroyed in this arc. And the authors bad health got in his manga. If you are sharp you can notice those flaws. Unnecessary gore and cruelty makes this arc a bad taste in the brain.The quality dropped along with the authors health drastically. The show looses it's balance. So (-20)/10
6
The last arc is the election arc. This arc is good. It is a small arc. But the author was able to bring up those psychological conflicts between humans in a election with brilliance. so it is 9/10. 
I enjoyed the Hunter x Hunter quite a bit. But it put a disgusting test in the fifth arc. so I highly recommend you to not watch the fifth arc when you are in your right mind. watch the fifth arc later when you are in extremely bad mood or condition like the author. Then you will be able to enjoy that arc. 
Although my review is not absolute. Everything is relative in this world. From my point of view. And a normal common people's point of view. This review might be much acceptable.",4
"
                10/10 The greatest story told in anime...
But first, I think I should go over the criticisms, and throwing away the character designs for some villains(a panda wearing a tuxedo? wtf? a ant lady with huge boobs and wearing only underwear with a star on her bra? kinda stupid), the only criticism I can think of is the pacing in a certain 60 episode chimera ant arc.
Yeah in terms of criticisms thats all I can really say is bad.
People may argue that the greed island and zoldyck arcs are bad, but I just think they're subpar when compared to the rest of the series. I still
                  think that the greed island arc was really good and enjoyable, and so was the zoldyck arc.
Other than that, the 2011 anime Hunter x Hunter is virtually flawless. In terms of writing, the Chimera ant arc is the greatest story ever told, the characters are the best, and everything, from the fights to the relationship between gon and killua is magnificent.
No single story has ever—as a collective(there are still stories that have made me feel the individual verbs listed later)—made me laugh, cry, worry, get hype, except Hunter x Hunter.
It is truly the pinnacle, a brilliant masterpiece that should be regarded as a classic of storytelling in general.",10
"
                Well, this is hard one.
HxH is legendary, and for very good reasons, but it also commits some sins that can't be forgotten.
The series overall is good, but is hard to describe it as a whole because it changes a lot and with those changes also the quality vary.
The start is pretty simple and even friendly, the music is fun, there is some blood but there is a optimist and cartoonish tone overall. Then, it evolves into a more serious and tension focused tone, stays like that for an decent sized arc and then it goes back to be even more childish than in the start.
                  It can be very good and unique in its peaks but really bland and generic in its lows.
Fortunately in this case I can say that the good outweighs the bad pretty decently, the decent to excellent content occupy more than half the show duration and most of it has some pretty good storytelling, characters and story. Even the animation, soundtrack and direction can go up and intertwine with the story to create some incredible scenes that made the series as famous as it is.
It's from MadHouse, the technical aspect is really competent and leaves nothing to be desired.
Overall, even tho it can be generic, it also has some of the best stories that the Shonen has to offer. Plus, it also has one of it's best villains with a great feat of character growth that leaves almost every other villain with similar ideals in shame. It's worth watching to anyone that can tolerate the tropes of it's demographic and basically an obligatory view to Shonen fans.",8
"
                Story: 10
From start to finish I was enamoured with this show. I often hear from people, even fans, that they find the beginning of Hunter × Hunter boring, but I loved it. Even the episodes which seem like nothing is happening kept me engaged through great character building and development.
Every arc has a purpose, feels like it belongs in the story, and is well written. However, I don't want to say much more than this as I feel that experiencing things without ""clues"" is how one will most enjoy the show. However, I will say that Nen (the power system of the show) is also
                  insanely clever and well-designed. I shan't spoil it here, but know that you're in for a treat.
Art: 10
The world of Hunter × Hunter is gorgeous. There were multiple times throughout the series I distinctly remember audibly gasping at the scenery. Moreover, the animation doesn't weaken, and arguably gets better, as the show progresses. 
Sound: 10
One odd thing about the soundtrack is the fact that the OP sticks with the same song throughout the entire 148 episode run. While many people find this annoying, I personally do not. 
The EDs are all fantastic, my personal favourites being #3, #5, and #6 [#5 and #6 being from the same song, but different cuts]. The rest of the soundtrack is sublime.
""To Give a Marionette Life"" and ""The Silver-Haired Boy""/""The Silver-Haired Lullaby"" are a couple of my personal favourites tracks from the series.
Characters: 10
Throughout the entire series, I don't think there is a single badly written character. Not one. There are characters you love, characters you hate, characters you love to hate, characters you go from hating to loving, and even the reverse, but never a badly written one. 
The way that Togashi has written the characters makes you invested in each and every one of them. Even characters that you first feel are generic are well fleshed out and you quickly come to love with your heart. The way he writes his antagonists/villains is incredible. Each serves their purpose(s) perfectly, and they are some of the most adored characters of the show.
Enjoyment: 10
I enjoyed the entire series from start to finish. Togashi just needs to write more!
Overall: 10
I cannot stress enough that this show is a masterpiece. 
Profile Scoring:
Enjoyment - 5
Story - 2
Characters - 2
Emotional Resonance - 1
Total - 10 (Masterpiece)",10

                Wow just wow i mean i had heard that hunter hunter is one of the best anime out there but i didnt think it would be so good. The story is very good its on point the goal and everything our characters do are reasonable and dont do it just for friendship or other childish reason dont get me wrong 2 of the main characters are still childs 12 years old and still they act a lot childish in the whole series but its logical cause of age. The art is very pretty didnt touch me but it wasnt terrible the sound was also very
                  very good to be honest its been 2 months that i ended the series and still the op is playing in my head non stop all the endings are great the hit the theme of each arc and as of voice acting in japanese the voice actors have done a great job, the emotion is of the roof.Now i think that the strongest point of hxh is the characters and the development of those characters they all fit nice in their roles and they make you feel its natural to be this way.Over all its the anime out of 50+ that i have watched that me make me smile and at the same time 3 episodes later be so sad. I enjoyed every last second of it and honestly i thought if i could forget an anime and watch it over again i would definetily pick Hunter x Hunter",10
"
                This is a mandatory anime for any person after the 13 years, no less. But I recommend watching version 99 and then watching this one, the main 2011 problem is that this production starts this anime thinking of a more childish adaptation (for a younger audience) and then changes that, that creates a strange contrast that can create two bad decisions in the new audience: they leave the series but only follow by the advice of a great series, not their own decision or two, they do not digest this version expecting entertainment without so much suspense and violence.
I was disappointed myself after meeting top
                  to toe and cheering version 99, and looking up to episode 22, of course later watching the last episodes and it was a beautiful surprise, still not the charm of version 99, but when they put the production and direction in certain episodes and moments, this became a masterpiece, this is a carousel, I love it is a great anime but it could be even better, especially for that almost wrong start, one of the best animes of the decade and one of the best narratives i ever witness.",8
"
                Anime as a media has a lot to offer although battle shounens are the one that gets most of the limelight among any other genre of Anime. Despite this fact, after watching tons of good battle shounen we hardly get any show which can surprise us with something new, and here I'm not talking about a thrilling story because most of the battle shounen does a pretty good job with its peak fight and emotional moments. Here I'm especially talking about a story that surprises us with a different plot line which doesn't fit into the battle shounen mold. 
Hunter x Hunter offers one such
                  story which feels unique and new most of the time.
What did I like about Hunter x Hunter?
_Story [Minor Spoiler] - This show has 2 major arcs other than tournament and training arcs i.e. Yorknew City and Chimera Ant arc, both of which end without the fight we mostly anticipate for. Now that's not something that holds the story back but rather makes the plot much more real and believable and far different from any other similar show. The whole story in general is filled with abstract plot lines and character choices which enhances the story for the audience
_Characters - On the surface level characters do look shallow at first but with time the story does a brilliant job of exploring more of the character flaws which eventually makes the most of its character very human. 
_Power System - Hands down one of the best shounen power system. Nen is unique and diverse at the same time. One can almost write a whole book just explaining Nen. Thus most of the fights are exciting and unique despite being confusing at times
_The sense of Danger - People DIE in this series which is somewhat rare with similar shows. I think death is necessary for building tension among the audience and this show has a lot to offer. I mean a ton of people just die during a selection exam.
_Chimera Ant arc [MAJOR SPOILER] - The most compelling and unique arc for any battle shounen I ever came across. Chimera Ants as antagonists are by far one of the best villians in any entertainment media. Also the way this show explores the virtuousness of Chimera Ants and on the other hand, the evils of mankind was a mind-boggling experience to sit through. The whole character arc of Meruem says a lot about how Ants eventually developed some human values with time. On the other hand, despite being the strongest entity, the death of Meruem signifies how evil and wicked humans have become and no one stands a chance against them. This arc contains one of the saddest yet beautiful ending for any battle shounen arc
Where it could have been better? (Here I've mentioned a few aspects which I thought could have been improved)
_Art Style and Character Design - Now this is totally subjective but I find the character designs of this show kind of childish and annoying at times like few Chimera Ants looks like some low-budget mascot which doesn't justify their dark and evil character trait. Even the design of Royal guards and many main characters of this show looks average and flashy for no reason at all. Also, the art style of this show is pretty cartoonish and that's the main reason why I avoided it for so long time. This show has a dark theme and I think a dark gothic art style would have suited much better than the bright-colored cartoonish art.
_Pacing - Again not the worst but could have been improved. For example, the chimera ant arc takes around 40 episodes just to set up the big event which we knew gonna happen after like 20 something episodes which sometimes annoys you as a viewer like you already have some of the biggest threats humanity has ever faced walking around killing people but rather than focusing on them the show somewhat deviates from it and starts some new subplot which has very little to offer to the story or in terms of character development 
_Gon's Anger - This show does a great job with certain powerups the character goes through basically there is no ass pull which most of the battle shounen are famous for. Despite that one of the most highlighted scenes of this anime has our MC Gon transforming into something much more powerful just because of his uncontrollable anger which eventually destroys his body. Now the problem with this particular scene is that they never justified the reason behind his anger which eventually led the viewers to not properly connect with the character
Final Thoughts:
I consider this show better than any other modern battle shounen in terms of quality. The story, character motives, and their decision are much more real and human compared to any other show. Although I think the entertainment value could have been improved just by rectifying its pacing issues. 
Overall a must watch shounen which offers an engaging plot and some enjoyable characters",9

                I just recently rewatched this a few months ago on Tubi and finished it in less than a month. I needed to rewatch it because the original anime from 1999 is an all time fave and I feel like I didn't give this newer one much of a chance. I enjoyed it the first time but after this rewatch I think both are equally fantastic. The 1999 version gets just a slight edge mainly because it came out first and it was one of my first faves since I became an anime fan in 2000.
The story and characters are the best thing about this series.
                  The original has a really good filler arc with an extra bonus hunter exam but 2011 goes past the ovas so you see a lot more interesting characters. Gon is not my most favorite main character but together with Killua, Leorio and Kurapica they are the best group that you want to hang out with, especially Gon and Killua. Their friendship is the greatest in all of anime.
The art and sound are better in 2011. In the original I prefer the bg music over the orchestra music in 2011, but the ending themes are really epic. I just wish we didn't have to hear the same opening for all 100+ episodes.
My enjoyment for both are at a high level. I especially get most excited when I get close to seeing the badass Phantom Troupe. Theres no filler arc in 2011 but you do get 2 recaps which are in the first 26 episodes. The Chimara Ant arc drags a bit but does not take any points away from my enjoyment of this version.
Overall Hunter x Hunter 2011 is far supierior but the original will always be my fave, but just by a few nen threads.",10

                What can I say about Hunter x Hunter? I'd never really seen/heard much about this show. Maybe a few vague references here and there, and I'm honestly so shocked. This is easily one of the best shows that I have seen.
First impression from the first episodes, I got hardcore digimon vibes. Not gonna lie. It felt very lighthearted. However, don't let first impressions fool you. The series does an amazing job of exploring character personalities, pasts, and character development while still being plot driven. The pacing is wonderful, and the action scenes are entertaining without being drawn out or overwhelming (think DBZ). The series takes
                  an emotional and more gritty turn and progresses down that path for a while. The series doesn't exactly shy away from death, but not to the degree of things like attack on titan.
  The characters, character development, and character dynamic are amazing. Honestly, some of the best that I've seen. Real effort is put into the friendships and into the characters themselves. Especially the two main characters, who are both ADORABLE. The relationship between Gon and Killua is one of THE BEST little boy friendships I have seen depicted not just in anime, but in visual media in general. Real effort is made to show their relationship. However, they aren't just parts of a relationship are are still both very entertaining as individuals and not just as a duo. I live for their screen time.
   Overall, Hunter x Hunter is one of the BEST animes I've ever seen and is so well done. Definitely a MUST watch, for the casual anime fan and hardcore fan alike. Its a stellar piece that really speaks volumes and deserves more attention than it has received.  10/10",10

                What do I consider a masterpiece?
Well, it's really hard to tell because there aren't many examples of masterpieces in this beautiful universe of art. Only a few percentage of art creations can achieve such an utopic level of quality. So we can all agree that to be considered a masterpiece is to achieve perfection. And that is what Hunter x Hunter 2011 is. As hard as I tryied, I couldn't find a single part, a single episode or even a single scene in this anime that was anything but perfect. And I'll tell you why.
First of all: Story. We all learnt in school that to
                  make a good and coherent story, you need an introduction, development and conclusion. We just don't know how hard it is to do that. This anime is a beautiful journey from beggining to end. We understand the goal of each character and we cheer for them along the way. The character development is really well done and you can clearly notice the changes in characters' personalities (for better or for worse). Pacing is just right as it should be. You can notice the amount of attention and care that is dedicated in the way the story is delivered to the viewer. So I gave Story a 10.
Art and Animation: I congratulate Madhouse for putting so much love into the visuals of this piece. They proved that you don't need realism to draw something beautiful. The color palette used, character designs, ambientation, all is wholesome. You feel good looking at it. It's truly a work of art. Now animation is something Madhouse is quite known for. The movements are fluid and clear, making it easy to understand what's going on even in intense scenes with lots of movements. So I graded art and animation 10.
Sound: To immerge the viewer even more, a good sound creation is required. Sound effects match perfectly with the actions and movements shown, not being any louder or any lower than they should be. Voice acting is amazing. They picked the right voices for the right characters. You know it succeded when you forget there's an actor giving life to a character and in your mind it is the character's real voice. Soundtrack is one of the most valuable elements of this piece. As someone who worked creating orchestral arrangements, I appreciate so much the emotion invested in the entire soundtrack of this show. Spetacular, splendid. I happily grade Sound 10.
Enjoyment: If you have a good story and a good staff to bring it to life, nothing bad can come out of it. And that's exactly what happened to Hunter x Hunter 2011. It had everything it needed to become an exeptional anime, and it fortunately did. At the end of the day, if you enjoyed it, that's what counts. I had so much fun, what a ride. So I grade enjoyment 10.
Overall: Hunter x Hunter 2011 became my favourite anime ever, and I don't think anything will overcome it for quite a while. It achieved perfection. It's my only 10/10. I recommend it with every love in my heart.
In conclusion, this anime helped me become a better person because it made me think about the value of friendships, about being kind and sympathetic to everyone no matter who they are and about absorving what's best out of situations and happenings through the jorney of life.",10

                ""This is my first review, please forgive any mistakes"" Except i don't make mistakes and if i somehow inconceivably made a mistake i wouldn't need the forgiveness of some greasy goblin who hasn't seen this literal GIFT FROM GOD of a show.
This is literally the pinnacle of fiction. If you watch this show you will never get the same blissful experience you get from watching it from anything else. This show is peak fiction if you disagree I'm sorry but you are W R O N G. 
every arc of this show is better than anything you've ever seen before in your entire life. If
                  you dedicate a meager 2.36388888889
days of your life you can watch this whole show. So if you haven't seen it, sit the fuck down and watch it. NOW.
Some say ""hxh waaa waaa i don wanna watch it has a pedophile in it"" but in reality, it adds depth to the story, and just don't think about it too much, the show is still peak, and if you ignore how weird and gross Hisoka is sometimes somewhat cool.
Epic show 10/10 must watch if you do not watch all opinions are L and do not trust. 
thanks for reading >.<",10

                “You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that’s where you’ll find the things more important than what you want” – a quote from HxH. This review will contain minor spoilers. 
And that’s really what this show is all about, detours. The beauty of HxH is that you never really know what happens next. HxH makes a habit of tricking you into thinking something is definitely bound to happen, and we’re so certain of it because isn’t that how shounens or even shows in general work? Hell no. Not in the HxH world that is. The whole ride was exciting, thrilling, suspenseful and
                  leaves me wanting more, and as I type out this review attempting to fill the gaping hole the end of the show has left me with, I urge everyone to pick up this show right here and right now. 
Like many foolish foolish people, I brushed off HxH as some childish looking show, thinking it probably won’t be my cup of tea, because long-running shows were just too much of a commitment. But I am so thankful that I picked it up again a few months later, and it was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. The genres stated here on MAL doesn’t even begin to sum up what you should expect from HxH, because it encompasses so many different themes. Because each Arc is so distinctly different from the previous, nothing is ever repetitive, instead we viewers are treated with a bounty of fresh plot and characters (both new and old). 
On the topic of characters, this show has blessed me with my top two favourite characters of all time, the two protagonists, Gon and Killua. This entire show is centered on the two of them, their character development over time, their strengths their weaknesses, and most importantly their relationship. It brings a whole new light to the meaning of friendship (not in the cheesy way I assure you). Their presence made my entire HxH journey 10x more enjoyable. The thing with HxH is that we’re deceived from the poster and the first two arcs that the entire show will revolve around the 4 main characters, including Kurapika and Leorio, which unfortunately it didn’t, and the show just kinda ignores their existence for like a couple of arcs :/ But it makes up for it with AWESOME side characters. Every single character introduced in HxH has a distinct flavor to them, and even though they only last for a single arc for some and you never see them again, you quickly grow attached to them(even if they are the so called ‘bad guys’). Another phenomenal thing that HxH does is that it doesn’t draw a definite line between good and evil, everyone has a reason for acting a certain way and no character is outright angelic or demonic, not even Gon, the optimistic ball of sunshine that I assumed would stay as the show’s light that saves the day with his positivity, when in fact something very different happens. There is an actual portrayal of harsh reality, the circumstances that we may someday have to face, the sacrifices that we ought to make and the mistakes that we unintentionally make because to err is to be human. 
Another negative about HxH is that there are A LOT of still shots, panning shots and NARRATION. There are literally episodes where the narration takes up more than half of the episodes duration. And there are arcs where the pace of the show is reduced to a slow torturous craw. (But that’s what the fast forward button is for right?) But all is great because the show saves up budget from those episodes to animate amazingly spectacular fight sequences that will stun your very eyes. Ever fight scene in HxH is extremely entertaining, because the whole concept of Nen, which is the very aura humans have and how it is tapped  on to give us “powers”, is both unique and holds so much potential. Every character has their individual technique and this gives rise to extremely interesting and fascinating action scenes that reflect their personality and their fighting style, altering what some may see as boring repetitive brawls into plot and character development elements embedded within each brutal exchange. The outcome of fights are always unpredictable, because the thing with Nen is that pure strength is not definite enough to determine who would win in a fight, but rather the strategies that are adopted and the nature of the characters’ powers influence the direction the fight heads towards. So even the weakest fighter, if possesses a technique that can single out a flaw in an extremely powerful opponent, can also come out victorious. 
HxH has been praised beyond the roofs and I was fully aware of that before starting out the show wanting to see whether it really is as good as people claim it to be and it truly has defied all my expectations. It made me laugh, it made me cry (a lot), it made me feel and learn many things that I didn’t know was possible through 2D animation and fictional characters. HxH really is the masterpiece that I believe everyone can enjoy as long as you’re able to ignore some of its minor flaws. I praise the gods for the existence of Yoshihiro Togash (HxH’s mangaka) and I pray that his back recovers completely so he can finally complete the manga and not go on hiatus ever again. Thanks for reading this review :)",10

                ""Hunter x Hunter 2011"" is without a doubt one of, if not the greatest shounen Anime of all time. Togashi manages to create brilliant and memorable characters that fit perfectly in a unique and intricate story. Studio Madhouse manages to take Togashi’s efforts and transform them into a brilliant anime adaptation that is true to the magnificent source material. In this review I will be breaking down the elements that make ""Hunter x Hunter"" deservedly as critically acclaimed as it is.
Story
10/10
""Hunter x Hunter"" follows the story of Gon, a 12 year old boy who wants to become a Hunter and find his dad who is
                  a hunter, in “Hunter x Hunter” hunters are individuals who dedicate their lives to specific fields and missions for example, a gourmet hunter hunts for unique types of food while a ruin hunter hunts for ancient ruins and historic sites that are yet to be discovered. Hunters are extremely well respected by the society that surrounds them. Some of the top ranking Hunters are said to have the same power as a president. “Enjoy the littler detours to the fullest because that is where you will find the things most important than what you are looking for” this quote is taken from a character from ""Hunter x Hunter"" (the character shall remain unnamed in order to avoid spoilers). This quote perfectly sums up the approach Togashi has towards his story. The main plot point of finding the father is almost always overshadowed by several sub-plots. Togashi manages to implement a lot of interesting characters and thrilling events into these subplots which always keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. It’s actually more fitting to say that in some arcs the sub-plots transform into the main plot and the main plot is swept aside till the sub-plot ends .This causes ""Hunter x Hunter"" to feel like a new series at the begging of every arc, which makes it non-repetitive and always entertaining to watch. Another thing that keeps this story entertaining is the change of tone that occurs in every Arc. Some arcs such as the first and third arc can be very adventurous and have a mostly positive atmosphere. Other Arcs such as the fourth and sixth Arc can be extremely violent, dark and depressing. This shift in tone is essential for a series that is 148 episodes long. 
Characters
10/10
Togashi can easily change the cast of an entire arc when starting a new one. The characters present in an arc are always almost 100% different from the character of the preceding arc. The only characters that appear in every arc are the two leads, Gon and Killua. Togashi manages to write every single character in a very unique way, he would often give appealing character designs and backstories to characters who appear for a short amount of time (Usually  they’re instantly killed off). Togashi’s strongest point in the whole series is his ability to write villains. All the Antagonists in Hunter x Hunter (with the exception of the bombers) have several layers to their personalities. The villains aren’t just cool characters that are given any lame reason to fight the protagonists. Instead the antagonists are well-developed characters whose interest’s conflict with the interests of the main protagonists, this makes the protagonist’s and antagonist’s battles have more value and intrigue added to them in addition to making the plot feel smooth and UN-forced. Another great thing Togashi does is making all the present character have a significant influence over the narrative. In most Shounen series there will be a point in the story where a lot of characters are just standing there in the background looking like a bunch of completely useless cheerleaders while the main character pummels the bad guys. That's not the case with ""Hunter x Hunter"". If Togashi takes the time to include a character in the current-narrative than he will make sure that the character plays a significant part and that  his/her motives are well aligned with what is going on in the story. 
Sound and Animation
8/10
For a series that is 148 episodes the animation of “Hunter x Hunter (2011)” is as good as it get. The animation has never been bad, it is average at worst. In the regular moments that don’t require much attention the animation is “average”. In episodes where something important happens the animation quality jumps up a notch to “really good”. In the few unforgettable moments the animation jumps to “Excellent” all of the sudden (Especially towards the second half of the Chimera Ant Arc). Basically the animation is always consistent and the animators save their best effort for the right moments. The soundtrack is very catchy and a few tracks are absolutely brilliant (Elegy of the Dynasty and Riot, and The Last Mission are my favorites). The problem is that there aren’t enough tracks in the soundtrack several themes are played over and over again throughout the course of the series which can sometimes bore the viewer’s ear (especially if you are re-watching ""Hunter x Hunter""). However, the soundtrack does become a lot more diverse in the sixth arc as several new themes are introduced. The brilliance of the soundtrack more than makes up for its repetitiveness.
Overall
10/10
""Hunter x Hunter"" is definitely a masterpiece. Not because it lacks any significant flaws but because it is an extremely ambitious series that proves that a Shounen can have masterful storytelling with a sophisticated plot and extremely well-developed characters. Classy, consistent and filled with quality, ""Hunter x Hunter"" is definitely worth the couple dozen hours that you will spend if you chose to watch this anime.",10

                You may be watching this series in the first few episodes and be wondering why people who recommend the series do so.  To you, I say press on, for great things await you if you do.  I enjoyed it so much, I took off work a few days to binge this series once I got into it, and I don't usually do that.  
I enjoyed the character growth of this series a lot.  Once Nen abilities start coming into play, the story really takes off, and viewers are treated to some interesting powered foes and friends alike.  I like how
                  the characters analyze and work through situations, it gets pretty creative!  The art is fine, pretty standard, but still fun.
The heartbreak of this series is that it ended because there was no more source material at the time, as the author has some medical issues that stopped him writing for a time.  The manga has continued past the anime, but not really far.  My hope is that the anime is eventually continued once the source material is plentiful, as this is one of my favorites.",10

                ""Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word ""unknown"" holds magic.
And some incredible people are drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!"" 
Watching this anime actually felt like going on a journey. From start to finish, it was incredible. 
The 148 episodes of Hunter x Hunter are currently split into seven arcs (if you include the Zoldyck Family arc), each of which are in very different settings, still following the main plot. One criticism I have relating to the story is that the chimera ant arc was quite long and could be boring at times, however many people have argued that its
                  length was necessary. 
The problems that the characters were faced with and the fight sequences were all quite complex. I loved being made to think hard in difficult situations and then being shown a possibility I would have never considered. 
The characters' backstories and personalities were all very unique, and it was interesting to watch them develop as they gained new experiences. Gon, the main protagonist and who the story begins with, is a pure-hearted, kind and resilient young boy, who is determined to find his father and has a thirst for adventure. Killua, on the other hand, is cold and mysterious, with a past shrouded in darkness. Initially, he is very confident about his own abilities, even going as far as questioning Gon's capability during the Hunter Exam. Despite being polar opposites, the two become best friends and Gon changes Killua's life completely. Kurapika, a more complex character, is intelligent, disciplined, determined to reach his goal and eventually distances himself from the others. His past, filled with hatred, is what drives him. I would have liked to have seen more about Kurapika, espescially towards the end of the series, however I understand that this is due to the manga not being complete. Leorio strives to do his best, but seems to never be able to do as well as the others. Initially, he is portrayed as selfish, caring a great deal about material wealth, but the reason for this is later revealed. 
In terms of characters, I have one criticism: was it really necessary for Hisoka to be so disgusting? I understand that it was something to do with power and that he helped Gon get stronger blah blah, but it was so gross and unnecessary.
The soundtrack was perfect. :) I still listen to the OST sometimes. Each scene had music that reflected the emotion I felt watching it perfectly. Some people have said that the songs were overused, but that never bothered me in the slightest. 
I loved how much emotion the voice actors had (note - I watched the Japanese version). Each character had a voice that fitted their personality perfectly.
The animation and colours were stunning and reflected the feeling of each scene perfectly, especially during fight sequences and particularly emotional moments.
I started watching Hunter x Hunter in October 2020, which was a very bad time for me. This series gave me something happy (mostly) to look forward to every day. No matter what I watch in the future, Hunter x Hunter will always be one of my favourite animes. It's unforgettable and a must-watch for absolutely everyone. Thankyou Togashi for making this masterpiece. :D",9
"
                Overall:
I tried really hard to like Hunter x Hunter. It certainly had some great moments, it's beautifully drawn and has amazing soundtrack and the first few arcs are really great, but the anime got at least as many flaws and the story is getting really bad in the later arcs. Overall, I think this anime is overrated.
Story: 5
The anime has a pretty slow start, which makes it hard for watchers to decide whether or not it will be worth watching ~150 episodes. The development during the first 2-3 arcs is pretty amazing and I totally liked the whole fighting and training part of the anime.
                  However, the main arcs of the series, namely greed island and chimera ant arcs are really boring compared to the ones before.
Characters: 7
It has some really cool characters, like Killua (his fighting style, family, backstory etc.), Meruem and Hisoka, but most of them, including Gon, are missing a lot of personality and complexity. 
Art and Animation: 8
The graphics and animation are over the average. Still, after watching Anime like Fate Zero / Stay night, I cannot give 10 points.
Enjoyment: 6
It has been a ride on a sine curve. The anime had a weak start, the last 2-3 arcs were not that interesting, and a great development in between.",6
"
                1- The anime is more than great, I enjoyed the whole arc, all the arc and its atmosphere.. the characters.. the drawing is good, I lived a large part of it since I was a child, and now I watched it well.
2- There are great symbols, for example when Gon took revenge on Beto and put his or her head on him.
3- The diversity of the characters' traits and temperament was at the top of the splendor.
4- The characters' handling of hardships and problems was outstanding.
5- I do not think that the work will be hated by many, but some may see that it is
                  stretching events.",10

                Hunter x Hunter is one of my all-time favorite series. I really enjoy the manga very much. I also enjoyed the 1999 series a lot, but I'm going to try my best not to refer back to that and stick to this version when doing my review. It took me a while, but I finally got through the 2011 series. It's just...so-so to me. I do prefer the 1999 series over it based on the arcs that each series covered and will do my best not to compare too much. I'll give my opinion on the Chimera Ant arc and Chairman arc separately since the
                  1999 version never got to that point.
In this world, you have people called Hunters who can do a lot of different things. You could be a person who travel the earth to discover new species or hunt for treasure, or go after criminals like a Bounty Hunter. Becoming a Hunter is an honor and a difficult task to manage as you have to pass an exam (which is different every year), but when you do, you get many perks and kickbacks since there are so few of them. The pass rate for the exam is usually small and you could even be killed for participating in it.
The story starts off with a naive, slightly selfish, 12-year-old boy named Gon. He lives with his grandmother and cousin, Mito, who took care of him after his father abandoned him when he was a baby, on a very small island. We never find out who his mother was and when he had the chance, he chose not to because he viewed his cousin Mito as his mother. His father is a Hunter, so he wants to take the exam in hopes of finding his father. He leaves on his journey and meets up with the characters of 18-year-old Leorio and 16-year-old Kurapika. Leorio wants to become a Hunter for the fame and fortune, but you find out that his shallow reason was just a cover. His reason is actually more admirable.  Kurapika wants to become a Blacklist Hunter to find a crime group (guess you could call them that) that slaughtered his clan while he was away. He wants to hunt the group's members down and retrieve what was stolen from his clan members.  The last one to join the group is a 12-year-old boy named Killua. He's from a famous family known for assassinating people. He's also really rich because of the family business. He doesn't have much interest in it and just wants to live more freely to do what he wants. Killua only joined the Hunter exam just for the heck of it and just thought it'd be fun.  Gon and Killua become good friends.
The story for Hunter x Hunter is pretty simple, getting down to it. It's easy to follow and the world building of the series is pretty good...but imo, the 2011 series somewhat fails here compared to the 1999 series. My main issue with the 2011 series is that the pacing is too fast. I couldn't get attached to the characters too well. The pacing for the original was slower and maybe that's just me, but I tend to lean more towards that. We could see more of the world based on that because we spent more time in those areas. I do know that the 1999 version took liberties, but it did help with that world building and character development. 
The art for this series is...okay? For me, personally, it's just too bright and colorful and cheerful. Hunter x Hunter has a dark tone story wise and seems the art should reflect this. It was too flashy and such for me, given how much death is in this series. The 1999 series, however, I feel did better with this. The colors reflected the tone of the show. Even the way the lighting and direction when comparing some scenes seemed to work better for the 1999 series compared to this.  The Gon vs Hanzo fight is a good example of this, as the art showed that hours had gone by (like in the manga) where as for this series, it was that same lighting the entire time.  Or like the Yorkshin arc when Kurapika was walking back from the auction in such a state and that mafia leader guy was arguing with him, angry at Kurapika for punching him in the face earlier...the lighting shining on and off his face as he was slowly walking was perfect and more intimidating...not so much, imo, for the 2011 version. 
The music for the show was okay to me. I suppose I'm indifferent to it, but I will admit that I didn't care for the intro themes and outro themes too much. Felt generic to me.
The characters are all good in some way, but I still feel that because of that fast pacing, it was difficult to fully care about them or get to know them.
The Chimera Ant arc and the Chairman arc are the only arcs that the 1999 series did not cover as the manga was in a hiatus when it got to that part and neither were completed yet. This arc was good if you like being emotionally drained. Lots of deaths for this one. I feel that they did a halfway decent job, the art was okay for it too even if it was too bright for me at times and I am more of a fan of hand-drawn animation so I suppose that's just my bias showing and why I prefer the 1999 series' art. It adapted the stuff from the manga well here and the feeling I had when reading parts of this arc was fully conveyed in the show...especially Gon's anger at the character Pitou. It was like Gon's aura was oozing out of my screen and it was making me uncomfortable. lol  
The Chairman arc was about the same as the manga too. Not much goes on for it, but even in the manga I felt that this dragged on for far too long. 
Something that did bother me a lot these arcs was the narrator. It really took you out of the action and it was so darn unnecessary! I mean the Chimera Ant arc is already convoluted and nuts, but we didn't need a narrator.  There are some parts where a narrator is necessary as that's how it was in the manga sometimes, like explaining the story of the guy who became a drug or weapons lord (whatever) in that area where the Chimera Ants were. His character had to be explained to the audience so a sequence and a narrator made sense for that. The narrator summing up the whole Gon and Palm situation made sense to narrate for. Everything else, no. Not during battles and this was the most frustrating part to me. It's almost like hand-holding. It's a visual medium, we can *see* what's happening. If they want to talk about how a characters is feeling, then they should be able to show that through their actions, dialogue, inner monologue, or facial expressions. Really brought it down for me.
Not sure if this review will be helpful, but overall the 2011 series is just mediocre for me. It is good in some ways, like being able to adapt the Chimera Ant arc, but that just makes me wish that we could've gotten this in the 1999 style with the studio from back then with all the hand-drawn backgrounds and animation. Also curious of what the music would've been like.
If one doesn't mind slower paced series, I'd recommend watching the 1999 version and then picking up the 2011 version for the Greed Island arc and up or either start from the Chimera Ant arc. The 1999 series ended in the Yorkshin arc and continued in an OVA. The art wasn't all that great for either of the OVAs. Greed Island's two OVAs was really noticeable. So if you are big on art, I'd skip those and just watch the 2011 adaptation.",6
"
                I'll start off with this. I really like the world of HxH and the nen power ups but this show does have some flaws. I really don't like Gon. Like he has no personality and he cares more about his deadbeat dad then he does about his friends. I would much rather have a Kurapika or Killua spin off than this because they have more interesting motives and backstories. Leorio is a fantastic character and probably my second favourite but he wouldn't be a good mc. Also, the chimera arc was extremely long and it felt like the first half had no purpose. I liked
                  the ending with Mereuem and the Shogi girl so it wasn't all bad. In conclusion, if there was a spinoff on Killua, Kurapika or Hisoka I would much rather watch that. Fuck Gon",8
"
                Presentation/Animation: 7/10. Despite a 148 episode length, a surprising amount of care can clearly be seen throughout the various arcs to give a competent and different feel on some of the technical aspects. The generally upbeat and atmospheric music makes it easy to stay attentive and while the artwork isn't the strongest it utilizes hype very well to keep exposition-filled episodes interesting and un-repulsive. Something noteworthy are the openings, the fifth especially, being absolutely fantastic alongside every ED (minus the first and fourth) keeping every episode ending on a good note. While the effects work were generally forgettable for me (especially the Nen effects -
                  below Dragon Ball tier there!), during the ""Ant Arc"" there are awesome moments where emotion is actually shown through the Nen effects combined with effective voice acting and appropriate coloring. I'm not even entirely sure why I'm surprised at the overall quality, seeing as ""bad shounen anime"" is really only from super long adaptations burning out the staff over several years or decades. 
Characters/Plot: 8/10. The anime adapts 7 arcs, catching up completely to the manga. Each of them are good in their own ways with the exception of one arc. Out of everything, there's only one arc I would label as a black sheep: the Yorkshin Arc. The characters, abilities, fight scenes, and plotline here totally bomb the arc into blunt stupidity and almost pretentiousness with how the community reacts to it. Other than that, aspects of Chimera Ant, Eating contest Arc, Gon's dad, and Nen itself detract somewhat from an otherwise very competent overall story. I'm not very happy about many of the characters in Chimera Ant, but the fantastic Palace Invasion sub-arc makes this almost irrelevant in retrospect. Greed Island is probably the best adapted arc. The world building is really weird and weak, how does nobody supposedly know about Nen if competitions with it are held constantly? Something unfortunate about the first 60 episodes is that they are totally outclassed by the 1999 adaptation, since this version decided to cut out what the manga author story-boarded into the 1999 version. This was a poor choice as it revealed how the mangaka correctly added in things that made the early arcs even better. And no, I'm not just saying that because ""it's older."" It legitimately outclasses the first 60 on basically every level, and yes, including animation and music. On a positive note I'm pleased to say that 2011 adapts Greed Island, which is far superior to the somewhat shoddy 2003 version.",8

-- The review contains spoilers--
So in “One Piece” we got dudes who wanna become pirates right? In “Naruto” we got dudes who want to become respected ninjas. Cool world settings, they’re simple but effective descriptions that can help drive a story forward.
In “Hunter X Hunter’ we got dudes who want to be able to do whatever the fuck they please. That’s about as accurate as it gets with this world setting. A “Hunter” as described in the beginning of this anime as someone who has a license that grants him complete freedom to travel where he pleases, and kill whoever he pleases. People become hunters
                  because they want to pursue something, for example exotic monsters or jewellery.  Now the anime becomes bat-shit crazy when the obstacles that are portrayed in this fictional universe are just straight up unforgiving. 
The fictional universe here is just extremely dangerous and every pursuit by a hunter always involves death and suffering.
Want a rare trading card? Sorry, you’re going to have to win a game of dodge ball against a team of steroid-abusing super-humans who can kill you in-game by the way.
Want to stamp on an ant? Sorry, you’re going to have to use a special nuclear missile that poisons those who manage to survive the explosion. Either that or you have to beat the ant in a game of three-dimensional chess.
Note: These are actual events in the anime and haven’t been over-exaggerated in any way.
The story, at-least as long as the anime aired centred around a 10 year old boy looking for his father, who in the process ends up becoming a hunter, creating beef with a family of assassins, clearing a video game that kills you in real-life if you die in game and also killing an ant cat-girl. It doesn’t get better than this folks.
On a more serious note, this anime is a fighting anime that is basically a lesson to every other fighting anime in existence on how to do it right. The super-natural powers and martial art technique shown in the anime immerse you in fights that are over-whelming yet not over-exaggerated. The anime achieves this by simply explaining the world it’s set in with a degree of rationality a scientist would describe the world we live in with. Nothing feels unreal if you can explain it. This also leads to a dark atmosphere being set out throughout the anime accompanied by parts that make you feel the anime is just another easy-going show.
The heavy technical side of the anime unfortunately ends up reducing the pacing significantly, and also killing the humanity in the plot. But it really is compensated by how good everything else is.",10

                i think this is my favorite anime of all time. This show really has it all: great plot, likable and well written characters, consequences, amazing fights and most importantly, hot people. 
The plot flows almost perfectly throughout the show and although a lot occurs, the storyline barely ever strays from the principal goal of the main character, Gon.
I learned a shit ton of life lessons from watching this show including stuff about myself, friendship, loss, and how to treat people, especially during the chimera ant arc, which is unarguably the greatest arc in the show. i understand if you didn't like it or have a
                  different favorite arc, but you can't deny that it is so beautifully written. don't even get me started on Meruem.
I can't even describe how this show made me feel while i was watching it. i started this during a completely mediocre time in my life and it was like an amazing, happy, comfortable journey that turned almost barren when i got to the last episode. It fulfilled my every expectation leaving me feeling almost empty bro. I would cut off all my limbs and shave all my hair off my body looking like the damn instagram automatic profile picture just to see this show for the first time again. 
i don't know what else to add except for the FACT that every single song in this show is absolute gas. don't forget to daichi wo fumishimete today everyone.
u need to watch this show to experience life. that is all.",10

                Before I watched Hunter X Hunter, i highly underestimated it. It looks like a regular anime that's simple and quite frankly boring, however it is not. Hunter X Hunter is one of my favorite anime's to date and I've re-watched it hundreds and thousands of times. If you are hesitating to watch this anime because of bad reviews, length, or a simple ""I'm not sure.."" , stop hesitating!
The characters all stand out and are unforgettable. If you take the time to invest in the story and characters, you'll see how much these characters expand and improve upon themselves. It's mesmerizing when you watch these stubborn
                  kids force themselves to work harder to a common goal, especially for their friends.
The story is UNIQUE. There's happy moments that make you smile, sad moments that force tears out of your eyes, hardcore action that makes your heart pound, and friendship that makes you envious.
I really enjoyed Hunter X Hunter and I wish there would have been more episodes. Had the anime continued, I would have religiously watched every episode. ( I do that now, anyways. )",10

                masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! better than Naruto and One piece for sure ! 
Highly recommend to everyone! 
My fav characters are Gon and Hisoka ! 
the plot is amazing ! As for pacing and development, they are excellent. For the most part, HxH is very well paced. The series does a fantastic job at keeping its viewers engaged
Sometimes it's almost hard to take your mind off the insane battles long enough to get and laugh at the occasional zingers. The show almost never fails to entertain us
Seriously give this a go, I have no idea why it's not as popular as the likes of Naruto and One Piece it's way more interesting than both in my opinion.",10

                This show was recommended to me by my friend. Having heard many great things about it I decided to give it a shot.
Story (8/10):
While many will say that the story is much more than a generic shounen, I don't agree. The story feels and runs just as a normal shounen would. Does that make the story any less enjoyable? The answer is no.
The story can feel slow at times, especially during the Chimera Ant arc in the end. Just for the comparison the rest of the arcs were around 15 - 20 episodes, and this one lasted 60 episodes. 
Generally the story is enjoyable and
                  well written. While there are some ""weaker"" parts, the quality is almost consistent during the show.
Art (10/10):
Animation quality is superb. The animators weren't lazy and the animation is fluid. Character design is really great and faithful to the manga. I saw some of the episodes from the 1999 adaption, and the animation certainly improved. 
Sound (9/10):
The thing I found interesting is that there is only one opening song throughout the show. At first it felt like it's nothing special, but in the end I really started liking it.
As for the background soundtrack, it really added to the experience. The music amplifies every scene, from ones that are just goofy all the way to the dramatic ones. 
Voice actors did an awesome job. The voice actors were suited for their characters.
Characters (6/10):
Ah, the characters. The character development is the main reason this show got 8 from me. There is almost no canon background story. The show lasted for 148 episodes, and I feel like that was enough time for them to let us learn more about their past. Because of this, the character actions sometimes look illogical and rushed.
The thing that also bugged me, but not as much as development,  is that there were 4 main characters, but some of them got almost no screen time in the later show. I feel like they shouldn't have introduced as many characters if they weren't intending to develop them in the later episodes.
Enjoyment (8/10):
As I said earlier the show is really enjoyable. It can get slow at the times during parts you might not necessarily like, but it is worth getting through them.
Overall (8/10):
In spite of many outstanding reviews, I wouldn't say this was one of the best animes out there. Nevertheless, the good parts of this show outweigh the flawed ones. In general, I would recommend this anime to the people who like shounen and action packed animes.",8
"
                Hunter x Hunter is my favorite anime and also the best anime ever.(for anime with more than 100 episodes) Let me just say that, the start of this anime is very slow and you may even drop it after 5-6 episodes. So here you have to be a bit patient. After 9th or 10th episode it gets a bit interesting but the show really starts at Havens Arena. ( ep. 27) And don't get me wrong it isn't that its plain boring till that part, only the starting few episodes are slow, other than that its pacing is still better than early stages of 
                  Naruto / Dragon Ball Z / Bleach/ etc. And when I say that its the best 100+ ep. anime out there I am not exaggerating or over hyping the show, it really is. And you will agree with me after the Chimera Ant Arc.
The show follows our protagonist Gon  who is searching for his father who abandoned him when he was a child in order to become a Hunter( in this universe its like an Adventurer ). And he follows the footsteps of his father and gives the hunter exam and there he meets the other important characters in the series. And I don't want to say more about the story. I highly recommend this show. Watch it and you will not regret the decision.  This is one of the must watch anime. Be sure to check it out. And for more good recommendations follow my page.",10
"
                I don't usually post reviews. Yet, here I am, currently writing a review for a show that I finished two weeks ago. Since finishing Hunter x Hunter, this show has impacted me so much that it basically lives in my head rent-free. That in itself shows how beautiful and captivating this anime is. 
Before, I had pushed off watching Hunter x Hunter for certain reasons. A major one had to be the number of episodes it had. As someone who was used to the typical 15-20 episode anime, an anime having a total of 148 episodes worried me. What if it got boring? What if
                  it drags out so much that I won't be able to finish it? 
But, fear not, because HxH did nothing of the short. Encompassed with beautiful characters, an amazing soundtrack, and an intriguing plot coupled with a unique power system, HxH keeps you engaged with every episode. I think that's hard to achieve, and especially hard to maintain throughout a number of episodes. You'll definitely learn a lot from this show--about life, about humanity, about friendship and love.
I believe what makes HxH stand out from all the rest is definitely the dynamics and importance of each character. No character is truly in this story ""just because."" Each of them has their own personality and their own role to play in the story. In addition, the plot is marvelous. Each arc has its own lesson and story that is coupled with amazing action sequences. Also, the soundtrack is the most beautiful one I've heard. The openings, endings, even the instrumentals that play throughout the episode--they fit exactly with the moment. 
Although some may say that the pacing during Season 5 was a bit much, I disagree with this statement completely. Tell me, would you prefer more episodes focusing on the intricate action and fight sequences in this show, or would you prefer all the glory to be condensed into a measly few episodes? The pacing in this show is phenomenal. There's a reason why Season 5 was ""dragged on""--to build up suspense, to make the audience savor every moment in the best way they could.
Overall, this show was such a pleasant surprise to watch and enjoy. I truly hope the best for Togashi's health so that we can see a new season to this show in the near future.",10
"
                one of my all time favorite anime!!  it has a really interesting plot and I love everything about it. my only complaint is that the anime has been on a hiatus for a very long time and i'm not sure when we'll get a new season.  
the characters are one of my favorite parts of this anime. the way they act to each other is truly unique in this anime. their nen powers are also very detailed and that's what makes them so memorable. also, the way the power system works (nen) is very inclusive and makes so many great characters out of
                  them.",10

                Spoiler free review! (Some explanation, but most is pretty vague).
Hunter x Hunter is one of those animes that is unanimously praised in the anime community. Going into the show, I chose to overlook it’s acclaim, and instead, try to form my own opinion on the show. Often, I find that going into an anime with too high of expectations barely ever turns out well, and that is something I think new Hunter x Hunter watchers should keep in mind. Admittedly, I was nervous to commit to finishing such a long show. I’m an avid 12 episode anime watcher, so this 148 episode long show was
                  quite different from my usual taste.
Story - 6/10
In most shounen anime I have seen, the premise and story of the show usually trumps all other aspects- Hunter x Hunter is definitely an outlier. The audience is told that in this world, there are these uniquely talented individuals called “Hunters”. What do these hunters do? Well, it’s really not specified. The lack of explanation and ambiguity of the purpose of Hunters in the world persists throughout the entire show. Possibly, this is done so the plot has freedom, and isn’t tied down to strict “rules” of what the hunter can and cannot do. Yet, it still frustrates me that after watching the entire show, I can’t conjure a clear answer to what hunters are. 
From arc to arc, the quality of story ranges. There’s certain parts of the show, where I feel it doesn’t want you to think deeply about what’s going on, because if you do, you’ll notice all the plot holes. I felt this was most apparent in the greed island arc, heavens arena arc, and Zoldyck family arc. In my opinion, the green island arc was probably the worst written in the show. Seen as a lighthearted journey, it doesn’t excuse it from having one the most ridiculous plot twists, and overall, the story was all over the place and very unsatisfying by the end. Other than meeting Bisky, not much else was accomplished during this expedition. As for the hunter exam arc it is very mediocre to me, a good introduction nonetheless, but nothing to rave about. As for the hunter exam arc it is very mediocre to me, a good introduction nonetheless, but nothing to rave about.
However, other parts are meticulously crafted, with clear purpose, and satisfying endings. This is where the Yorknew City arc, chimera ant arc, and election arc belong. The Yorknew City arc is by far the best part of the show. An interesting setting, presence of all of the “main characters” (Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio), powerful enemies, and Kurapika’s intention to avenge his clan. This arc truly has everything going for it. If the entirety of Hunter x Hunter was the same quality as the Yorknew City arc, it would be a 10/10 for me. 
Also, I would have preferred if the transition between arcs didn't feel so choppy. I enjoy when the story flows seamlessly, but there were a few moments that just felt very unnatural in how quickly the focus of the story changed. I really love when one can tell a story has been planned from beginning to end, and that is evidently not the case for this anime. 
Sound - 9/10
Not much to say other than that the Hunter x Hunter soundtrack is amazing. The different themes for each character makes you excited every time you hear that “one song”. As the tone of the episode shifts, the music will always represent that. My only complaint is sometimes I feel the songs can be misused every once in a while. Sometimes, suspense is best built in silence, and not every relatively sad moment needs a cheesy song, indicating that you should cry now.   Despite my pickiness, the choice in music definitely enhances the audience's experience and I think it’s neat that I now have an attachment to each song in the soundtrack.
Art - 8/10
Hunter x Hunter’s art style is definitely pleasing to look at. The character’s appearances and personalities tie into one another seamlessly, and the choice of fashion, especially in characters like Hisoka and Illumi, is very impressive. This is significant as the show has a huge character list, yet all the character’s designs are so different from one another. For the backgrounds, the settings are (mostly) engaging, and color choices are realistic. The repetition of the same, kinda bland colour palettes can get boring, but on the bright side, it gives the audience a feeling of familiarity, and like the Hunter x Hunter world is similar to our own. 
Characters - 8/10
What I really think Hunter x Hunter has going for it is it’s characters. Truly, I believe its outstanding amount of hype mainly stems from the amount of developed characters this show has to offer. Firstly, I would like to address the misconception that I think everyone has while watching this show. Yes, Kurapika and Leorio are initially perceived to be main characters, but my god, do not think that, you will be sorely disappointed. Gon and Killua, are in my opinion, the only main characters, Gon being the main protagonist. When it comes to their characters I think anyone with a heart can appreciate their friendship, however, I feel the term “better together” definitely pertains to them. 
Gon, is surprisingly decent for a stereotypical protagonist. Though he fits pretty much all the tropes, I never really found him annoying. Most likely, this was since his moral compass was kinda skewed, which made him a little more interesting to watch. 
When I think of Killua, I definitely think there’s lost potential. Often, and this is not just his character but many others in the show, his actions are shaped by what the story needs of him. To further elaborate, this means who he is as a character becomes inconsistent. If the show needs him to be Gon’s loyal companion he’ll be that, when the show needs him to be a heartless assassin, he’ll then switch to that, and so on. You don’t often see these different sides of him blend together to make a complex character.
Kurapika and Leorio, “the kinda but not main characters”, are both pretty great. Kurapika is probably my favourite character in the entire show. He is very consistent, has a detailed backstory, and a compelling story, especially in the Yorknew City arc. Leorio fell into the lost potential area for me, until I finished the election arc. Though I think Leorio is a decently flawed character, I think it’s mainly due to a lack of development. He ends up feeling like tag-along most of the time, and although he is a great comic relief character, I really hope the manga has given him more depth than the show.
One thing Hunter x Hunter excels at is making great antagonists. In the Yorknew City arc, I wanted to root for Kurapika, but a part of me was so fascinated with the phantom troupe I couldn’t help but not want them to be defeated either. This is sort of similar in the chimera ant arc. Although my affinity to the chimera ants is far less, my favourite characters from this part of the show were probably the enemies. Specifically, Meruem was probably, if not the most, well developed characters in the entire show. 
Enjoyment - Average of 7/10
The hunter exam arc was a little bit of boring to me. Having one exam last 21 episodes is something that I don’t even think any show can pull off, no matter how well executed. I think it set the stage well, however I wish they had foreshadowed nen more heavily in the beginning of the series, as it’s one of the most important concepts in the show. Though, I really liked seeing the friendship form between Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio (8/10).
The Zoldyck family arc is a short one, so you would think they would try to fit more in that time frame. Nope. My main enjoyment from this part was purely from learning more about Killua’s past, which was quite intriguing. Additionally, meeting new characters like Canary and Milluki were a highlight of this arc. Though, in regard to the story, I can’t really name one thing this arc served to advance, other than some forced character development. (7/10).
The heaven’s arena arc is one that wasn’t inherently bad, but for someone who cares little for combat, it didn’t interest me. The appealing aspect of this arc to me, was learning what nen was and seeing how each person used their abilities so contrastingly. Nonetheless, nen could’ve been explained better. I’m not into spoon-feeding information to the audience, but the explanation should be adequate enough where most viewers understand the concept. (7/10).
The Yorknew City arc is what made me not drop the show. It’s well constructed and genuinely had me at the edge of my seat. I especially loved how Gon, Killua, and Leorio’s adventure naturally ended up intertwining with Kurapika's. The emotions in this arc are raw, and it had less corny moments than much of the rest of the show. Of course I could nitpick for flaws, but this was the height of the show for me. (10/10).
And after Yorknew City, came the downfall of Greed Island. Okay don’t get me wrong, I may tease this arc relentlessly, but it wasn’t that bad. I think I would’ve seen Greed Island as mediocre if it wasn’t for the Yorknew City arc that just raised my expectations way too much for the show. As a result, Greed Island ended up looking terrible in comparison. But seriously, four episodes for one game of dodgeball? (5/10)
Thought it wouldn’t get worse? Here comes the chimera ant arc. Truthfully, I have a love hate relationship with this arc. A part of me recognizes the amazing characters, the genuinely interesting premise, the amount of character development. Meruem's story is especially captivating. Yet, the terrible pacing kills everything I had just mentioned. Once again, one of the things that frustrates me most about Hunter x Hunter is lost potential. The chimera ant arc is a prime example of this. If the episode list was cut in half, I think this would've been up there with Yorknew City. Sadly, that’s not the case. (5/10)
After the chimera ant arc, the election arc was a breath of fresh air. It’s practically the reverse effect Greed Island had on me, only this time I can’t tell if the election arc was actually that good or if it was just so much better compared to the chimera ant arc. In spite of that, this arc has a lot going for it. Being more focused on Killua and Leorio, I feel like it patched up some of the negligence towards their characters that was prevalent in the beginning of the show. Alluka’s character was a great addition to the show and I found the election process, and all its candidates, was hilarious and entertaining. Once again, I could nitpick flaws, but I won’t. (9/10)
Overall - 8/10
Although I was pretty harsh reviewing the show, it was a net positive experience for me, so I’ll give it a more positive rating than I anticipated. This show is just way too inconsistent for my taste, but I can’t neglect that people like it for a reason. I felt I should post this review since most I’ve seen are undoubtedly for or against the show and I wanted to add an honest and somewhat unbiased review.",8

                HxH is an anime that at first glance might look like a children's anime, kinda like Pokemon or even DragonBall, but given time i can guarantee you you'll think otherwise. The large amount of episodes as it often does, allows for great character development (mostly) and throughout has some of the best fighting scenes in anime as a whole. Dramatic battles, particularly later on in the series are common but remain equally awesome, with genius buildup to some of the character clashes that other anime such as Fairy Tail simply don't have. Possibly my favourite feature of the anime is the villains, and there are
                  a decent amount of em to. From Hisoka to the phantom Troupe, old villains tie in with new ones as backstories of fascinating characters are skilfully revealed just as you think you know your HXH! and as always, the anime holds important lessons in life, to enjoy all the little bits in between ""You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest, because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want""",8

                I have only watched around 40 anime so maybe one day I'll find better, but I just gotta say something: This is the best anime I came across so far. The characters, the music, the story, the animation, the plot twists, the everything. It has been 3 months since I finished it and I'm still in pain because of that. Yes, Hunter x Hunter is very long, but it's totally worth watching, trust me! If you are into shounen, go for it. And the characters were so well written that I grew very attached to them.
I will forever treasure the memories I made watching this
                  masterpiece and it will forever have a special place in my heart.",10
"
                Hunter X Hunter, where do I begin. Saying this is a masterpiece is an understatement. HxH was the second anime I've ever watched so my experience is not the best. With that being said, let's dive into my review.
Story - 10/10
The story is quite simple, the main character, Gon Freecss, wants to become a Hunter because his dad became one and Gon thinks this is the way he can find out who his dad is. Gon goes to the Hunter Exams and meets Kurapika and Leorio. Kurapika wants to become a Hunter to avenge the Kurta Clan and get back their special eyes (Kurta eyes
                  kind of look like Sharingan Eyes if you've seen Naruto). Leorio wants to become a Hunter so he can get enough money to become a Doctor. Later on in the Exam the 3 of them meet Killua Zoldic, an assassin who doesn't want to become a Hunter, but is doing the exam as a challenge/for fun. This story is fairly simple but is very entertaining. My favorite Arc is the Heavens Arena Arc, due to the introduction of Nen and also watching Hisoka V Gon and Hisoka V Kastro.
Art 8/10
Madhouse did a great job with the Animation and I love the character designs of everyone, especially Killua. 
Sound 8/10
Soundtrack is nice, nothing too special but the ending song of the Greed Island Arc is just... godly. 
Character 9/10
Characters are great, especially Leorio. You can really feel what their feeling at the moment (seeing Gon's face after realizing Kite is dead make sad). Only problem I have is that Kurapika and Leorio are only utilized in 3 out of the 6 arcs. 
Enjoyment 10/10
Laughed, cried, and enjoyed the ride. No doubt the best Anime I've seen and have rewatched multiple times.
Overall 10/10
Only thing it's missing is the Chrollo V Hisoka fight, (Best fight in the Whole Series but hasn't been adapted to the Anime). Thanks for reading this terrible review and stop reading this and go watch it!",10

                One of my absolute favourite shonen of all time, can't really pinpoint what made me love it, the art was fantastic(movie quality even) the story was compelling it didn't really bound me to the main cast but let me enjoy the characters and the hole world which really sucked me in. The music was just so good, it fit the story really well, i have alot of it in my own playlist. over all it just a fantastic show, almost a masterpiece but not quite. it is just a great show that pulled me in start to end. i recommend it to anyone who is
                  a shonen watched, if u get thrown off by the first couple of episodes just give it a shot, it is not what it seems at first.",10

                Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a show that is considered one of the best anime of the 2010s and one of the best shounen ever made.
The show has great a narrative and great storytelling. The way each arc transitions into the next is done well.
The Hunter Exam is probably the best opening arc for a shounen I’ve seen. It’s a perfect set up arc. Heaven’s arena and Greed Island are great arcs as well.
The show has phenomenal action sequences and spectacular visuals. Madhouse does an incredible job with the animation; character and location design are both unique and vibrant. 
The show has some great characters
                  with my favorites being Killua and Hisoka; these two command attention when they’re on screen especially Hisoka; he oozes charisma in every frame he’s in. I also like many of the supporting characters like kite and biscuit.
Most of the characters are great and relatable such as Kurapika and Leorio. The show knew how to make characters feel badass. 
I loved the antagonists of the show, specifically Meruem; he was complex and had the best development in the show.
The comedy and drama perfectly complement each other. 
My main issues with the show are the main character and a dragged story. 
Gon lacks that it factor a main should have. He doesn’t develop much and isn’t very compelling.
The Phantom Troupe arc, which started in the most epic way possible turned into a huge letdown. The Chimera Ant arc dragged on and got boring in its climax. Still both have spectacular moments.
Also the final arc not being adapted makes the show feel incomplete. 
Kurapika and Leorio feel like supporting characters rather than main characters which is infuriating. 
The musical score is serviceable. The opening is decent but gets old after a while. Ending themes are forgettable aside from the 3rd one.
Also they way the show ends had me throw my Han up in the air because of the loose ends and wasted potential.
Hunter x Hunter is a decent anime that could have been so much better. It has its moments but it feels average",7

                I've never thought that I will watch any long anime series. But then I heard many recommendations for this anime and after the first few episodes, it intrigued me. My anime list isn't very huge yet, but anyways this anime has best combat scenes in comparison with all other anime series that I saw.
A story is really great but occasionally lengthy. I didn't except that anime based mainly on combats will be so deep. An art quality is pretty fine but surely not best that I saw. Soundtracks and other sound effects are really of high quality. Characters are fine as well but still, there
                  are surely things to work on. I really enjoyed this anime and I believe if you like this kind of anime then after a few episodes it will totally take you. I give it overall 9/10 score, maybe it's worth even 10/10 but I am unlucky very critic.",9

                Eu adoro como essa masterpiece entra em todos os clichês de shounem e desconstrói isso muito bem unindo os conceitos de dark e maduro de uma maneira formidável. Eu acho que eu nunca embarquei em uma história com personagens tão realistas e que me fizeram ficar deitado na cama olhando pro teto e pensando por tantas horas. Hunter x Hunter foi um daqueles animes que a soundtrack me fez chorar; isso tanto no antigo quanto no clássico, eu chorei com Ohayou e especificamente com Reason, na parte em que o Gon e o Killua se separam e a música de preview de episódio eu sentia
                  que eu estava em um avião com um daqueles pilotos",10

                Hunter x Hunter is one of the best anime that I had to watch. The story of this anime is very flowy and makes me want to keep up in every episode. This story shows the different sides of all character stories in detail. All character had their development and their goals to achieve. Also, the friendship in this story makes me want to support them. The art of this story is unique but not that attractive to me. The sound is suitable for every scene. I really enjoyed this anime and I would like to recommend it to all of you. Enjoy watching Hunter

                Eu descobri hunter x hunter recentemente (2014), quando estavam lançando os últimos episódios da versão 2011. Desde então é meu anime preferido, ja revi ele varias vezes, e mensalmente revejo os arcos e releio o manga, enfim, vamos a review.
A história gira em torno de Gon Freeccs, meu personagem preferido do anime. O que mais me agrada na história de hunter x hunter é que todos os arcos estão ligados de maneira natural e sutil, sem quebras ou furos na historia. Apesar de muita das informações serem limitadas e serem apresentadas de forma ""surpresa"" como os hatsus de killua e leorio, ou até mesmo mortes
                  esperadas e inesperadas.
O desenvolvimento dos personagens é simplesmente magnífico, onde não se ve um protagonista que ganha tudo de mão beijada, mas também é rápida o suficiente para que não se entedie ou se passe a odiar o/os protagonistas. Os personagens são totalmente humanizados, com emoções, entretanto não se passa um sentimento, onde até mesmo os vilões querem o bem de sua família, ou sentimento de prisão àquilo, pois por trás de qualquer ato, há uma justificativa lógica.
Ao contrario de muitos shonens que só jogam lutas na cara do telespectador, hunter x hunter varias vezes te prende ao pensamento dos lutadores, mostrando como cada um pensa a partir de cada acontecimento. Em uma batalha nem sempre o mais forte vence, em uma batalha nem sempre o "" poderzinho especial "" determina o vencedor, em uma batalha o protagonista nunca tira um poder extremamente forte do nada.
No arco das formigas, com a ""introdução"" do narrador, o anime ganhou um novo modelo, onde prendia minha atenção e raciocínio, me fazendo pensar em como um conjunto de coincidencias poderiam ajudar ou atrapalhar determinados personagens.
O manga em si ja é uma obra prima, com um estúdio como a mad house então, não é difícil que alguem vicie na obra e fique revendo cenas bem animadas e dirigidas.",10

                Its a great show, if you can push through the first season, I assure you that u will not regret it, the show is great after the first arc, the way it turns from a happy trying to find your father, making friends and achieving your goal show into a dark show with some remarkable character developments and an amazing plot, it was extraordinary, so its definitely a worth watch.
The story follows a young boy named gon, who was abandoned by his father at a small age, the boy grows up and aspire to become a hunter just like his father, in order to get
                  info on him and eventually find him, in his quest the boy meets Kurapika who wishes to find the lost eyes of his tribe by becoming a hunter and also getting revenge on those who massacred his tribe, leorio who aspires to become a hunter in order to earn money for becoming a doctor and last of all, killua zoldyck who come from family of ferocious assassin's and wants to become a hunter because it seems fun. The story follow and these three end up becoming really good friends and help each other to achieve their goals.
Best - the relation between killua and gon can move anyone heart, their friendship and their felling of self sacrifice for those they hold dear is something anyone can take a lesson from.
The plot twist are amazing with things upside down in moment.",8

                This anime is a mess.  There is so much that doesn't feel like it matters at all and is covered with missed potential virtually everywhere.  However, what it does is absolutely fantastic.  The somewhat ""average"" idea of characters using aura (nen) is brought to its fullest potential showing the personalities of many characters.  However, I didn't get too emotionally attached to the characters and there were some easy fixes that could have made multiple arcs better.   Studio Madhouse did an excellent job cleaning up the manga which admittedly, looks not great. Overall, it is glaring with missed opportunity but
                  what it does right it does so masterfully.",9

                Hello everyone, it is me again, your favorie SS rank reviewer! XD ok, jokes aside, i am going to give you all a quick and simple, yet helpful review without spoilers, as i always say, i like people to fall fresh on the series, so let's get into it. The series has Togashi's way of telling a story more matured since he wrote Yu Yu Hakusho, so you can expect a more dense plot and better developed characters, the start is slow and simple and very down to earth, Togashi is a genius that knows how to start a series, cause he knows that a
                  good Shounen needs to have a story that is buyable, nobody (especially nowadays where animes are pretty much watched everywhere) buys a story where some dude gets strong cause the author said so or cause he saw his friend drinking water and thought ""OH i could use water as a power"" and bang, asspull done sucessfully, he knows that series like that start well but in the end fall apart, as they are not solid built from the begginig, and this is the case with some works these days were everyone gets hyped and then it falls apart cause of protagonism and asspull after asspull, not wanting to critized or negative a show for nothing, but Fairy tail and Bleach are examples of that, the story looked nice from the beggining but keeping the same formula or trying to make weird stuff ruined them, while other works like Boku no Hero and One punch Man(even though it is pretty much a seinen)are the opposite,these two are really well done, but ok, going back to HxH, that is the difference on Togashi's work,  the start catches you cause of its simplicity and character quality and slowly starts to speed up and get even more dense, the way the anime ends shows how great of a writer Mr Togashi is, i wish the manga ended where the anime did :( But that is a story for another day, and oh btw, the characters are perfect, go it out bro, enough talk around here, see yaaa",10
"
                The Phantom Troupe Arc and Chimera Ant Arc were the only good arcs in my opinion. Luckily, the Chimera Ant Arc is ~50 episodes, and it was all spectacularly crafted. In both these arcs, the story gets dark, and we see some character development in Kurapika and Killua, respectively. The worst part for me was the length of the series i.e. the time it took to get to these two arcs. The other arcs are very stereotypical shounen, with the Hunter Exam Arc being the most intolerable in this respect. Side note: you will get annoyed w/lack of OST in beginning of series. 
The series
                  took me over a year to finish because I kept tuning out midway through these lesser arcs. It took friends nagging to get me to finish, but I'm glad I did. The Chimera Ant arc really redeems the rest of the show.",9
"
                Probably going to get some disapproving glances for only giving it a 7, but hear me out. Also, I am not always the most eloquent person, but I will try my best to get my point across without rambling too much. 
*Spoilers ahead*
I was having a great time with the anime until the Greed Island Arc. The Yorknew arc was my favourite because I love Kurapika's story line and the Uvogin vs Kurapika fight was my absolute favourite.
The Greed Island arc was fine, just a little drawn-out in my opinion, and I feel Greed Island the place was extremely over-hyped by the characters on terms
                  of difficulty to beat and the deadliness of the situation. You didn't even need to beat the game to leave for christ's sake- anyone who knew nen well enough could leave Greed Island easily.
But regardless, the arc was needed to set up the events of the Chimera Ant Arc as well as solidify Gon and Killua's skills and establish Gon as a selfish and childish character (when he beats Genthru without sticking to the plan) and the Dodgeball fight was probably my second favourite of the whole series.
Now, The Chimera Ant arc.
I understand why people like it- it's just not for me. I wasn't a fan of the slow start first of all, I feel that a good 5 episodes were all but wasted on explanation and basically just walking around NGL until the king was born. Yes explanation was needed, but that amount? Not really. Not to mention, the character design of the Chimera Ants are so ugly it took me out of my emersion at certain points. Yes, I get a lot of shounen have weird character designs, but there is a difference between out-there style choices and just plain BAD style choices. For instance, Jojo's art is weird as hell but it adds to the funky, bizarre story, and once you get used to it, the art becomes quite appealing and one learns to appreciate it.
This is not the case for HxH. Why are we expected to take a wolf man wearing a thong seriously. And an octopus that is basically just a blob with eyebrows? I dunno man, I really wasn't into most the Ant's designs.
The castle invasion sequence was so overhyped for me. I wasn't a fan at all of the way so many fights start and then just never end. I didn't feel suspense at all because I didn't care about the side characters. They were introduced like 15 episodes ago and we're supposed to care about them as much as Gon and Killua, who we've been with since the very beginning? 
The fights are so drawn out and over explained it became almost painful to watch. Show not tell, please- that is what animation is for. To show us what is happening, to convey emotion through faces and body language and even environment. I also would've rather had more inner monologue rather than the narrator just downright telling us what the character is feeling. That too, brought me out of my emersion. I felt more like I was being read a textbook than watching a show with characters and plot at certain points.
Frankly, I also thought Netero's power was sort of lame. I was really looking forward to seeing Meruem and Netero fight- but, I'm sorry, I just couldn't find it cool- Netero's backstory was certainly very interesting but his nen ability is just a giant golden statue y'all??? I study Buddhism at the school I attend, and whilst I thought the reference to Boddhisatvas and other Buddhist traditions was pretty clever, I don't know why but it just didn't appeal to me at all.
The last 5 or so episodes of the arc were great though. The way everything ties together, the ending and ironic twist of fate where the remaining ants die due to a shameful human bomb that makes humans no better than the ants themselves- it was extremely enticing the watch. It's just a shame I had to sit through mind-numbingly boring fights to reach those last golden episodes.
And yes, I did cry at Meruem and Komugi's death. Alas, he was finally human.
Meruem's character story as a whole is the main reason I would say The Chimera Ant arc isn't completely bad. The toying of the ideas of the fine line between human and ant, the idea that one can choose whether to be monster or human- that a monster could learn to love and the way his love was so unexpecting of Komugi because after all- he doesn't hold societies standards of who should be loved, and Komugi is loved because he wants to love her, and he has no external ideology stopping him from doing so. He loves Gungi, and he loves Komugi, and so he decides to die a human with the person he loves, regardless iof if that person is blind or snotty or if they only care about Gungi. And that was beautiful.
Anyways, it probably sounds like I really hate the Chimera Ant arc, and though it was my least favourite to sit through, in hindsight it was quite artful. The cinematic parallels of Meruem and Gon were so interesting, the way they both teeter on the edge of human and monster simultaneously, and Killua's character development! The way he overcomes his family's torment, and it leads him to finally realise the new path he must take in the final arc. Just... *chef's kiss*
I suppose it was worth sitting through boring parts to reach, but if I ever decide to re-watch you can bet your ass I'm watching the boring parts at 2x speed or in dub because- fuck that. 3 minutes passing in what, 7 episodes? Nah.
The final arc was pretty great too, I enjoyed Alluka and Killua's interactions immensely, and the comeback of many characters I had grown to miss during the Chimera Ant arc, considering none of the supporting characters in said arc really captured my attention like the originals did.
For further reference, I feel it's necessary to point out that I personally am more into fights in anime that flow and can be seen on screen rather than told.
If you're the type that enjoys a lot of explanation and narration, as well as slower but more insightful fight sequences and intricate power systems, then you will love this show! But personally, I am more into stylised and fun fight sequences when it comes to action, that aren't based on such a tight-knit fighting system such as nen. Though I enjoyed Jojo a whole bunch, usually confusing and long fights aren't my cup of tea.
Final ranking explanations:
Story: 7, The Chimera Ant arc brings it down slightly for pacing
Art: 6, It was alright. Some fight scenes were amazing but the character design for so much of it was just YIKES.
Sound: Holy shit the SOUNDTRACK. THE OPENING, THE ENDINGS, THE OSTS YES!!!!
Character: 9, Would be a 10 if The Chimera Ant supporting characters weren't so boring to me. I genuinely didn't care about anyone but Meruem, Komugi, Gon, Killua, Neferpitou, Colt and Morel. That's barely any of the cast considering how many characters were introduced. Regardless, there was some amazing character development in this. 
Enjoyment: 7, again, I got so bored at the explanations. I like fast-paced things, y'all.
Overall: 7. Still a great show. Just not my cup of tea in many areas. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece in all honesty.",7

                This is my first review ever and I am very excited about it. I divided the structure into good/negative points, conclusion and rating.
At start, the good points:
You can easily be invested into the story and specially on its characters and their relationship. There is also a factor of unpredictability in which most of the time you are unable to predict what comes next, and that increases your eagerness letting you hungry for more plot. One thing that increases this unpredictability is the concept of hunters, which can be vastly explored: for example, you can have relics hunters, lost place hunters, beast hunters and even human
                  hunters, an endless ocean of ideas. The author carries character strength very seriously, so that for few times in my life I could see main characters useless and doing nothing in certain situations because they were too weak. There is no forced victory, but this brings a negative point that I will cover later. The best character for me was Killua, since he had the most well worked development. I started the show hating him and finished it crying over every sad expression on his face. We have got a bit of development for Gon as well, but what took my attention was the sacrifice he did to defeat an enemy, theoretical killing all his future possibilities on the plot. I cannot watch Gon story without feeling a deep sadness and at the same time I congratulate the author for taking a huge decision such this: if Gon story is really over, it takes some courage to cut off all the possible shounen plots just to teach a lesson that life can goes down very easy only because a moment of darkness. And, for the opposite, if there is still adventures for Gon, the author has creativity in continue a character plot that was nearly over (if this continuation is going to be well executed, of course).
Negative points:
For a shounen anime, the fights are quite disappointing. The point in where weak adversaries do not fight against the stronger, something I praised above, turns out for you not seeing creative battles where a weak enemy try to defeat a stronger one and maybe achieving success. As Itachi the philosopher once said “there is no jutsu without a weakness”, and so, by analogy, there is no Nen technique without weakness too, but I do not feel this concept was explored on the plot. By the way, since the given potential of hunter x hunter, many things were not explored: at one side, this open up for more future plots, but in the other hand, it lefts a void, a feeling of “I want more”. These disappointed fights are the main flaw at Chimera Ant arc: you have 10 episodes of fighting when the palace invasion starts, and these fights would be theoretically awesome, but in the end, does not happened anything if you look deep into it. The characters just walked from here to there, there were few moments when Nen techniques were used to change the course of battle, and all the fights could have last only 3 episodes. Therefore, some of the best fights lasted less than 10 minutes, being a one well executed attack and end. I would like to see the author exploring more the battles, making most of the fights more impactful, as the majority of shounen shows tend to do and it is one thing I praise the most on this genre. This is the reason why I liked so much on Gon versus Genthru at the Greed Island arc, because it passed an atmosphere of shounen battle, with both working their techniques and strategies to defeat thein enemy at all cost, and more importantly: a fight that did not last less than 5 minutes.
Conclusion:
As it is a show with many episodes, hunter x hunter did not maintain the pace all the time, having some episodes more boring than others, but what really pays off for the anime is: the phantom troupe, the chimera ant, the brilliant nen system and the last 18 episodes. It is incredible to watch the show atmosphere change as at episode 30 it appears like a common shounen anime and at episode 148 ends that way. But, as the hunter x hunter fanbase used to say: this is hunter x hunter.
Rating:
I calculated a mean score for every arc and it results in an 8. However, since I watched hunter x hunter over two weeks, without stopping, barely sleeping and in the moments before sleep I was still thinking about the show, if I would rate an 8, that would be unfair to myself. Hunter x hunter lefts a mark on me that will never goes away, such as Naruto, Steins; Gate, Mirai Nikki and Koe no Katachi did it. Basically, for personal reasons and external factors, like the quarantine, I will remember this moment forever. The show has its minor flaws, but if I could rate a 10 on the shows I mentioned before, why I would not rate a 10 on hunter x hunter?",10
"
                Objectively the best story arc within this show is York New City because the story following The Phantom Troupe and Kurapika is intriguing to watch. Since they killed his entire clan and family, he is getting revenge which makes it it interesting in terms of the psychology. The Chimera arc is has worse pacing than One Piece but it's still pretty good because you get to see all the characters use their powers. The animation is pretty fluid for the year 2011. The friendship between Gon and Killua stays really solid throughout the show and is interesting to follow. It is like Romeo and Juliet
                  but platonic. I highly recommend this show who like action with a hint of mystery and a riveting plot.",9
"
                I cant rate hunter x hunter with a 10 for one single reason.The fact that the manga is still ""ongoing"".The end was satifactory leaving like 1/4 uncovored in a way(dont want to spoil anythig)Problem is we dont surely know that the manga will even finish at the time i am writing thise there havent been a new manga for quite some time and this has happened several times over.Even if the manga manages to reach its final ending there is nothing to guarantee the anime will continue  that they will even bother to adapt the rest of the manga material.Unfortunately there examples of this
                  happening allready with other anime cough* magi cough*.
TL:DR Even though there is still material left to adapt and to be released i can easily recommend this anime to anyone  and it will definitely be worth the while, usualy i feel hesitant to recomment an anime that fall into that category.",9
"
                     Reviewing this show as a whole is hard to do. For me it is split into either Ant King arc, and Not Ant King arc. The show is a 7.1 at its worst and a 9.5 at its best, making the show a good 8.8 overall in my opinion. In this review I will try to judge the show for into entire content.
     The characters are great. People talk about a shows pacing when it comes to ploy, but people ignore a character’ pacing. Not all characters are paced perfectly, but when they are, this show
                  does it better than any other show. A lot of characters are super intriguing but then never fully developed, Pariston and Chrollo, for example. However characters like Meruem, Gon, and even Shoot are burnt into your memory. The Phantom Troupe is in between these two categories of characters. They have a criminally low amount of character development, yet are super fleshed out in the overall world of the show, like they are a force of nature rather than a group of characters.
     The world of Hunter X Hunter is astonishing. The worlds rules feel very limiting at first, but the characters still have a lot of varied abilities. The different regions in every arc are all distinct from one another, having different colors and cultures, which feeds into the shows ending reveal. Even though the end of the show is not completely satisfying because of unresolved plot lines, the world makes it feel like this is intended.
     To me, plot and story are two different things. Hunter X Hunter shows exactly why. Plots are the adventure, and the story is the lessons learned in each adventure, making story like the glue that fits the plot together. The story and plot are both decent. Then the Ant King arc comes along and just wipes the floor with the show thus far. You are moved to tears by the story. It is a travesty that the show ends so soon after this arc.
     The Ant King arc is a triumph. It firmly keeps it spot as one of the best in all of anime history. It must be noted that the rest of the show pales in comparison to this arc. Overall, I like the world of the Not Ant King arc and I love the story of the Ant King arc.",8

                Hunterxhunter is one of the first animes I’ve watched. With that being said this review might be a little bias. I absolutely love Hunterxhunter and it might be my favorite anime. 
Season 1 was the hunter exams which was the perfect way to introduce this amazing anime. It introduced some of my favorite characters and showed how good this anime could get. 8/10
Season 2 was one of my favorite seasons because of the tournament/arena arc. I loved how they introduced nen by mr wing teaching them. Gon vs Hisoka was also an amazing fight and to see how they improved thei abilities with nen. 9/10
Season
                  3 was the phantom troupe arc and I have some mixed feelings. A lot of people say that it’s the best season but honestly i think it’s just good. Chrollo was an amazing villain and I liked most of the phantom troupe. But I kinda got bored at some parts and I think it’s a little overated. 7.5/10
Season 4 was the greed island arc and I can say it’s pretty good. The villain was kinda bad but I really liked the introduction to bisky. I also really liked the game aspect and especially the dodgeball game with Hisoka. It’s not really memorable but it’s good to say the least. 7.5/10
Season 5 was my absolute favorite. The chimera ant arc is still my favorite arc to this day. The pacing in the beginning might be slow but this arc was soooo worth it. I loved Meruem and he might be my favorite character in hxh. He is definitely the best villain so far and his guards were also very interesting. The only complaint I have is the length and i don’t understand why gon got so mad about kite dying when he barely knew him. Aside from that this is the best hxh has to offer. 10/10
Season 6 was mediocre prob because I didn’t really like any of the characters introduced. Ging is a terrible father but I guess he came back at the end. This is prob the worst season imo but it’s still pretty good. 7/10
I know that it makes no sense that I rated this series a 10/10 but only have one season with a 10/10 but the characters and the enjoyment was incredible and gave memories I would never forget. I love hxh with everything and I def recommend this series. The music and ost is amazing. 10/10 Also the story is amazing if you haven’t noticed. 10/10 Overall hxh is a 10/10 imo and I plan to rewatch it in the future. Thank you for reading this review have a good day. 😊",10

                I started watching anime since I was 6 years old, and I am almost 27 now. In those 20 years, the two anime that got the most impact on me are HxH 2011 and Steins Gate (I prefer the former more). 
HxH must be the closest anime to perfection. Almost everything about it is outstanding. 
The characters are well written and developed. It's easy to notice that Togashi takes his job seriously when you look at his characters. Especially the villains who are among the best villains in all types of fiction, not only anime. One of these HxH 2011 villains is my favorite of
                  all time. Those who already watched the show know who I am talking about.  The dialogues are rich and feel intresting and full of meaning, while keeping real and realisitic. You can feel that the carachters are real and alive when you hear them speak. 
The story might sound average if you hear about it without watching the anime, but gosh, Togashi knew how to make a ""12 yo boy looking for his father"" so damn good. Every single arc is different ad has its own strenghs and style. No other anime will take you through mortal exam, samll tournement, mafia and crime, a game in a ""virtual"" world, an epic fight for the survival of humanity, than a crazy election full of mind games and tension.  An each arc has a LOT of depth and great writing, while talking about many deep and complex themes. 
The sound is a true masterpiece, especially the 3rd part of the OST, that are played during the Chimera ant arc. The music I listen the most to on my phone is actually ""Kingdom of Predators"" from HxH 2011. There other amazing OST like The legend of the Martial Artist, Elegy of the Dynast, To Give a Marionnette Life, etc. 
The only problem with HxH is that it leaves a void in you after finishing it. It sets the bar too high, not only for anime, but for fiction in general. It's a perfect 10/10 for me.",10

(I'm new to this site so if this review is shit to you, don't get mad)
ok to start this anime off let me just say that i think hxh is a VERY good anime but its simply just not as good as people act like it is to me. I love it, but i think its overrated. hxh fans are absolutely crazy. they will send death threats to people that don't like this anime that much. a bit ridiculous if you ask me. Every hxh fan goes crazy over this. They constantly go on talking about how much of a masterpiece this is but is
                  it wrong that I can't exactly agree? I think hxh is good but not THAT good. A anime that i'd consider a masterpiece is attack on titan because i enjoyed every arc, every character, there is no plot armor, the story is fantastic, & its just really darn good. When it comes to hxh though, i didn't really enjoy all the arcs. hunter exam arc was fine, chimera ant arc was great, the tower fighting thing was cool, but the killua rescuing arc and the whole thing with kurapika was a bit boring to say the least. I know some people enjoyed these the most, but they borderline bored me out. This is just my personal opinion, but it still affects my rating. The story is okay. its not bad. i can't say there is anything bad about it. The plot is okay. The characters are okay. I can't find fault with these points. The only thing that i dislike about hxh is the 2 arcs that i talked about, but when a anime only has 8 arcs, this is a bad look for that anime. Overall, i'd rate this anime a 8. I don't think that this anime is so good, that you should bash people for not liking it. its just okay. its very good but its not a masterpiece.",8

                The thing with HunterxHunter for me is that... It is just FACTUALLY one of the best anime ever created... Even without my personal opinion this anime is a masterpiece. It is by far one of the best shows I have ever watched. Not even my personal favorite but just AMAZING... Especially the soundtrack and characters stand out a lot. No idea how long my review has to be soooo.... The chimera ant arc is phenomenal, but tbf every arc in this anime is fantastic. The art is good, the music is outstanding EVERYTHING JUST WORKS. IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED IT WATCH IT RN

                Hunter X Hunter is one of my favorite animes. I came across this anime after I was watching a 
little bit of Naruto and it struck me how there were so many similarities between the two. So I 
decided to give this a try and I'm so glad I did. The story is simple and if you want to know 
what it's about then just read the summary provided by mal. The biggest strength of this 
show is it's story and the main character.First, the story,like I said, is simple which I think is the best recipe for shounen animes. It is 
easy to follow along and understand the problems and motivations of the character. The story 
is consistent with the goals of the main character which most shounen animes tend to mess 
up. I feel an urgency for Gon to find his father and also sympathize with his struggles. Their is 
a clear goal and I see Gon reaching closer to fulfilling that goal and that is what gives this 
anime the compliment of successful progression. I define successful progression as the story 
advancing due to the efforts made by the MC to reach his dreams. Some animes make the 
mistake of wandering into foreign places and forgetting the fact that the main character has a 
goal and by straying off the paths of that goal the story is not progressing at all. The story of 
Gon enduring hardships, making friends, going on adventures, and most importantly reaching
his goal is what makes Hunter X Hunter superior to Naruto and overall a great anime.",8
"
                I wont be going into any details of this anime, its not my thing after all. I just wanted to review my favorite anime of all time. HxH for me is a life changing experience, i am not exaggerating or taking things out of proportions. I watched  it a year ago during christmas vacation and a year have passed and still nothing can top this in my opinion. Opinions aside this is easily the best written anime of all time. And this is a fact regardless of your opinion. Being capable of creating a vast and intriguing world as the hunter verse is really
                  an impressive feat. This anime is for the thinkers and learners out there. If you like to learn from life and grow wiser from it this anime is for you. All thinkers will learn something from this anime for sure even if they didnt like it. Thx for your time. Hxh is da best and peace out.",10

                Hunter x Hunter is an anime that is carried by incredible characters, design, and ideas. The characters in this show are written incredibly well allowing you to see their psyche and what motivates them. You even come to love even the villains such as Meruem who at the beginning is the most hateful As*hole. People like Killua, Hisoka, Kurapika, and Leorio are incedibly well written and leave a ton of room for you to love them. Not just the characters make this show enjoyable. The art, voice acting, and sound design for a 2011 show are great making you feel like this show came out
                  recently. There are also some very well written arcs of this show engrossing you in the story.
However, this show does have a couple of relatively large flaws with this show and the main one is pacing. This show could have been 120 episodes and not 150. Hunter x Hunter finds it very hard to know what the watcher wants to see. They show you these awesome fights with great action, then leave the characters doing what feels like just waiting. For example, the first half of the chimera ant arc before the king is born, this show just drags on showing the watcher things that have almost no affect later. I finished this show an hour ago and I have already forgotten what 90% of what happened before the king was born. Also, some other arcs are kinda mediocre like the first 25 episodes of the show are very middle of the road. 
Either way, this show has great action, art, voice acting, charm, and especially characters. I would give it an 8.5 but I'll round it up.",9

                This anime is really touching, I can’t describe it in words. I can just say that this made me smile, cry, laugh, angry,... a mixture of different emotions. This anime is beautiful, I would definitely recommend this. 10/10 :’))
The story arcs are unique in their own ways. Although you might hesitate to continue after starting the Chimera Ant Arc, but rest assured, you need to watch after episode 85 first before making conclusions. I was hesitant too, but as the story progressed, it was better than I expected. You might end up crying a lot, but, it’s all worth it in the end 😭♥️♥️ That’s
                  all~ Arigatouuu! Salutations to the writer ☺️",10

                Sinceramente um anime incrível, apesar de algumas falhas minúsculas que não atrapalham o roteiro, seu desenvolvimento é divertido e emocionante sendo um dos meus animes favoritos, como todo anime HxH possui falhas, mas todas acabam sendo esquecidas com o andamento do anime, um de meus arcos favoritos é o das chimera ants, esse foi o primeiro anime que eu vi que realmente me fez me preocupar com o vilão além de querer saber mais sobre ele, sendo capaz de me fazer chorar em várias partes, junte uma história maravilhosa com lutas incriveis e você tera HxH chimera ants, para mim as lutas são apenas um
                  bônus desse arco que torna esse anime digno de ser chamado de uma obra de arte magistral.",10

                HunterXHunter is a magical trip. Words are not suffice to tell what a wonderful experience I had the pleasure to have while watching this masterpiece of a TV-show. The Art style, even though is not the best I've ever seen, is wonderful and fits the vibe of the anime pretty well. The soundtrack is great, but not innovative enough to be called outstanding in my opinion, and I have enjoyed every single minute while watching this anime. However, something that pains me to see was the closure of this anime. It is such an unfortunate event that Togashi Yoshihiro stopped writing HXH due to his
                  health, since we can truly see his genius mind working throughout the whole anime. I have no doubts that if some main arcs were closed, that this would be undoubtedly be a masterpiece, but that did not happen, and we were let with some unfinished developments between characters (Kurapika, Hisoka, Killua's family, Leorio). Nevertheless, what could be finished was exquisite. The bond between Killua and Gon was perfectly explained and the pace of their friendship and their struggles felt natural, organic, logical and emotionally worth of the time spent watching the anime. The universe of HXH is incredible, and is definitely and experience that any anime lover should engage on, and even though it was left unfinished, I can only dream of what would have happened if we had seen its true potential and development!",9

                I created a MyAnimeList account to review this anime, though I will probably end up reviewing more. 
HunterXHunter is a good, but flawed, anime. I'm going to start off by being blunt on how I truly feel: it does not belong to be the #3 anime here, nor even in the top 10. This review will contain some light spoilers, but I will not completely ruin it for you.
I'll start with what is amazing:
The art is 10/10. The drawing is amazing, there's no cheap CGI, the character designs (while heavily influenced by Dragonball, which the manga is as well but I mean, what modern shonen's
                  aren't?), the world. Everything is on point. The monsters look sleek and cool, from downright badass to horrifying wtfness. While the heroes have good designs, especially the members of the Hunters Guild, the series really shines with its villains. Again, the monsters look cool. But the villainous Hunters look even coolor. Hisoka, while I think is inspired by the Joker, is probably my favorite.
The sound is 10/10. The character themes are memorable, especially Hisoka's. I watched both the sub and dub for the first few episodes to decide which to watch. The dub was ok but sub was better, though I also went with it because when I watched this series the dub was incomplete. The music in this show is very good, and so is the voice acting.
Now, to what I think causes me to give this show only a 7 and why it should not be in the top 10.
Story: 7
Character: 6
These would actually be an 8 or higher if not for two things: the latter half of the Chimera Ant Arc and some of what happens in the Hunter Election Arc. I'll try not to spoil too much here. I won't really name too many names. See, up until the Chimera Ant Arc the story, to me, is very gripping. The main characters are discovering what there is out in the world. Hunters, while being loved for hunting monsters, are not all good guys. Some are down right evil mercenaries. There's politics in the Hunter Guild, and it ain't all pretty. After the Greed Island Arc, the quality starts slipping.
Then, the Chirmera Ant Arc. This is when it becomes annoying. The first half of the arc starts out with a lot of promise....and then, well, what may as well be Cell's stunt double shows up. Look, I understand Yoshihiro Togashi was probably very influenced by Dragonball. And to be fair tp the character, he has character development that isn't just ""ARGGH I'M AN EVIL WORLD ENDING VILLAIN"". The allusions to North Korea are pretty neat too. See, the part where the show starts suffering is that it's in the latter part of this arc where the pacing becomes atrocious. They spend something like 30 EPISODES of having a narrator basically spell out a battle scene, because apparently, you, the viewer, are incapable of understanding what is going on in front of you?!
Then, it's back to Hunter politics. Part of that is really awesome, but I feel they butchered certain characters completely. From what I know of the manga, the character motives are explained better there. There's also something really bad, in some attempt to bring back who I guess turned into a fan favorite. It cheapened what happened before. All of this stuff seems rushed, it felt like after they finished the Chimera Arc this part they were like ""oh...we have to adapt this too. It's complex, but we'll do it in 10 episodes lol"". 
And then, the show ends on a gigantic cliffhanger. Now, this is nobodies fault but the anime creators. I understand Hunter X Hunter the manga is not yet finished. Yoshihiro Togashi has been battling illnesses. That's completely reasonable. The show though, imo, should have wrapped things up somewhat without the cliffhanger. It wasn't needed. Especially since there seem to be no plans to adapt the current arc in the manga (understandable as it is not finished yet). They could have wrapped it up in a way that in the future they could come back and adapt more, if they wanted to. It seems like with the last episode they stopped caring.
Edit: Just a quick edit. While I have my grievances of the latter two Arcs, the Chimera Ant Arc does manage to have a VERY GOOD ending. It's just fuzzled by the pacing.",7

                Hunter x Hunter is my favorite anime of all time. I saw this anime since I was in elementary school. A number 1 best anime in all time, for me. I like the characters Gon and Killua. But I prefer the character Killua. Killua is the number 1 best anime character in my opinion. I will continue to love the Hunter X Hunter anime for the rest of my life.
The story tells of a child named Gon Freecss, who one day finds out that his father, who he thought was dead, is apparently still alive and in good health. He learns that his father, Ging,
                  is a legendary ""Hunter"", someone who has proven themselves to be the elite of humanity. Despite the fact that Ging left his son with his relatives to pursue his own dreams, Gon is determined to follow in his father's footsteps by passing the rigorous ""Hunter Exam"", and eventually finds his father after becoming a Hunter on his own.",10
"
                Hunter x Hunter truly deserves the recognition and praise that it still gets, even if it was released over a decade ago. In an era bombarded by the successes of previous shounen predecessors, Yoshihiro Togashi's wonderful mind managed to craft an extremely unique story that juxtaposes itself with other shounen classics. Of course, in regards to the anime at least, Nippon Animation truthfully relayed the works of Togashi and elevated it even further. Nippon Animation polished the art style while splicing memorable sound tracks/openings and most importantly, breathed life into noteworthy action sequences. The following review aims to look at the highs and lows of
                  such an important series.
The Highs: 
Just like other shounen series, the success of a show is often determined by the writing of the protagonist. Gon is a prime example of innocence and purity, a boy who embarked on a journey with a simple goal: to find his father but yet in search of his ambitions, he is thrown into a complex world that challenges his initial point of view. Immediately, he is easily relatable to the audience - a hardworking boy who chases his goal with unyielding determination. Of course like all shounen series, he meets new friends in the form of Killua, Kurapika and Leorio. All of whom are instrumental to his development as a character and his ability to traverse his adversities. These interactions help elevate the story and give meaning to character moments later down the line.
The lore is always an important element to a shounen series. Hunter x Hunter introduces a concept of Nen - a unique approach in giving these character their individual power and skill. As you watch the series, you begin learning all of the intricacies and complex nature of Nen. Also seeing how characters overcome certain boundaries to refine their ability to use and understand Nen. The multifaceted nature of Nen added to the power's mystery and intrigue. While the writing of Nen can be inconsistent at times, it added something new to the pantheon of shounen anime. Where in this case, characters develop their own powers making it so that each character's usage of Nen is unique and thus they embody their own abilities. In some shounen series, characters learn techniques from mentors, while here the mentors only act as a springboard to cultivate characters in achieving their own skills. 
Animation and art as mentioned are top-notched. Super consistent throughout and thus finding a fault is extremely difficult. Even taking into consideration the action sequences. Hunter x Hunter focuses on important and specific action moments. Every time there's an action sequence, it's always special and executed well. 
Character and World Building - Hunter x Hunter introduces us to a plethora of characters, each with their own agenda and worldview. Every character has a sense of intrigue, regardless of their minimal screentime. Notable mentions would be the Phantom Troupe Members, the Zoldyck Family, the Professional Hunters of the Hunter Association and the Chimera Ants. When the path of these characters aligned, there's always a sense of fascination and amazement in the way that they interact with the main cast.
The ending, though not covering the extent of the manga, is a pleasant closure to a long binge-watching journey. With heartwarming scenes, important character interactions and slice of life moments that leave a satisfying taste in the viewer watching. 
The Lows:
The Chimera Ant Arc while highly praised is perhaps one of the least enjoyable arc in my opinion. While it had a darker tone and ominous atmosphere, the stakes were always belittled by some fun character moment. Relieving too much of the tension and thus the story sometimes become somewhat predictable. Not to mention the length of this arc, with 61 episodes, there were several pacing issues and questionable story plot points. These shortcomings also affected the Greed Island Arc as well. 
In all honesty, Gon can be annoying at times. Just like his predecessors  Goku and Naruto, Gon also exudes a sense of arrogance. Though not malicious, this sense of arrogance makes it so that he handles certain situations in an irritative manner. This is particularly prevalent in the Greed Island Arc and the Chimera Ant Arc. But again, just like any protagonist, there's always a shortcoming which further pushes them to improve themselves. 
The show is a slow burner at first, it does take a while for the story to truly become super intense and entertaining. But this ultimately felt natural, even with the large episode count of 148 episodes, Togashi developed a good foundation for Gon and the rest of the cast before exploring newer territories in the story. That way, we are not thrown into shounen mayhem immediately.
Overall, I am extremely delighted to have sat through this one of a kind story like Hunter x Hunter. Though I am disappointed that I will never see the true conclusion of the story. Hopefully Togashi's health improves so that he is able to expand his narrative even further. And hopefully, his expansion will be animated one day :)",9

                Hunter x Hunter is a show that I was able to enjoy mostly throughout the series, but I have been led to write this review in order to dissect each aspect of the show in order to provide my opinions on this series.
Story (6):
Hunter x Hunter is a show where the protagonist, ""Gon"" is interested in becoming a Hunter like his father, ""Ging"". Hunters are people who travel the world accomplishing dangerous feats as well as other unique aspects. Gon never Ging, who ended up leaving his family to continue being a hunter. The main storyline is Gon trying to find his long lost father,
                  and there is constant emphasis on this throughout the show. While this aspect motivates Gon to go through rigorous tasks in the arcs of the show. This main story provides no clarity or importance to the show. While each arcs have their moments to shine, I struggle to understand why the overall story is so valuable or important.
Aesthetic (10):
Hunter x Hunter takes place in a utopia of diverse wildlife, fighting capabilities, enemies, and countless other aspects. This is where I believe is where the series truly shines. It seems that the creator ""Yoshihiro Togashi"" analyzed many theories to truly put this anime to life. The setting is constantly different, where some moments are bright and exploding with color, while other moments is dark and creepy. Two of my favorite arcs in the series consists of the Hunter Exam and Greed Island. In the Hunter Exam, the setting is changing quite often as the characters continue through the exam. Moments where the applicants are running through the fog help truly show the horror they are facing during this exam. As people are disappearing in the thick fog. In Greed Island Gon and Killua simply spawn in an open field, and need to quickly adapt to their surroundings. In this arc, there is so much detail in the later events that take place in order to get the cards they need to win. It seems like all of the cards in the game weren't forgotten about with the various uses and implications in the arc.
Characters (9):
There are many characters in the anime that come-and-go, but each character is unique in their own way. Characters emotions change further and further (as they should), but certain backstories about characters truly help you learn about them. A backstory that really stuck with me was Leorio's, as when you meet him for the first time he constantly claims that he is becoming a Hunter ""Because he wants to be filthy rich"". Which can be a typical factor for many people aiming to be a Hunter, but soon after, Kurapika reads right through his act. We learn about the hardship he faced watching his friend die right in front of him, when there was nothing he could do. We got to see his true motivation, as he wants to become a doctor, and needed to get the money in order to pay for the training. It was something that I found to be a massive curveball as Leorio didn't appear to be too emotional, and was always a jokester (don't get me wrong he still is). As well as Killua's backstory, when you saw him befriend Gon in the exam at first glance he looked like to be a happy kid just like Gon. But we later find out that he is a part of the most notorious assassin families. We can see his ruthless actions when he tears the heart out of the convict in the Hunter exam. In that moment, it looks like Killua is going to die, but he shows his true colors and rips on the guy.
Enjoyment (9):
The fighting in Hunter x Hunter starts kinda straightforward in the Hunter Exam arc, as people are really quick and strong. But in the Heavens Arena arc we learn about nen, and the fighting gets more intricate and unique. We see Gon progress in the show in different aspects, and the fights get more intense. The series trends to be very quickly paced, except for the chimera ant arc which is unbearably slow. While this arc consists of the best fight in the show (IMO), there are constant moments where it is unnecessarily dragged out. To inform you, this arc is over one third of the entire show and it really doesn't need to. While the fights in this arc are intense, it gets boring watching an entire fight stretch out to be so long. While the other arcs have good pacing, through telling a story and delivery action. 
Overall 8
I conclude this show as an 8, as the story doesn't include an intricate plot like other animes. But it truly excels in other aspects with character dynamics, and overall enjoyment the viewer can get. Overall I would recommend this to anyone who is starting to get into anime, and wants to watch a straightforward show. Even though the show may not have the best plot, the excitement from their unique world, and fighting in the show will convince anyone to keep watching this anime.",8
"
                i overall loved the anime the only part where it lacked was the ending, the show ended incomplete, the story the characters were all very great but the rushed ending made me give it a 8, if it wasnt for the ending it wouldve recieved a 10. anyhow this anime is quite good i recommend this to any new weebs :3, the manga and the anime both remain unfinished , hunter x hunter fans would go crazy if the series will continue in the future, this anime is a favorite of millions of people who loved this show when they were a kid and i
                  love it too.",8
"
                This is my favorite anime so far. I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone. Although, for the best experience I would advice to begin the show from the original (1999) version. It has a much better start than this version. You may pick up this version at episode 53 and continue till the end of the anime.
**MINOR SPOILERS NOTHING MAJOR**
CRITICISM: Most of the points I will say here can be avoided by starting with the 1999 version of this show. Most changes from the 1999 version to the 2011 version were for the worse. Honestly, I think the producers felt like neglecting the initial
                  episodes of the anime as they were already covered in the 1999 version.
-> The show has a very poor and seemingly boring start to it. Gon actually meets Leorio in an island and they board the ship together, but all this is skipped in the 2011 anime.
-> There was no introduction to Kite in the beginning episodes in the 2011 version. Later on in the Chimera Ant arc Kite was introduced suddenly and then all of the backstory was dropped quickly. But all that was supposed to be shown in the initial episodes.
-> The Greed Island arc felt a little bit pointless. It was quite a bug jump to go from a ""crime thriller"" focused arc to ""magical card powers inside a game"" arc.
-> Gon luckily was able to magically heal himself with the power of the cards after his fight with Genthru where he lost an arm. There were no consequences. This felt a bit like a typical shounen thing. I would have liked maybe a less critical injury than losing an arm, but that injury persisting in Gon afterwards reminding the veiwers of the time in the Greed Island arc. I liked how later in the Chimera Ant arc Gon was able to heal but still could not use Nen. I would have really liked it if something like that were to happen for the Genthru fight as well.
->Chimera Ant arc felt slightly slow to start, it would have been ideal if it would have been wrapped up in 50 episodes than 60 episodes maybe, nothing major though.
-> Though reasons were there but I was completely against Knuckle's decision to remove the Bankrupcy from Youpi. I personally hated that moment and as a result Knuckle's charater. Also I did not particularly like how Meruem was brought back to life using the ""essence"" of the royal guards after Netero's fight.
Thats all that I can find in the 148 episodes of the show. Everything other than these was brilliant. Amazing art, music and character development and once you will start watching you will find it hard to stop. I watched the whole thing in 3 days during my vacation. Just to mention a few amazing moments from this show amongst the many would be:
-> The friendship of Gon and Killua. I would definitely say that it is one of the best friendships in anime I have ever seen.
  One of the cutest moments of the show according to me was during the Hunter exam arc where they were going to stay in an island for a week where they had to defend their badge and also get badges from others to make a total of 6 points. After everyone were given their badges, all did the smart thing and hid their badges so no one can easily figure out who their target is. It was during this time that Gon and Killua were asking each other about their badge numbers where each was a little bit reluctant to tell the other about their number. They had just been friends for only a few days after all. After that they decided to share their numbers after all. That moment was so cute and cool. It was butchered in the 2011 version, but the 1999 version did it very well.
-> Very unique and enjoyable characters of Hisoka, Netero, Ging Freecs just to name a few!!
-> Amazing character development of Meruem. Many people say that this is not the first time some evil character has turned to the good side and give examples from FMAB Naruto etc. I agree. But this is not about turning to the good side from evil. This is about how the process happened and HxH's Meruem is the best in it. 
   The scene where Meruem was starting to respect human beings, starting to realize that there are other aspects to appreciate in life other than absolute power (brute strength) from Komugi. But then he was swayed again to the dark side by his Royal Guards. After that he decides to go and kill Komugi, but as he enters he sees that an eagle is hurting her. The realization that even if he did nothing Komugi will die. Killing Komugi is nothing to be proud of. And finally to the conclusion that it is the duty of the strong to protect the weak after realizing which he kills the eagle. That scene was SO AMAZING! It alone made this anime separate itself from any other shounen there is.",9
"
                This show will forever be goated. Probably the best anime that I have ever watched. There was so much passion yet conflict and sorrow too. It truly was an emotional rollercoaster. But it was worth it. I really hope the creators will release more episodes, but if not, I guess I'll get to reading. Gon is the joyful person that we all wish we could be. Killua is my overall favorite character though. He's the bada** that I wish I could be. He would do anything for his friend. And this show is proof. He may look nonchalant on the outside but, he truly is
                  a complex ball of emotions. The amount of love he has for Gon is incredible. Killua is also very loyal, the perfect trait for a best friend. He compliments Gon as a friend well. They balance each other out. Anyways, I'll have to end this with a see ya later Hunter x Hunter.",10
"
                2011 adaptation of Hunter x Hunter manga is a perfect example of very well made shounen, and I will tell you, why you should watch Hunter x Hunter, if you didn't yet.
Story: 
Hunter x Hunter story is perfectly written. The individually arcs are absolutely different from each other therefore you won't be bored. Also the anime does not waste any second, thanks to perfect storytelling, and it's tempo is very smooth (unlike the 1999 adaptation). 
Art: 
Madhouse did a great job with animation of Hunter x Hunter and honestly, it has one of the best anime animations, I've ever seen. Unlike the old adaptation, the
                  new is very colorful, so the world around looks so lively and breathtaking. And lastly I want to point out the character design, that is perfect in this anime.
Sound:
I love and I was enjoying to listen to different versions of ""Departure"" in all 148 episodes, but the 1999 version has better openings (in my opinion).
Character:
Characters of Hunter x Hunter are absolutely perfect and I must admit, that Togashi is the king of shounen, because of it. His characters have their own motivations and goals and they also aren't ""flat"". And believe me, that you'll guaranteed find character you'll care about.
Enjoyment:
How I said before, the story is very entertaining and brisk, characters are perfectly written and animation is perfect and colourful, so I enjoyed it very much and also I plan to rewatch it in the near future.
Overall: 
Hunter x Hunter (2011) isn't just perfect shounen, it's perfect anime. It's so much better than Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Naruto, Bleach, My Hero Academia and many other shounens. It's perfect example of when everything works like it should work and also when everything turns out like it was planned.

                Okay, so, having seen Yuu☆Yuu☆Hakusho as a kid and learning that HxH was the work of the very same author, it was only fair that I gave it a watch. Also, being the idiot that I am I binge watched it in about a week.
Let's start:
Story: 7/10 - Mild spoilers ahead
The story of HxH had a really good impact initially. It had kind of a stupid but pure premise which made me like it quite a lot. Gon wanted to follow into the footsteps of his father, Ging and find him once he got his ""Hunter License"".
The Hunter Exam, Heavens Arena and Greed Island arcs
                  served a good purpose for that story. 
The Phantom Troupe arc was good on its own as a side story and had genuine bad ass moments hosted by Kurapika.
What really left me with a bit of frustration were the Chimera Ant and Election arcs. 
The CA arc was way, way way too long and it bored me to the point i skpped entire episodes because of the narration. I wanted to see the fights going, not a narrator explaining every detail of what was happening. Thank God I had all the episodes available as I would have probably dropped the series if I were watching it as it aired.
The Election arc was boring because of the convenience factor. I did not care about the whole Chairman situation. The Gon ""situation"" was solved way too easily  and Killua's genie sister felt a bit forced, especially since all the other Zoldycks were reluctant and downright scared of her power.
Art: 10/10
My only rule regarding anime art is that CGI is most of the time ugly and soulless. It wasn't the case here, fight scenes were great, character motions pretty fluid. It's Madhouse, I like their animation style.
Sound: 10/10
Nothing particularily set me off, effects were on point, hits and power levels felt adequate. 
Characters: 10/10
This was the redeeming factor that compensated for the long and frustrating story of the final acts. Each and every character had its moments and they were so well done I will probably remember their names for years to come. Some were memorable.
Let's discuss the main cast in depth:
-Gon, the protagonist appears to be a simple minded child with a kind heart. As we discover later in the anime, he becomes quite cunning and tactical when fighting, though. He also has a seemingly unstable moral compass. He's the kind that isn't quick to judge and also not paint the world in black and white, except when he does(you'll understand while watching)
-Killua is kind of the opposite of Gon, he's calm, precise, thoughtful and he's there to support Gon and kind of keep him in check. That doesn't mean he sees no development though, on the contrary, his story might be the best in the anime.
-Kurapika is...the resident badass of the series. We are given enough details regarding his background, to understand his feelings of rage and revenge and has some of the coolest powers, enabled by said feelings.
-Leorio is...kind of the ""eyes of the viewer"" character. He is not that powerful, nor we are shown any Nen powers of his until later on in the show, but he stands out for being dumb, yet pure at heart with a strong sense of justice for his friends.
Now, for some side-characters.The stand-outs for me were:
-Hisoka, obviously and probably my favourite character in the series. You just don't know what the guy is up to and you'll love him for it. He's exactly what the story needs him to be, ally, villain, spectator, he does it all. He also has some really cool powers that fit his joker character perfectly
-Chairman Netero had some of the most weird development I've seen in a while. He has a twisted personality and that led to some unexpected events.
-The King of Ants, Meruem, probably the redeeming element of the Chimera Ant arc.He evolved during the arc and had a really touching story.
-Knuckle...just a lovely guy, he resembles Kuwabara from YYH. Honest, protective of his friends and with a strong sense of Honor.
Overall, it was a good anime, but the lackluster and long end acts is what made me deduct a few points. It was a 9/10 until the Ants rolled then, it quite honestly became a 5/10. And those 5 points are based solely on characters and their development. The story had no meaning, the moment the King hesitated, it became predictable and boring. Even the long awaited meeting between father and son was sweet but still held nothing in terms of story. I know that the manga continues, but as far as the anime goes it is unfinished.

                This is the epitome of adventure anime. This series is filled with tons of traveling and new experiences that had me glued to my laptop screen. A Hunter is a person who travels the world completing all kinds of dangerous and challenging tasks that come their way, which surprisingly turns out to be a lot of different things. The main character (Gon) only wants to be a hunter to that he can find his father, but because of that desire he made great friends along the way. Some of them with mystery and some just plain weird. And another down side to this desire, was
                  all the danger that came with the path he chose. But he made it through in the end. And this one has a lot of feels as well as excellent humor.",8

                *contains spoilers at end* Hunter x Hunter (pronounced Hunter Hunter) was my first anime therefore holds a special place in my heart. One of my strongest kins is Killua Zoldyck which helped me connect to the show on a personal level. The bonds between 4 of the main and strong supporting characters is not something to be taken lightly. The four Killua, Gon, Kurapika and Leorio travel the world and become hunters together. The show is a big game of hide and seek between Gon and his unknown father. Killua and Gon first clicked due to their similar ages but then continued to become closer
                  as they bonded over other shared interests. We follow their journey for 148 episodes and 2 movies (The last mission and Phantom Rouge). We get many great arcs and one that I didn’t enjoy as much but ultimately affected the plot majorly and was worth watching in order to get to the end. 
--------------*spoilers below*--------------
Episode 147 had me in tears for weeks. I love the friendship between killugon and didn’t want it to end. I would say I ship them but only romantically. I understand they are minors and don’t believe minors should be shipped in a sexual way.",9

                My second anime i have ever fully completed. I was told to watch it by a friend and im glad i did.
Great character development (expected over 148 episodes)
The ability system (Nen) is brilliant due to its complex nature. 
Some birs did feel very long/slow. For example begining of chimera ant arc was quite boring in my opinion unlike the second half which was full of action.
A great show to watch when getting into anime as it is not too long but not too short either.
It utilises the side characters well unlike other animes which focus on the man characters only.  
I do hope they continue the anime as it's left it on quite a cliffhanger.
I may read the manga to some point but i havent read any manga before and want to read JJK first :)",9

                i literally never write reviews, but i feel like im obligated in some way to do it this time. despite the fact that its fairly mainstream, this is one of the best shows ive watched (not that ive watched all that many, but still). in a sense, you could say that yes, its a pretty basic plot. two friends go on an adventure, one straightforward and determined, the other logical and always keeping his cool. but, for whatever reason, the way this show is written makes it so different from other shows in my mind. its by far the most memorable thing i have watched,
                  including shows and movies that arent anime. the characters stay on your mind even when you arent watching, and its easy to form an emotional connection with them (even though they arent real </3). im an emotional person, so its not completely unbelievable that i would cry over a show, but its still not too common. this show made me bawl. i cried many times, at both sad and happy events that happened. i NEVER rewatch things, but i rewatched this with my brother, and still i cried the same as the first time. in my opinion, the ending was a bit odd/abrupt, but that makes sense as the end of the show was not the end of the manga. im still holding onto hope that togashi will finish both the manga and the show, although unfortunately it does not look like either will be finished. regardless, i would HIGHLY recommend watching this. i actually refused to watch the show for about two years, i thought it was going to be horrible. i had this weird predisposition that this show sucked, but finally a couple of my friends convinced me to watch it. i even went into it thinking ""man, im gonna end up dropping this within the first ten episodes, how did they get me to watch this?"" well, about two thirds into the first episode i was fully immersed in the show. if i go into something with a bad outlook, i tend to make the situation bad in my mind even if its not. i was completely surprised that i was so involved within such little time, but im glad i was. the worst aspect of the show is probably the weird parts of the fandom. obviously, every fandom has its weirdos, and, well, you know, the people who make EVERYTHING nsfw... it might just disturb me more than usual due to my attachment to the characters, but it is what it is. to me, its a 10/10 show in absolutely every aspect. the only small complaint about the show itself is the amount of fillers in the chimera ant arc, but its a small inconvenience rather than a fatal flaw.  i have never written such a long review for anything, it feels weird posting this lmao. but anyways, if you havent seen this i encourage you to watch it. it was good enough to make me rewatch it, and i usually will adamantly refuse to do that for anything. i have no idea how to end a review, so uhhhh this is it i will be posting now :)",10

                My review won't be as long compared to other reviews under this anime.
Personally, I really loved this anime and it has to be my favourite anime of all time.
Now I will be reviewing all the arcs.
Hunter Exam arc: 9/10
I really liked the idea of the arc and it was well written. The only downside is that some parts of the exam were too long (personal opinion) and it sometimes discouraged you from watching.Zoldyck Family arc: 8/10
This arc isn't long at all and it was pretty simple. I gave it an 8 because it took them too long to finally pass through the testing gate.
Heavens Arena arc: 10/10
I personally loved this arc since Nen was introduced. I found it very interesting and I didn't expect the show to take this turn. I also loved the fighting scenes once Gon and Killua reached floor 200.
Yorknew City arc: 10/10
The arc was a bit long but that didn't bother me, we got introduced to the Phantom Troupe and I found them all very unique. We also got introduced to new allies that helped Gon and Killua fight the Phantom Troupe and they were all very interesting with how their Nens worked.
Greed Island arc: 9/10
This arc was only 16 episodes, what I really liked. It was short but it still caught my eye. We can see Killua and Gon strengthen their bond while being trained by their master Biscuit. Biscuit plays a very important role in this arc and I'm glad she had a lot of screen time during this arc. We also got to know more about Ging, Gon his dad. 
Chimera Ant arc: 8/10
I personally didn't dislike this arc, but like I said, I really don't like it when an anime takes too long. This arc took around 50 episodes to be completed and most of the things in the arc was unnecessary to mention. It took them around 30/35 episodes to finally enter the Palace and fight the King and Royal Guards. Most of the stuff that was mentioned in the previous 30/35 episodes was useless information and unnecessary dialogue. In this arc you can also see how much Killua values his friendship with Gon. Gon was the reason Killua could survive most of the time, just like he mentioned, Gon is the light.
13th Hunter Chairman Election arc: 5/10
I personally wasn't interested in the Chairman Election and almost wanted to just skip it all. But, I kept watching because of Killua, Alluka and Gon. These 3 really carried the whole arc on their backs and didn't make it that boring to watch.",10

                Absolutely fantastic anime. One of the best. I've can safely say it's probably the best shounen anime ever made although it doesn't get my number 1 slot. The simple reason why this anime isn't as popular as many other shounen is because it has an incredibly generic start, but the anime becomes absolutely fantastic when you're introduced to the white hair'd assassin Killua. Easily the biggest bro in all of anime, he does everything that our overly joyful common protagonist needs done whether it be words or just getting stuff done. 
Spoilers: 'Antagonist' This anime simply has the best antagonist in all of anime Meruem
                  an absolute wicked king turns into someone you'll be balling over a few episodes later.",10
"
                This show was just something else. Still come back to it as a reference for what a 10 would be on a scale for shows. 
Storywise, the beginning started off with a childlike tone but slowly creeper up towards you until you realize that such a tone is clearly not what this show is plotting itself to be, and you begin to understand why it's not ranked like most Shounen are. [10]
The art/animation didn't go down *at all* in all of the 148 episodes, which was shocking. In fact, if anything from what I remember from watching it a few years ago I was surprised
                  at how it may have even been getting better, especially when reaching CA arc! [10]
Sound is amazing, love the OSTs, ginpatsu no lullaby is a personal favorite of mine and I still listen to a lot of it's OSTs occasionally even after all these years! [10]
The characters are what I would argue make up the show. The developments and interactions between them are unexpected and makes you quickly understand why this show is ranked as high as it is. [10]
Enjoyment wise, it was outstanding aswell. It got slow at times, but eventually more than made up with it, especially with the later arcs. Don't let the slowness get to you, it's being built up for a reason! [10]
Overall this show would be arguably my favorite anime of all time. Worth a watch, don't think just because of it's initial childlike shounen appearance it's that type of show! It's one of a kind. [10]",10

                Spoiler alert - [Translator]
Hunter x Hunter is a work that in my concept is different from others that are from the shounen demography. The beginning of the story manages to present the four characters in an unusual and impressive way, and in addition, it holds the person from beginning to end. Right away I was interested in the four protagonists and how they would look during the exam phases and in the story itself as well. After they pass the exam, except for Killua, it's great to see Gon's commitment and determination to want and save his friend. I think it really deepens the relationship
                  they have with each other, something very positive, and at the same time, we're introduced to a family of killers who don't really know their intentions. We see that Illumi is part of this family and that he is a character that has a lot to add and that we can imagine him being a villain, and it's not quite like that. The same thing happens with Hisoka, when he is introduced to us, it is normal to think that he would be the villain of the Hunter Exam arc, but it is something totally different. The story knows how to deceive us right, and also, it knows how to present the characters very well.
Moving on, Gon and Killua head to the Heavenly Tower, and to be honest, this is where Hunter x Hunter really begins, when we are introduced to the nen. When we understand the concept of this power, we can imagine many powers and many abilities of our heads, something that increases our perception in the universe of the story. In fact this power system is quite complex, but its abilities are indeed impressive, as we saw in the fight between Hisoka and Kastro. Hisoka and Gon's final fight is without a doubt one of the best fights that have been presented up to that part of the story. We see that Togashi doesn't put the spotlight on winning, and puts it in our face that Gon is still very weak, even though he's evolved for months. The presentation of Greed Island and how difficult this game is is unusual, something that is of great interest to us. The personality of the characters that are presented to us is impressive and it's very good to see, we see the evolution of each one in each episode and that made me more and more interested in each episode. The Phantom Troupe arc is really an arc that runs away from all the concepts that we were presented with. Kurapika's drastic evolution to achieve his goal is incredible, when we see that he is really determined for it. It's interesting to see your walk towards this, and also the spider band of criminals is really something unusual and all their actions are really amazing. This arc shows us a wide variety of powers, Gon's lines that later on will be necessary to understand all his selfishness, and in addition, the whole chase of the spiders with Gon and his friends is impressive, when Kurapika kidnaps Chrollo and he has of choosing to carry out his revenge or save his friends, being a tough decision for him, and the decision to save his friends shows us how mature and kind Kurapika is, which forms a great bond between his friends.
The next arc follows us with Gon and Killua, the Greed Island. For me, this arc is typical of preparation and training for Gon and Killua for the next walk. Seeing the characters being determined to evolve with their powers is a good thing to see, but in contrast, Bomber, or rather Genthru, is a really sad villain. Many people may or may not like the arc because it is an RPG game and it varies from person to person, but we can't deny that Bisky was a great inclusion and also a great person in the game, which was necessary for the development of our characters . However, Gon deciding to save the game's villains was more of an action to see his selfishness in the next arc.
The saga of the Chimera Ant, the beginning of it, is very long. In the anime, we can see the inclusion of some scenes that are different from the manga, in my opinion, the beginning of this arc is a lot of delay and winding. Gon and Kaito's relationship in the anime is meaningless, as at the beginning of the anime, we didn't see that; but already in the manga, Kaito was introduced from the first chapters. So when we see Gon's anger at Kaito's death in the anime, we can see that it's meaningless or a certain drama, but for manga readers, we can actually perceive and accept this anger, since we knew Kaito from the beginning. Knuckle and Shoot also served for the development and evolution of Gon and Killua in terms of powers, and it is in this saga that we see that Gon accepts that he is, in fact, weak. When Killua sees that Gon is sad that he is weak and that later he couldn't use nen, we can see how downed Killua is by this, and we see that Killua's entire bow is downed by his friend. One thing I have yet to talk about is Meruem. The Ant King is born totally cruel and too cold, but it's something we don't notice, since from the beginning we saw that the king would be the most powerful ant, so if we stop to think, this would be the king's right recipe. He is born as someone cruel and sadistic, something perfect for someone like him. He kills people without thinking about anything, and in the manga, we see that he is so sadistic that the former king of the palace's guts are shown. Then we realized that it would be impossible for even Netero to defeat, so we were left with ""how will he be defeated?"". But that is put aside when Meruem meets Komugi. Komugi is a fragile human being and would certainly be someone worthless to the king, but that differs when Meruem can't beat her in the game, and then, Meruem's conception of humans begins to change; we realize that he begins to think that humans might be better than himself in another area. On the other hand, he begins to wonder who he would be, wanting to know his name and soon after wondering why he was born. This directly affects Shaiapouf, except for the other Royal Guards. We can see then that there is no such thing as every ant being the same, we can see that members of the Kingsguard can have their own thoughts that may differ from others. Neferpitou didn't see this as a bad thing, and neither did Yupi, but Shaiapouf did. So we can see that there is a disagreement on their part, which can happen at some point in history. However, when the palace is invaded, Meruem orders Neferpitou to heal Komugi, something unusual on the part of Netero and Zeno, something that is even said ""this is different from what I was told"", and then, Netero and Zeno are in their due. places watching the scene happen out of respect. This arc has such a depth, that while the villain of the story is becoming the good guy, the protagonist that the whole story was happy, friendly and cheerful, becomes more cruel and sadistic. I know that saying that phrase is kind of ""boring"", but we see it when Gon is facing Komugi. When he says he would kill Komugi all his lines to the Phantom Troupe like ""how do you kill people that have nothing to do with you?"" are nullified, as he would do something similar to the spiders' limbs, so we realize his selfishness on the part of this and Killua himself, when Gon tells him that he was unaffected or that he can't feel anything, the entire Killua arc being was sad for his friend.
Moving forward, the battle of Meruem and Netero was indeed a meltdown. Social criticism is really well done when Netero commits suicide with the explosion and taking the king with him. We are confused as to how Meruem will be defeated yet, while Gon is with Neferpitou to heal Kaito, but when this is not done, Gon abandons the entire plan and all his fury is put to the test when he is about to lose his life alone. to take revenge, or rather to take the life of a simple enemy who only killed someone who was a threat to his king, which in the conception of his species or his affairs, was nothing wrong. We see that Gon was totally lost and corrupted, when Killua even hearing those words, wants to help him. Well, this arc differs from all the others that were presented to us, showing different concepts, a view that no species was wrong, or that humans are even worse than ants, if you stop to think about it.
The next arc is Election, where we are taken to a further depth which is the family of assassins, in which Alluka is the only one capable of saving Gon, but Illumi interrupts Killua's goals, while the Hunters Association wants a President. Well, it's notorious and simple, but at the same time it's good to see how the election decision will play out. It's a good bow!",10
"
                There are a lot of lessons you can pick up on in the series. I'd like to stick to the elements the writer chose to work with that I'm sure you would agree merits another replay.
In the Hunter Exam, the significance of adaptation dominates the arc. The examinees must play their strengths and downplay their weakness to survive the wilderness. The majority rule in phase three exposes the flaws of democracy and voter distribution. To outwit the system in place, the group must decide who could ensure their survival and surrender their voting rights (wristwatches, in this case) to minimize bitter dissension and time misspent.
In
                  Heaven's Arena, the significance of inequality determines the contests. The hunter duo wipe out the competition up until they face an experienced challenger. An instructor teaches them their natural differences and how to excel in their own ways despite the same purpose in mind. The veterans display elaborate strategies using the fundamentals the duo had learned. The loser of the match improperly allocated his skillset, unlike his opponent, as he did not abide by the basics of compatible aura. 
In the Phantom Troupe, the significance of specialization commands the arc. The hunters, including the bandits, must employ experts to cut down the casualties. The lesson here is that excellence pays handsomely; and mediocrities, even in large number, are not worth the trouble, as they tend to die. The recruited assassin duo dealt with a high class target to make up for the damage he's caused in the mafia network. 
In the Greed Island arc, the concept of social hierarchy determines the group composition. A superior class of fighters tend to work alone or in pairs that closely match in skill. An inferior class would band together in large numbers to compensate and are prone to be taken advantage of by an outsider because they simply do not discriminate. This is probably my ideal chapter as they chose to present a chunk of it in a game of dodge ball. The lesson, I think, is that everybody has a role to play, much like in life, and society would be saner and less destructive should fewer people rebel against the natural order. 
In the Chimera Ant arc, multiple concepts like class and racial conflict, individualism vs. collectivism, and tyranny make an appearance. The earliest stages present the problem of class conflict within the insect species based on their capacity to lead. They see themselves as potential kings and queens as they do not recognize the talents of the Other up until the first royal guard takes breath. From beginning to end, race (or sub-species) is touched on to justify the war between the humans and insects. The ants at one point decide to make their mark on the world sometime after deciding their names which establishes their initial brush with individuality. It's determined that a collective mindset would produce an outcome of less friction. To conclude, a leader (inaccurately as King) who is unlike its people, in both appearance and intellectual acuity, and commands a foreign mercenary to do his bidding is best described as a tyrant. Chimera Ants seem to be a cautionary tale of conquest and mongrelization.
In the Election arc, the theme is a critique on democracy. The vote by design is ineffective, exhausting, and prone to violence as most politics seem to trend. It has the same effects of fraud violence and cruelty. To participate in majority rule styled election is as hopeless as a sheep bleating its list of policies and demands to a pack of hyenas.",8

                Ok, wack, I've always been recommended to watch this and man it did not disappoint. By far probably the best shonen out there, after seeing a solid amount of One Piece and Naruto, theres literally NO filler. AT ALL. Loved all the characters, even the villains- i ended up loving their development, same with the main characters ofc. i loved how the story wasnt too predictable, and it felt like the arcs were all crazy different. ALSO WOW i SOBBED. my eyes out. honestly didn't think it would happen, but im a softie and ill prob cry at any anime :^) i highly recommend this
                  if you're looking for a shonen with no filler, straight to the point, enjoyable characters, dont hate on me- i watched the whole thing in dub and actually kinda prefer their dubbed voices. did an excellent job.",9
"
                I put off watching this too many times. I saw the high ratings and reviews, but I kept avoiding it bc
A) I was put off by how childish the MC looked in the art it turned me off tbh
and B) I literally tried watching the first episode in both the 2011 version and 1999 version and it was so boring that I dropped it after watching both versions
C) the fact that there were 2 versions to choose from was also confusing 
The one thing that finally got me to sit down and seriously watch this, skipping straight to the 2nd episode this time, was that
                  I was listening to beats on YT last year around this time and there was a beat that was so good, hit me in the feels and made me record a great hook to.
That beat featured the fight scene between Hisoka and Gon. Just the small clips of that fight with the music made me curious and here I am a year later after binging the whole thing.
I gota say, Midlow beats that beat is a masterpiece and I'm going to release the song I made, and it is perfectly fitting that the beast was inspired by this show because this show is a masterpiece.
Without saying too much, If you're questioning watching this, just do it and skip the first episode if you have to. It starts really slow
The writing and stroytelling in this show, the character development is top notch, had me in my feels so many times, and is deserving of being called a masterpiece.
I put this right up there with Naruto, Shokugeki no Souma, Death Note, Zero no Tsukaima which are the only other series I've ever given a 10.
Interestingly enough it has parallels with Naruto and Shokugeki, with the absent father who is even played by the same VA
This show however is even more consistent storytelling wise that Naruto Shippuden. The weak points in Shippuden are weaker than the weak points in this, however the Pain arc in Naruto Shippuden is still my favorite arc in any anime ever.
All in all this show has everything, the only thing you could say it lacks in is romance, which I'm not complaining about since it has literally everything else.
Adventure, action, friendship, loyalty, greed, avarice, revenge, desire, betrayal, death, destruction, chaos, compassion, grief, loss, forgiveness, wisdom, and the complexities of human nature are all displayed beautifully in this masterpiece of work.
Giving the characters in this more depth than I've possibly experienced in any other story, not just among anime.",10
"
                Basically the story is about a boy who is trying to find his dad. Well maybe it sounds boring, but I can assure everyone that they will enjoy all the 148 episodes. 
Even if the story got slower or a bit boring the characters will always compensate it. We can actually see character developments and many intresting backstories, personalities. So it is definetly worth watching even bc of the characters. For instance one of my favourites is Knuckle, who is a lovable dude, the story and the members of the Zoldyck family is also really intresting. In addition we cannot ignore the fact that Meruem
                  is a perfect antagonist (unpopular opinion: I do not like Hisoka, and I still dont get how he got ""stans"")
An other thing I really like about the anime is the sounds and the soundtrack. The opening is the same during the 6 arcs, and trust me after watching 148 episodes it will stuck in your head, but you wont mind it its a great opening song. The character theme songs are also memorable.
This was one of the first animes I've seen, I really liked superhero movies and comics (still love them tho), the main reason why I watched them is the superpowers (xmen is my favourite marvel frenchise). Hxh has its own superpowers explained in a really cool way, and looking back Gons and Killuas power improvement was incredibly entertaining. 
In conlusion it's definietly worth watching, it has has some intresting moral questions, the best characters and some cool fighting scene in a detailed fantasy world.",9
"
                All out TEN. My first official review so please be gentle. The story is fantastic and it hooks me in the beginning and keeps me entertain through out the whole show. Characters are fascinating and the show develops them at a good pace and we get introduce to them in the beginning. The show does an excellent job of having our characters go through harsh obstacles and overcoming past traumas as well as gain strength after overcoming them. The sound is outstanding from characters getting punch and kick, to the simple things like wind and a door opening. The soundtrack is well made when we
                  enter a new arc. And the voice acting is what gets me excited for each episode; Gon and Killua and my favorite Hisoka. The art is well made from the characters and the environment-the animation is awesome and the FPS is outstanding as well. The action gets you hook even further into each episode as well.",10
"
                I started watching this anime because my randomly assigned college roommate suggested it was the best anime ever made and that I should see it. It's worth noting I've seen close to all of the major influential shounen such as the entire Dragonball series, Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood, the entire naruto series including Shippuden, and other animes that I wouldn't consider shounen but classics that most people have seen in the anime world. The reason I state my anime watching experience is because when I watched this show I consistently observed parts of the anime that seemed to have been ripped or ""stolen"" from the classics.
                  Now I suppose you could make the argument that ripping parts of an anime to make a new anime is kind of like influence, but it seemed excessive at times. The end of the anime, in general, seemed like it stole a lot of its content from the Dragonball series which caused me to resent this anime in the end. The fight scenes at times did have originality, but most of the time it just seemed like I was watching scenes that the writer was specifically trying to rip fighting parts from other popular shounen just to be safe that the fighting scenes were up to par. The plotline wasn't particularly original in any sense, but I was at least moderately entertained when thinking about the plot which is why I gave the storey a 6. The main character and side characters Gon and Killua seemed unoriginal to me when thinking about the Dragonball series. Gon just seems like a ripoff of Goku or Gohan in his adventurous nature and the way in which he interacts with different people in the series. The old wise hunter master also seems like a ripoff from the old man in the tekken series, but his fighting abilities were entertaining to watch so that saved the characters from being a 0 to a 5 for me. I enjoyed this series to a decent degree as I was viewing it in a very difficult time in my life when I was taking difficult classes and socially wasn't doing too well since I moved to a new city to go to school and I needed something to distract me from all the bullshit and this series has a large number of episodes so that was a benefit for sure.
Overall, I am not sure why people praise this anime so much on this website. It seems to me like most of these 10/10 reviewers haven't seen other shounen and aren't seeing the same unoriginal content in this show that I am seeing. 7/10",7
"
                Simply incredible!
The story and the characters are extremely well developed, it is also worth mentioning that the relationship between the characters is very ""alive"", you understand what type of relationship they have and it is very natural, it gets to be realistic.
The animation is abusively beautiful, one of the best, if not the best animation ever made. And the soundtrack is perfect, it conveys exactly what the characters or the scene want to demonstrate. Mood Timing is very good
Unfortunately, the story has no end, it closes the protagonist's arc, but many things remain open. That's because the author, Togashi, suffers from serious health problems and
                  it is very difficult for him to work on the manga. After that final scene of the anime, there are still 40 chapters not adapted from a new arc, which has not ended because of these problems, the Hunter X Hunter manga has been on for two years, and hiatus.
Anyway, the only problems for me are what I said and the change in the first episode of the story in relation to the manga, this makes Gon's relationship with Kaito not well developed, so that scene (Those who watched know) really incredible, it ends up being a little forced, and it also has a small hole that I noticed, but that ends up being quite irrelevant to the story
But what actually ends up affecting Hunter, is that he doesn't have a definitive ending, but the ending of the anime is quite satisfactory, worth watching",10
"
                Although many things have already been said about HxH I thought to give my own thoughts and some general ideas for why this series is so good and why it is and will propably be my favorite anime for the foreseeable future. 
In this review I will focus more on general concepts and ideas that have been done right in HxH than on specific plot points, since they have already been covered in enough detail elsewhere. My first point and one that is important is that all characters are well written. Every MC and most of the noteworthy sidecharacters have their distinct personalities, characteristics, motivations
                  etc. Their writing is also consistent and every action taken feels logical and nothing is arbitrary. Even the worst villains are people and the shades of gray in them really add to the watching experience.
Togashi has also crafted his world in a way that feels lively but also leaves enough room for his protagonists to grow as the story propgresses. HxH doesn`t underestimate its viewer. The series also contains its fair share of hard choices and moments with weighty decisions and consequences, and the viewer feels the weight of those consequences with the characters. The base of the story in and of itself really is nothing special but it is an excellently working forward driving force on the back of different arcs. 
The shonen required power system here is very sophisticated and on top of that interesting and adds depth to the character actions. Madhouse has done good job and this looks good, nothing to complain on the art department. The biggest and to my mind the sole problem is that since the series is long the music gets really repetitive and the opening song never changes. I think that with a production of this caliber more could have certainly been done in regards to music.",10

                hxh is definitely one of the best anime of all time but i found it a bit underwhelming for the amount of hype that it gets.
story - 8
the story for hxh is a bit generic but when it was made, it hasn't been used all that much so its a solid 8.
art - 8
i don't see any unique distinction that separates hxh's art from other anime but its art definitely isn't bad. its decent.
sound - 10

                I really enjoyed this anime, this is the longest anime I’ve ever watched when writing this, this anime was great but I have a few things to say. *CONTAINS SMALL SPOILERS*
Story: 7/10
HxH started out a lot better then I was expecting. It was nice to watch them challenge themselves in the first exam and finding Killua. When it got to the heavens arena and greed island arc I really liked these arcs as well, however, once it got to the chimera ant arc things got messy. They spent 60 episodes on that one arc and they kept only 12 more episodes to quickly finish it
                  which made it feel like a rushed ending. the chimera arc was not my favorite but I believe it could’ve been better if they kept it shorter Or they added more episodes to hxh as a whole, that is why I’m rating it 7/10
Art: 9/10
I’m not an art critic but I thought the Art was cool. The nen powers and landscapes looked nice.
Sound: 9/10 
I personally liked the consistent soundtrack. They always used the same songs and had a Theme for each character.
Character: 8/10
I think there were some characters that we never got a deeper look into. The ninja guy and the archer guy were never really talked about at all. We barely got to see leorio and his nen training, and other characters that were introduced were never talked about. I think it would’ve been nice to learn more about the other characters. 
Enjoyment: 7/10
Refer back to story
Overall: 10/10
Despite my issues with this anime I have to give it a ten. No reason, just what I feel like it Mostly deserves.
I wish they gave us more episodes and I wished the showed kurapikas path to retrieving the eyes but I guess I’ll have to read the manga, thanks for reading. Have a good day/night/whatever time it is.",10

                fuck the chimera ant arc nigga 
stupid dumb fucking ants i hate insects 
(need to write more to post review)Among Us is essentially an online multiplayer version of the party game wink murder, but set on a constantly malfunctioning spaceship. Up to 10 players take part, and at the beginning, you’re told whether you’re an innocent crew member or an imposter. While the former carry out jobs such as rebooting the communications systems or cleaning out the air ducts, the latter stalk the corridors breaking vital equipment or looking for victims to kill.
When a crew member discovers a body, they call a meeting, at which point all the players are allowed to talk to each other for a limited time. During these discussions, the crew needs to try to work out the identity of the imposter(s) by comparing alibis and reporting on which other players seem to have been acting suspiciously: what was Tim doing so close to the scene of the crime, and why can’t Emma recall what task she was apparently working on? Accusations fly, temporary alliances form and whopping lies are told. Sessions can often descend into anarchic shouting matches, with players frantically justifying their movements around the ship. Then a vote takes place, one player is hurled from the spaceship’s air locker, and the others discover if they’ve just saved themselves from certain death or murdered an innocent workmate.",9

                ""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS""
Hunter x Hunter is an anime I've heard about for years but had never checked out until recently and I can now see what all the excitement was about, this show was really good. The characters were well written and you know a show is done right if I find some villains better than the heroes.
Story: If you boil down the story to its bare essentials, it is the story of a boy who is trying to find his father. The main character, Gon Freecss, is a twelve-year-old boy who decides to find his father by joining the Hunter Association. On the
                  way, he makes friends named Kurapika, Leorio and Killua who are also looking to become hunters for their reasons. 
This story becomes many things, a story of revenge against a thieves group who wiped out an entire village to an outlook on the evils of the human race. While it isn't done well on every attempt (like the Greed Island arc), it is overall very well done. 8/10
Art: The art and animation start very... iffy to say the least. It's not bad by any means but it's nothing special. However, the art and animation become amazingly done by the time of the final two arcs. Which fits how the story becomes as amazing by this point as well. 9/10
Sound: The sound effects and music started as not the greatest, much like the art and animation. But instead of peaking during the final two arcs, it reaches greatness by the third arc and never stops being amazing from there on. Tracks such as 'Riot' and 'Rasetsu' are perfect examples of how amazing the music became. 10/10
Character: All the main characters are well fleshed out and are enjoyable. As an example, Gon is a caring 12-year-old who has underlying issues of self-worth whihc comes to fruition in the Chimera Ant Arc. However the best characters in my opinion are the villains, they range from villains like the Bomber who was at worst alright, to amazing villains such as Illumi, Chrollo, Hisoka and Meruem. All four I loved watching when they're on screen, especially when Meruem changed from the big bad villian to a sympathetic villian (forgive me for writing for so long, I just like writing about these guys). However, a lot of characters leave room for improvement, I can't rate this a 9 or 10. 8/10
Enjoyment: While I enjoyed a majority of this show, there were segments I found boring (*cough* the middle of the Chimera Ant Arc *cough*), I loved everything else, it's a show that gripped me and never let go. 9/10
Overall: This show was a fun ride full of outstanding highs and mediocre or even boring lows. Don't let that paint the show in a bad light however, I still highly recommend it. A solid 8-8.5/10 anime.",8

                This anime is absolutely mad dude it's so good the adventures that gon and killua both face are just outstanding , like the arcs are just fantastic the best arc, in my opinion, is probs chimera ant arc that arc was so worth it to watch even tho it was like 30 episodes it was so good , I'm just disappointed in myself in how I didn't watch this earlier but 11 years later my favourite episodes is the episode 131 the fight between Gon and Pitou , gon just goes absolute carnage mode and destroys pitou , the most thing I'm excited for is
                  that I'm so curies about "" The dark continent"" I haven't been reading the manga cuz I'm waiting for anime and since its been 11 years I'm thinking that it will maybe drop another season so I don't wanna be spoiled
I hope we get to know more about the dark continent and I hope that it will be animated",10

                Hunter x Hunter is a great anime about a young boy on his journey to improve as a Hunter. Episodes consist of training to be a Hunter, Hunting some baddies, and other Hunter-themed activities. This anime makes great use of a very logical power system while also allowing for some leeway in terms of what powers can exist. 
It's got a great power system and great characters. You will empathize with everyone, especially villains, which is actually a part of the plot in some cases. The show also displays how while strength is important, there are more ways to win than violence. It's also good
                  at keeping you on your toes and sometimes decides to do things you wouldn't expect. However, the main criticism I have is the shifting focuses of the show. While a lot of the arcs are really great, the ant arc had a unique (not bad) pacing where it had an excessively long set of episodes that were exclusively fighting. I did enjoy it but it felt a bit out of place, although it was still pretty great. 
If you like interesting power systems, well-thought-out characters, or fighting, this is the anime for you! Keep in mind that there are some pretty serious sad-boi moments, so go in expecting the albeit rare sadness overload.",9
"
                Hunter X Hunter is one of the greatest anime of all time, and I'm not kidding. It was amazing, and did so many new things while not doing that many things. It was genius. Hunter X Hunter may seem to not have a new premise: boy goes looking for his dad, he's pretty strong, he makes friends along the way. Except the show uses this premise to do it's own stuff. The boy is strong, sure. But he's really nothing in the grand scheme of things. In fact, compared to other people he meets in just the first 10 episodes, he's a complete weakling. Gon(the
                  boy) does make friends, but it's not like he's always with them. In fact, most of the time it's just him and his best bud Killua adventuring, while his friends are off doing their own crap. I think in some aspects, HxH is a  deconstructionist. It deconstructs the shonen hero, the transformation that shonen heroes make, shonen villains, and more. The power system is completely different from anything I've seen before. It's called nen, and it brings out the strategic side of battles a lot. Fights are never a contest of strength. The story is split into different arcs: The Hunter Exam Arc, The Zoldyck Family Mansion Arc, The Heavens Arena Arc, The Yorknew City Arc, The Greed Island Arc, The Chimera Ant Arc and the 13th Chairman Election Arc. Each arc has its own unique premise, and always develops the characters. The Hunter exam is about Gon tryna take an exam to become a Hunter. The Zoldyck Family Arc follows Gon and his friends tryna save one of their friends. The heavens arena arc follows Gon and his bestie, Killua, as they participate in a tournament. Yorknew City follows Kurapika, one of Gon's friends, as Gon is put in the backseat. The greed island arc follows Gon and Killua playing a video game(don't worry its way more interesting then that). The chimera ant arc once again follows Gon and Killua, but this time to play a smaller role, and its about revenge and other deep stuff(lol) as Gon and co. take on a force way stronger than them. And the election arc is bassicly a epilouge. Each arc is good in it's own way, but I truly think the show is at its best during the chimera ant arc. It's a dark shift in tone, and it's amazing. Of course the show has problems. There is slow pacing at the start, and I'm always gonna reccomend that you get through the first 3 episodes because those are the slowest and most boring. The music is beautiful, and its all just great. The music is amazing in the later arcs of the show, mainly Yorknew and the chimera ant arc. The character is amazing. Gon has amazing devolopment, Killua too. All of the side characters get time to shine, and they aren't thrown to the side like some other shonen(Naruto, DBZ I'm looking at you.) Character deaths carry weight, and it hurts when deaths happen. I enjoyed it, but almost every arc except the heavens arena arc and the chimera ant arc as well as the election arc have slow starts. Esspecially Greed Island. SO overall. it's an amazing show that deserves way more attention and love than it gets. Please check it out. You won't be dissapointed.",10
"
                I mean, there's nothing bad to say about this anime really. I think this anime is one of the best that I have watched. The story and even the details are faultless. The OST's will forever stay in my head and the opening as well as the endings were perfect for the atmosphere. All the arcs are exciting, interesting and not redundant at all; they all bring something important to the story. The characters are very well developped. Also, there is not a single filler episode throughout the whole series, which is great for a 148 episode-long anime. 
And I can't tell I didn't shed
                  a tear. If you still haven't watched this masterpiece you should absolutely go for it.",10
"
                Some people says to me that this Anime is better than FMAB and i think ill watch this after i finish all of my Plan to Watch Anime list, and then watch this Anime Hunter x Hunter, from the start of course i think this is very good clear one of the best Anime but sometimes i fell something is not really good(masterpiece) in the story, ill say about Chimera Ant that is most of people say to me that is one of the best arc in HxH but i dont know why i cant agree with that, the concept of Nen for Chimera i
                  think could be made bettee for better reason i cant get a reason how Chimera can get Nen and use that for add Gun in their body even though Human use nen only for their equipment not for their body and okay some chara can do that but thats will be a plot hole if we use that as plot driven to give Chimera reason to us Nen. I dont ThinK Chimera Ant is the best arc in Anime but i said like that doesnt mean this arc is not good, this arc of course really good you know i even cried and my tears is down when I watched the last scene of Meruem and Komugi, that is a really touching ending even though I didn't really like the story at the beginning of thia Arc like i said before this Arc just ''not the best'' for me, and of course about Backsound Obviously HxH is not even close to FMAB. I think you will know what i mean if you watch FMAB. The things that better in HxH than FMAB just only Killua Zoldyck, For me his doing verry well job like Gon but he do that better than Gon in th Story. And once more that is about ending, the ending is really really good but simply not higher than FMAB. But apart of that of course i think this Anime is one of the best. I give rate 10 of 10 for this even though i must thinking little bit before submit that score but overall this Anime is Masterpiece😁✨. Overall i really enjoy watching this Anime but in my Opinion this Anime is not higher than FMAB overall.  FMAB for me is Perfect. You can read my Review for FMAB if you want and Thanks if you read this Review until end.",10
"
                This show stands out in almost every category the depth of character and story telling is unbelievable and masterly done well.The character do not just gain a random power boost but have to earn the power themselves by working hard for it.Also without hesitation has the best anime arc ever the chimera ant are which will lead you to question what is right and wrong who is good and bad.I recommend this anime to any one who is into advance fighting strategies in anime fights.complicated but yet very intriguing power system which should be praised.
Every one has different taste If you are into simple anime's
                  where the  character just  want to get strong and just fight bad guys to become the very best this show will probably be a hit or miss.",10

                I've always love the idea of an anime having a reboot. The reason being is because most if not not all the reboots I've watched so far have managed to surpass their original counterparts. Notable examples have been FMA: Brotherhood, Hellsing Ultimate, and DBZ Kai. In fact there are a couple of series that I wish had reboots like Akame ga Kill! and Soul Eater. Usually its main purpose is to follow its manga more closely and this usually works cuz pacing is better and animation is more improved. Another anime that I felt really needed one as well was Hunter X Hunter. Its first
                  anime adaptation was released way back in 1999 and it was good for sure but only covered the first 185 chapters of the manga. As most of us know the HxH manga has been notorious for going on hiatuses several times and as of October 2018 it currently has 382 chapters. And while it sucks that this 2011 reboot still doesn't cover the entire story it does however cover the first 339 chapters. So coming into this series I was excited cuz not only do we get more story but this was also done studio powerhouse Madhouse. So is this another reboot that excels, here we go...***contains MINOR spoilers***
Story:9/10
Very deep and surprisingly dark. The story actually kinda tricks you cuz at first it comes across as a light hearted upbeat series and then a few arcs later it slowly becomes very serious and mature. It contains an overarching story structure that's broken down into arcs that expand the genre in the series thanks to a wide range of variety. From a survival battle royale, to a crime thriller, to a arc that took place in a video game(yes really), and to a small scale war arc where humanity's existence is questioned. It shows you how well rounded the writing can be and cuz of its large variety it rarely felt repetitive. Deep themes are explored here like vengeance, greed, desire, humanity, and meaning of existence. It's considered a ""shonen"" but its matureness gives the viewer a rare and original take that really separates it from its competiton. The world building is also great and gritty impacts the narrative greatly. Arguably the biggest strength of the writing comes within the show's power system. It's called Nen and what makes it so brilliant is that it relies on technique, strategy, and outsmarting your opponent. It really amazed me on how sensible it came to be especially since it had an expansive vary of weird abilities. Thanks to how great the power system was it lead to unpredictable results in its battles and added so much depth to it. All I can say is bravo Yoshihiro Togashi you absolutely nailed it. As for flaws the pacing can be inconsistent. The first half can feel a lil too fast and then the second felt a lil too slow. Since the story is incomplete we are left with unanswered questions but despite this we did receive a somewhat satisfying conclusion.
Art:10/10
Madhouse as always really impressed in this area. As a person that read parts of the manga I was pleased to see how well the art was done here especially since I never found the art quality of the manga to be good. It's use of color is very different compared to the original anime adaptation as it had a nice brightness to it to maintain the show's upbeat tone which was seemingly used to hide the true darkness of the series, and it was very effective. The visuals were overall crisp and vibrate and the animation was great and even got better as the series went along particularly in its fight scenes. What makes this impressive is that usually when you have an anime with 100 plus episodes it has the tendency to be inconsistent at some point down the line, we've seen this happen in Naruto, Bleach, and even Dragon Ball. So watching the animation get even better with a level of consistency was both surprising and satisfying. Character designs were also great and unique that lends itself well with to their role in the story. Characters like Meruem looked so cool and then Gon's transformation looked so DAMN COOL!! Most of all what I really like about the series is how BRUTAL the fight scenes can be...
Sound:9/10
Overall the sound is great from sound effect, to music, to voice acting. The OST isn't exactly the best but it's effective and fitting. One of the odd things here is the series actually uses the same opening song for its entirety and usually that's rare for long shonen anime. However I was perfectly fine with this cuz I really enjoyed the song, is called ""Departure!"" sang by Masatoshi Ono and it has a catchy upbeat tune that really helps make the series memorable. The ending songs however do vary but again Im not complaining since there were multiple that I liked. My favorites are the first two ""Just Awake"" and ""Hunting For Your Dream."" The music overall does have a lot of variety as it uses a mix of sound like drums, to orchestra, to Spanish like guitar(Hisoka's theme.) There are plenty of tracks that deserve recognition like the main theme ""World of Adventure"" but to me the best ones were the downbeat songs that can really evoke the stronger emotions w/o becoming cloyingly sentimental. What really impressed me even more were the voice acting in both versions. Gon is voiced beautifully by Megumi Han and Erica Mendez respectively. The dub is outstanding arguably the best dub as of now and honestly I can argue and say that in some cases it's actually better. Keith Silverstein as Hisoka was so perfect that it was easily better than his Japanese voice(no disrespect to Daisuke Namikawa ofc.)
Character:9/10
Brilliantly written and given superb development. It consists of a dynamic cast of both heroes and villains that greatly drive the narrative. These characters feel so incredibly real with its uniqueness and complexity and never once did they feel flat. The main protagonist Gon starts off as a generic shonen lead from spikey hair to naive friendly personality(cough cough Goku.) But then goes through a scary but realistic development during the last main arc that I've never seen shonen lead take. It was refreshing, intense, and honestly beautiful. His ever growing bromance with the mischievous assassin KIllua was pure anime gold. Killua is one of the most fascinating complex characters Ive ever seen in anime and watching him struggle to becoming his own individual was incredibly relatable. Kurapika and Leorio were two highly enjoyable characters that each had separate goals. Kurapika was given his own main arc that really gave him a lot of highlights and beautifully shows how a lust for revenge can blind a person's vision. Leorio however was given so much focus which is a shame cuz I thought he was the most realistic of the four. But even so he came across as very likable. The villains were treated with so much care and thought and they were times where we wanted to root for them especially during the Chimera Ant arc. I do however wish they were explored a. bit more. The motives of the diverse and awesome Phantom Troupe were never fully revealed as well as the relationship of Hisoka and Illumi. But then again the story here is incomplete so this was the risk the series had to take.
Final Verdict:9.2/10
Pros
+Well executed story that's very deep and extremely well written
+An amazing cast with superb development and great realism
+Production value is fantastic supported by great voice acting
+The Nen battle system
+Builds a dark and convincing world that's fleshed out and given a lot of thought
Cons
-A few character backstories were left unexplored
-Story is still incomplete and leaves you wanting more
-A bad start that give viewers a wrong impression
Personal Favorites
Characters: Killua, Hisoka, and Meruem
Arc: Chimera Ant
Fight: Gon vs Pitou
Hunter X Hunter was a near perfect series for what is was given. It's a rare anime that excelled in all five fronts; storytelling, animation, use of music, voice acting, and characterization. I don't think Ive ever seen a shonen with such brilliant except maybe one. Studio Madhouse did such a terrific job at adapting the source material. At the end however it does make you feel empty especially since we know that the original source material is still evolving. However what we got was a near masterpiece and it's hard to not appreciate it despite its incompletion. Hunter X Hunter is a franchise that deserves more recognition I feel it's not loved enough which is sad cuz imo it has higher quality than most bigger franchises such as Naruto, Bleach, and Fairy Tail. For recommendations I suggest Fullmetal Alchemist as it's another rare shonen that emphasizes on dark themes and whose writing rivals HxH. Second recommendation goes to Yu Yu Hakusho as it's created by Togashi himself and has a cast of characters that are also treated with a lot of thought. Last recommendation goes to believe it or not Naruto, as it was influenced by this series and follows a very similar power system. Thanks so much for reading everyone and yourselves a favor and watch this series !!
Sub or Dub Recommendation: Dub",9

                Look it's been long enough now that if you haven't watched this banger, you need to. It is so full of character, passion, and excitement. It's such a good story about a young boy and his friend getting thrown in the midst of all these crazy things and prevailing against all odds, and coming out of it changed, in many different ways. Gon originally doesn't seem like much but give him a little time and he becomes an extremely compelling character to have on screen, and the same goes for Killua. There are other characters that are great as well, such as Meruem (amazing character,
                  and perfectly written!) Of course, Kurapika is great, Hisoka is great, and many others as well. Not only are they expertly written individually, but their relationships with the characters around them are very easy to get invested in. The plot is extremely engaging from episode one, all the way to the last episode. The show is paced wonderfully (though imo the heavens arena ark runs a little long but that's just me). The art is so creative and well done; not too serious, but just serious enough that it's darker moments still have all the impact necessary. The score is an absolute banger! Each ark has its own little musical themes in all the right places. This show deserves all the praise and more. It might not be completely perfect, but its really fucking close!
My one and only actual complaint with the show is that they don't really establish Gon's relationship to Kite very well, so his emotional response to everything going on in the chimera ant arc seems a little unwarranted. Other than that though I have no complaints!
Definitely give this one a watch!",9
"
                First i want to say that i loved the first part of hxh but found that the ant arc was to slow paced for me, hxh has some amazing character and story i like the fact that they lear something new every arc. i really like the tornement arc and i did not like the first part of ant arc. Hxh has some amazing fights and overall a must watch if you are a shounen fan or just like anime, in the end the ant arc's second half payed of in the end with the fights and the 2 diffrent sides of the ant king
                  and the servents, theres just the minor time problem in the ant arc other then that and AMAZING series.",10
"
                This show is fun, full of heart. 
The one criticism of the anime here is that the Chimera Ant arc is incredibly slow, almost as if it were inspired by DBZ...
It's got a certain darkness to it and feels like it was drawn in the late '90s. Can't recommend it for children. It seems almost as if it was developed by a writer whose creative start was in his childhood and it grew up with him.
I recommend it highly. If you want more, see below.
---
In a show with an older artistic style, I worry that the themes will be unduly influenced by the period. For instance, Trigun seems to be an excellent anime, but treats of pacifism and anti-war sentiments in a way that's overly associated with the time period it belongs to. It won't be remembered as a great work, except in association with post-war disillusionment or as a work of visual art. 
An interview with Yoshihiro Togashi, the author behind the series:
https://old.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/8m157x/togashis_interview_translated_by_veraciouscake/
He seems to be an empathetic man and in touch with what it means to be a creator.
The only problematic character which I found to be insufficiently discussed was the one involved in the suicide attack in one arc. His actions are highly suspect, and the characters, who drive the story, don't question them at all.
This series has one of the most beautiful and provoking depictions of the father-son relationship I have seen.
Additionally, the dynamic friendship between Gon and Killua, and their own dynamism, their creative impulse, draws other characters in and makes, for an episode (or a few) ""flat"" characters as dynamic as them, like sparks fanned into flame. The ""flat"" characters likewise breathe dynamism into Killua and Gon, who are just as inspired by the world surrounding them as the gray, adult world is inspired by them, their fierceness and innocence. Ging is so much more fascinating because of Gon's confident admiration. Seeing this world through their eyes lights it up.
Togashi plays with gender. He depicts a character with an ambiguous gender and two characters with genders different from their sex. One's sex and gender are gifts and distinct; one cannot wholly choose or reject either, but he explores this tension and dialogue with an immense regard for person. 
One strange event was the persistence of the human soul through the Chimera Ants' phagogenesis. It raised a disturbing question: are the Chimera Ants the same person they were before, or are their souls chimeric?
The theme of what makes personhood in the Chimera Arc is touched on beautifully. The silent tragedy of the Ant King Meruem's death (in silent dialogue with Netero's decision to take his life out of fear) is silently consoled by the empathetic and generous decision of Komugi (a decision that can only have been motivated by love). She is doing more than sacrificing her life. While it's not clear that her sacrifice was necessary, it's clear that in doing so she places value on the King's life in contrast to those he's encountered before. The sympathetic character of Knuckle, who the King never meets, lends poignancy to this tragedy. In fact, the King's tragedy reminds me of Killua's sister, who is likewise the subject of extreme fear. She definitely speaks for the King when she says, """"Do you think I shouldn't be here? Would the family be better off without me? Would you all get along better?"" Killua's simple love nearly justifies the whole series: ""if I were the only person in the world who really loved you, would you be sad?”. And her response is the only proper one: ""I'm so happy, I can't stop smiling"".",8
"
                The pinnacle of shounen anime. One that dethroned Naruto as my number one shounen with a great cast of dynamic characters and interesting side-narratives that are flawlessly interwoven within the grand scheme of things. Gon as a protagonist comes off as generic at first, much like his contemporaries; but unlike them, there's this depth to him that slowly begins to unfold as the story progresses. One that is felt as fiercely as the backdraft of an uncapped volcano. In short, don't fuck with Gon. Killua, our deuteragonist, helps keep the lid on Gon's mental/emotional psyche. His companionship brings a harmony to Gon's life that is
                  both cherished and reciprocated, quelling the dark embers that Killua festers within him, sparked by his older brother's influence.
That being just one example of great character relationships. There are many more, but in order to keep this review as brief as possible, I will not be mentioning them. 
To wrap up here, HxH is THAT shounen. One that when finished, shall go down as the best in the genre. I know this statement sort of contradicts the opening of this review, but as it stands the manga is currently on HiatusxHiatus... I'll leave now. Thank you for taking the time to read my first review on this site.",10
"
                This show is a masterpiece in my eyes and people say that they want more but to be honest i think it ended at the right place. i would say this is top tier shounen although unlike a lot of shounen this show is not strong due to its protagonist in fact Gon is probably one of the weakest characters but even so he is still good in his own right. i would gladly say that out of all the episodes i was never bored once which i was quite surprised about considering how long it was. The pacing even though the show is so
                  long was perfect. i could not even choose an arc that i think is the best as they are all good in their own right. This show will forever be one of my favourites and if you want a good shounen this is a must watch.",10

                Hunter X Hunter is a great show minus the few flaws it has. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime because I found it consistent with the goals of Gon. Also that leads me to another point, Gon. I think Gon is a great example of character development as he is neither weak nor op right from the get go, but trains to become a respectable hunter. The art is very beautiful and the music fits very well with the character's emotions and events. The story is interesting and fulfilling and will always keep you guessing on what will happen next. The sound is spot on and
                  the characters are fun to watch. To be fair I will list some of the things this anime could improve on. Some of my favorite characters like and even Illumi don't get very much screen time, which is a shame. Also I'd like to see more of the other hunters interacting with each other. Overall this show is a must watch for newcomers to anime.",7

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
So after literal months of procrastinating, I finally started watching Hunter x Hunter about two weeks ago. On the first day, I watched a good, incredibly enjoyable, 16 episodes of the first arc (and this was supposed to be the worst!) I lost count how many I watched the following days, but I have to say that the Hunter Exam arc had probably the best vibes I'd felt in any adventure anime. Great characters were introduced with fantastic storylines; fun ways of finding out the essence of Gon's eye-catching personality and actual comedic moments! I thought the rest of the anime would
                  be as light-hearted as this, but even after finding out it wasn't, I still had fun watching this introduction. This arc will forever be nostalgic, even to someone who has just watched it. 9/10 for me.
Then the next arc - the Zoldyc family arc. This was in no where near boring, but it clearly proved to be well paced in a matter of 7 episodes (unlike a certain arc later on that lasts 10 times as much, hehe!) I must say, everytime we find out about Killua's eccentric family it always grasps my attention. So this arc was a plus for people like me. The only bad things was the lack of screen time for the iconic fourio to be together, but the whole point was for them to be separated and that's defo an opinionated thing to say xd! This arc would be a 7/10 for me - and for something that wasn't in the manga, that's fantastic.
The Tournament Arc. It took me a while to realise this was its own arc because of how strangely paced it was. I was failing to find the purpose of it, and then I found it. It's your stereotypical shounen training arc where the main characters - sadly, just Gon and Killua - learn about Nen: an incredibly important power that manifests your aura blah blah blah... I didn't care much, but it's always enjoyable to watch characters improve over time and have more faith in them whenever they go to fight! Then Hisoka comes along, and BAM! The arc gets a thousand times more interesting for me to watch. Hisoka vs Gon was hilarious, intense and rewatchable at least! I was relieved to find out this was just a training arc and nothing serious or long, so I let a few tedious moments slide. Anyhow, this arc would get a 7/10 for not dragging on like certain arcs (ahem!)
Thus, my personal favourite, THE YORKNEW CITY ARC! So, so, so much love for this arc. Especially after finding out my glorious Kurapika was the protagonist, and the infamous Phantom Troupe act as the antagonist. This arc did NOT go how I thought it was - even better actually. So many intense moments throughout the arc that made me surprisingly afraid of what would happen to our main characters. And it was shocking to find out how truly powerful and outmatched the PT were compared to our boys. Kurapika has an awesome fight; the Zoldyks have an awesome fight, and Hisoka is back at it against with his horniness (never fails to crack me up). The only disappointment about this arc was how quickly it finished. It had as much potential to go on as a certain arc that goes on for WAY TOO LONG. I was a tiny bit sad about the ending, finding out that we would hardly see Kurapika and Leorio again made me feel empty inside (I was a bit upset to see the Troupe still alive as well lol). Finishing this arc gave me post-anime depression, and I only finished the arc! I just knew nothing after this would be this great, until people were saying how something even greater is to come! Woohooo! 10/10 
Greed Island. This arc really took a while to grow on me. But the good-feeling atmosphere from the Exam arc made me feel a little nostalgic, especially when an exhilirating episode ends with the best ending song in the anime. We are introduced to a new character that I actually care about - Bisky! I was quick to judge her as the typical annoying beat-up-everyone-who-pisses-me-off anime girl, but finding out she's in her 50s gave me hope. She was everything we needed for these boys to get into further shape. Not to mention how exciting she made the training the boys had to undergo (well, for the viewers at least...) Then one of the best episodes in the entire anime comes along - HISOKA TAKING A SHOWER. Just joking (o-of course...) But no. It had to be the following few episodes - the famous DODGEBALL EPISODE. Where Hisoka teams up with our guys to take down a very strong guy called Razor. But then Hisoka hits his head, starts saying some funny-ass shit about teamwork and makes his tragic disappearance (we don't see him for a while after this :(). Now I would rate this arc a 9, but then I remember 'oh yeah, the plot'. The main villain sucked - I didn't give a shit about the final sights, I was just glad when the trio got the fuck out of this claustophobic game (a spiritual thing to say, really). Regardless of this annoyance, I would give this arc an 8/10.
Ugh... Do I really have to talk about this one? The main reason I started writing this review in the first place. The beloved, 'best arcs in anime of all time' Chimera Ant arc, that really chapped my ass. Slow passing, inconseqential villains fights that I knew the MC would win anyways so what's the point of repeating this shit for a good fourty episodes? Now, the first 10 episodes were actually okay. They weren't slow nor fast, I could feel something building up through the fantastic character of Kite. And then the fucking guy dies way too early, and somehow Gon is really pissed off about this guy he's only known for a week? Maybe a month? Though I'm extremely glad he is because the fight between him and Pitou made me so happy and excited - the ost used in this scene was the best I've heard in the anime arc. This was the first time I felt it a chore to finish an anime arc, and quickly. Even though most episodes were mediocore or boring, I still felt addicted to watch the next episode out of hopes that the next one way be better. But oh no... They decide to drag out 30 mins in 30 episodes. 
Now I'm not gonna lie, I enjoyed some episodes a lot. The relationship between Kuragi and Meruem; pretty much every episode Pitou plays a main part in; Killua's character development; MY GIRL BISKY RETURNING; Meruem's (and Netero - I loved that guy) tragic death, and Gon's demonic transformation. The arc ended beautifully, I almost felt guilty for anticipating its end. But let's not forget good ol' Narrator-kun who completely ruins the intensity of the fight with endless subtitle-reading, and a jarring headache as a side effect. Fights were unnecessarily long - any that weren't were the best of the series. Meruem's character development was actually fun to see, but that butterfly bitch can fucking die like the annoying hoe he is (pouf, was it?) Anyhow, I could go on forever talking about what a disappointment this arc was, but I don't wanna get too many toxic fans on here. So this arc gets a 5/10. HOW IS THIS THE BEST ARC OF THE SERIES???
The last arc isn't terrible at all. It almost nails the good vibes from the first arc. Beautiful moments with Killua and his sister; the legendary duo - Hisokua & Illumi return to fuck some shit up; Leorio punching Ging and accidentally being one step away from the Hunter Chairman - moments like these really wrap up the series. And the second last episode truly felt like an emotional rollercoaster. But... WHERE THE FUCK IS KURAPIKA?! I'm glad to see he's surrounded by his clan's eyes, but why did my favourite character appear in three arcs only? It truly made me upset that the four mcs didn't stick together forever - honestly would have been so iconic and pleasantly chaotic. Also, I didn't give a horse's ass about what was happening with the electrion, apart from Leorio moments and occasional Ging ones. Ending the series with Gon and Ging talking was fun and all, but also questionnable. It would have been nice for Ging to get one last punch for the road, and fall to his death off that tree (JUST KIDDING) :] But seriously, Leorio (and Killua) was the fucking MVP of this arc. Without him, I would've died of something called 'where-the-fuck-is-leorio' syndrome. Whenever we see old characters like him, I always get nostalgic over what a masterpiece this series used to be! 7/10 arc.
After finishing the anime literally right before writing the last arc's review, I feel relieved that I finally finished this anime that's been one my watch list for MONTHS. It was a fun, fun ride, with many disappointing moments and episodes. This anime was far from consistently good, but didn't stray enough for me to drop it as a whole. If the Chimera Ant arc was dropped down to a maximum of thirty episodes, and Kurapika and Leorio got more screen time, then this anime would've gotten a confident 9. But something like that is pure opinion-based. Maybe some actually enjoyed the severe filler episodes in the CA arc, and lack of my baby Kurapika. I, for one, hated it. Focusing on the positive, it was quite the adventurous two and a half weeks (that's how long it took me to watch). And I must say, I am incredibly motivated to watch the old version because of the realistic visuals, chaotically funny moments and all around tasty uptake to this questionnable series.
I will repeat this as many times as I need to. I do NOT hate this series, nor LOVE it. I loved certain episodes and characters, and the Yorknew city arc with all my being. The soundtrack was consistently outstanding, and so was the animation for every arc (ending songs are always a treat to listen to). Do I currently suffer from post-anime depression? The healthy amount (currently listening to the ending songs). Do I feel like watching it again? For sure, but not the entire thing. Parts like the Hunter Exam arc feel so long ago, that I really want to watch it again. Maybe only the first 60-70 episodes I'd rewatch, and a few more enjoyable episodes afterwards.
What would I rate this series as a whole? Based on the ratings I've given each arc, I'd have to calculate the mean. It's hard to rate it based on how much I enjoyed it because a certain arc completely manipulated my earlier memories of earlier episodes. So I must be fair to the parts that I DID enjoy. And that's about a 7.5/10. It's closer to a 7 than an 8 for me, by FAR. Am I still glad I watched this anime? HECK YEAH. It was fun as fuck as times. I might even miss this anime. I'm questioning whether I should watch the movies after this... FUCK, THIS INCREDIBLY AVERAGE ANIME IS SO ADDICTIVE.",7
"
                I recently set up an account so I could actually leave behind reviews on some of the shows I have watched in my 20 something years on this planet that I absolutely rate as 9 or 10/10 (If I tried to do every single show I watched I would be here all year and all of next year too). The very first show that came to mind was this show. To try and put it into words, I had watched the original show when it first came out and liked it when I was a kid. I have gone through a whole load of manga
                  and anime since I was a kid from old black and white shows which literally weren't translated to all the shows in this season. This show is the best to date of all the big 4 in terms of not only capturing the characters perfectly, but in terms of action sequences.
You will love the characters, you will love the villains, you will absolutely love everything about this show and I can gurantee that. I kid you not, out of the Major shows it is the only one I have seen where even people who don't like Shonen rate it highly. That alone is a major accomplishment. I will go as far as saying, if you watch this show all the way through and don't rate it at least an 7.5 you are literally in the minority.
Your only regret will literally be that there isn't more episodes!",10
"
                At this point in my life it's hard to get through series over 30 episodes, let alone those that near the 150 mark as Hunter x Hunter does. That I got through it at all is a huge testament to how engaging Hunter x Hunter is, from opening arc to the conclusion. In fact, I would argue that there's really only a couple of places where the series lags: About midway through the Yorknew City arc and parts of the last third of the Chimera Ant arc. And even those aren't serious lapses--the series remains engaging on an episode-to-episode basis.
As far as criticisms I can
                  levy, that's about it. Everything else here is so, so good. I was trying to describe what was making Hunter x Hunter to my sister and I said, ""It feels like they asked themselves with every scene, 'How can we make this as good as we can?'"" It speaks to how every little detail feels finely honed aesthetically, visually, and sonically. 
The latter--particularly in regards to background music--is an element that floored me throughout. There's just so much compelling stuff happening in the soundtrack. Chaotic piano or choral singing. Sometimes the brilliance is in what the soundtrack DOESN'T do, such as a few fights where the music drops out completely and it's just the ""whoosh, whoosh"" sounds as the combatants cycle around each other. This is a series to watch while using headphones to catch everything that's going on.
But that would all be moot if it weren't for characters that compel the series. These are great characters, who are endearing from the moment they enter the screen. Part of their appeal is how they interact with each other, but also what types of things drive them. Our main protagonist, Gon, is on a quest to find his father, which is fine. But he walks a really interesting line where he loves the people around him, but he's also not going to let them get in his way; he lacks the moral hangups that distract/impede similar characters in shows like Naruto. Kurapika--one of Gon's friends--is flat-out only interested in revenge against the powerful group that wiped out his people. 
It's an intoxicating combination.",9
"
the thing I particularly like about this show is its character development . I really like each and every character as they all have different personalities and contributions. Even the side characters (phantom troupe members, chimera ants etc) are given importance to the level where they appear as main characters.
I love the bonds shared by the main characters (gon and killua , gon and ging etc)
I really like leorio's fun character, hisoka's maniacal obsession etc.
the characters are one of the strongest points of the show , and they also make it different from other shonen anime.
another thing that I really love about this show is
                  that it has no fillers. I really hate fillers at the peak point of an anime . being a long anime , it doesn't have any fillers which is amazing.(well it has 2 fillers which a recaps and thus easily skippable)
regarding the plot , it's not too amazing , but its good . however , the storyline does get inconsistent . the first arc (hunter exams) is kinda Luke warm , the story accelerates and gets real good at the kurapika arc . likewise , the starting of chimera ant is pretty bad but the arc as a whole is literally one of the best ones I've ever seen. I think the characters themselves make the storyline pretty good (think about that).
about the direction and combat scenes : the fights and action is pretty good.
Netero vs chimera ant king is one of the most epic fights out there (to the people who've not watched this : its not a spoiler) .the only thing is that there are a few fights which last too long which may get a little boring. and also , the narrator speaks too much in the chimera ant arc which is irritating.
among the things I like the most are the themes . I still constantly sing the themes In my mind , and get nostalgic at the same time . another thing is the voice actors (especially killua and ging).
TL;DR : hunter x hunter is a unique action anime with exceptional character development , no fillers and fire themes . it's strengths clearly outweigh its weaknesses and it's brilliant .",9

                   I really think this anime is a masterpiece in history, animation, soundtrack and etc. But what impresses me most about him is the great character development that Togashi has created throughout his history, no character seems to be irrelevant to the plot. Honestly, the only thing I can list as a ""defect"" in this work is that here in Brazil, Kurapika's name is really messed up kkkkkk.
   The most regrettable thing about this work is the fact that we probably won't have an end for it since after the end of the anime we only have one more arc in
                  the manga that is still far from over, even more so because Togashi is with the work on hiatus for 3 years and doesn't want to let anyone draw but him. This is the biggest sadness of the HxH fandom, at least in the anime the work ended up being more rounded than in the manga.",10

                Hunter x Hunter was near the 50th Anime that I decided to watch. The first ""Arc"" as you would call it, was quite enjoyable. Seeing Gon meet his friends and strive to become an Official Hunter was more than enough to grab my interest and keep me hooked. Some parts did lag on in the beginning episodes and I personally believe some scenes added nothing to the story or character development, but what anime does not have these parts? Right? This anime did a good job on keeping those portions to a minimum. More on this to come. One portion of this anime that I
                  did like was the fact Gon and Killua alike both lacked ""True Plot Armor""... at the end of the first arc, Hanzo destroyed Gon. The creators recognized the important experience, training, and age play into overall power. This was shown many times throughout the entirety of the anime. One character I wished I had seen more of would be that of Kurapika. His scenes were badass to say the least. Singlehandedly beating Uvogin of the Phantom Troupe showcased the power Nen contracts could have. Foreshadowing what is to come. After the introduction of the Phantom Troupe, Gon and Killua are pitted against Hisoka in the Battle Tower. Though some scenes in this were interesting to say the least, the entire ""Arc"" seemed to be a waste. Yes, it introduced Nen, but still. The whole ""GOOOONNN""... well, if you have seen it, you know what I mean. The Game Arc was my favorite as it introduced training and some very good characters. Overall, I enjoyed this arc best. After this came the all important Chimera Ant Arc... This arc is legendary amongst post 2000 amines. King Meruem is defiantly a favorite amongst many HxH fanbase. His character is calm and collected, as a King should be. The most annoying moments in this arc were the new generation ants along with the Queens absolute obsession with the King. I know it meant well but come on. Still, the action-heart racing-suspense sequences, like when Gon showcased his power enriched by his anger to Morel and Neferpitou had me on the edge of my seat. I could care less about any of the last arc except for the battle between King Meruem and Isaac Netero as well as the battle between Enraged Gon and Neferpitou. These scenes had me on the edge of my seat wanting more. Overall, this anime will land in my top 15 I have seen thus far. It is enjoyable, great animation and sound quality, with good and relatable characters.",8

                In its 148 episodes, Hunter x Hunter will make you smile, laugh, cry and cheer for its amazing set of characters who you'll follow in their adventures to become hunters! This anime, although it has a very simple story, goes deep into subjects like friendship, love, courage and forgiveness to make you love the amazing character that is Gon Freecss. Alongside his friends, although his main goal is only to find his father, he goes on various crazy adventures, making his journey to find the legendary hunter Ging Freecss anything but dull! Overall, HxH is so fun to watch and follow, and it's a great
                  way to get into shounen, or just have a good time!",8
"
                I was initially very turned off by Hunter x Hunter. Long-running anime intimidates me and there's a lot I hate about shounen anime. A lot of my friends started talking about it, so I decided to give it a go because I knew next to nothing about it and wanted to know what the hell was going on and why everyone liked it. I was expecting some stupid ""power of friendship"" bullshit like Fairy Tail, but I was so wrong. I thought I'd watch the first arc then drop it, but Hunter x Hunter is now one of my favorite anime of all time.
Somethings I've
                  hated about most shounen is the meaningless battles that drag on way too long, tons of half-baked characters that you're somehow expected to care about, 'power of friendship', and boobs everywhere. For Hunter x Hunter, these issues are either way less prevalent, or nonexistent. This review will contain some minor spoilers, but nothing ridiculously major.
Starting off with the art and sound. The art and animation are great, especially since art in long-running series tends to get lower quality as the show goes on. The art style, while not anything super unique, is still unique enough to be recognizable among lots of anime with painfully generic art styles. Many of the character designs are iconic, and most of them I think look very nice. (I'm sorry, I love Gon, but I think he and some other characters just look goofy. That's just my personal opinion.) For the voice acting, the sub is great, while the dub is kinda hit or miss. I absolutely hated the opening when I first started the show for some reason, but it really grew on me. They keep the same opening the whole show, just different visuals and alternating between two versions of the song. I didn't like the second version, simply because it wasn't the first version. I liked most of the endings, except for the fourth one (ew). I occasionally watched the endings because I liked the songs and visuals, and I watched the first one every time because I'm partial to screamo music. Also, the character songs and character themes and the soundtrack overall is amazing, and I listen to it often.
The story of Hunter x Hunter completely reverted my expectations. I expected some optimistic adventure anime, but over time I feel like it almost turned into a seinen. The later arcs, like Yorknew and Chimera Ants, had extremely dark themes and plot points, but it wasn't super sudden. There were signs in the earlier arcs that the show isn't all sunshine and rainbows, like the main character's backstories, and the anime-exclusive Zoldyck Family arc, which shows how abusive and toxic the family is. I'm not a fan of super happy stories, so I loved it when it took a darker turn.
As for the individual arcs, I loved all of them. The Hunter Exam was a great first arc and I loved seeing the main four together. It was great at introducing the characters and even the dark themes early on. The Zoldyck Family arc, besides being barely long enough to be considered an arc, was still very enjoyable and I liked learning more about the Zoldycks. Heaven's Arena was also very enjoyable and very important since it's when they found out about Nen. I loved seeing Gon and Killua's interactions, and Wing and Zushi were great supporting characters. Yorknew was my favorite arc. It was when the show started really getting dark and focused on my favorite character, Kurapika. The Phantom Troupe were great villains. Normally I find shounen villains boring and forgettable, but HxH's villains overall are great, and some of my favorite characters are the villains. My favorite episode in the show, episode 47, is part of this arc. I hate isekai anime, but I loved Greed Island despite it literally being an isekai arc. The villain was disappointing, but I still loved watching the boys train with Bisky, and Bisky became one of my favorite characters in the show. I have a real love-hate relationship with Chimera Ants. The first half was so slow-paced and just boring to me, but I understand that slow build-up was necessary for the second half, which I love, to pay off. It's very clever and well-written, but God did I struggle to get through the part, though it was totally worth it. I also loved the Election arc. It's only 12-episodes but still my second favorite arc. It made me so emotional, I loved seeing Leorio again, I loved the new characters, I loved pretty much everything about this arc.
I love the arcs all individually, and the story as a whole. My biggest qualm about the show is that they created a great friendship dynamic with the main four, Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio, then split them up really early on. Splitting them up eventually was great for character development and story-telling, and to make the watcher more emotionally invested, but I still believe having them together in the first arc (well, technically first two arcs) splitting them up, only for them to meet once more and then never again, was a dumb move. I wish we could've gotten more interactions with them and the fact that they were together for such a short amount of time makes me pretty upset.
Now onto the characters. There's very few that I hate, I even love a lot of the side characters and villains. I love the main four. They all go through great character development over time. I instantly loved Kurapika and Killua, but also grew to love Gon and Leorio over time. Leorio came off as a douchebag in the first arc (thanks a lot, stupid English translation), and I thought Gon was generic, happy protag, but they showed that Leorio is truly a good person who cares about his friends, and Gon is far more than an optimistic protag. Kurapika is one of my favorite anime characters of all time. He is so well-written. besides the main four there's still so many other great characters, such as Bisky, Hisoka, Illumi, Alluka, Chrollo, etc.
I binged this show in 11 days (probably would've been faster had it not been for the first half of Chimera Ants), and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I made a bunch of my friends watch it. I also tried to get my brother to watch it but he said no. I liked it enough that I'm watching the 1999 anime and reading the manga and am pretty involved in the fandom, and I usually avoid fandoms. I got into Hunter x Hunter many years late, but I regret not getting into it earlier. It was an anime I didn't expect to like but I ended up loving it.",10
"
                Hunter x Hunter. where do i even start the story in this anime is flawless the intence part and the light hearted ones they all are so enjoyable to watch. the parrelas to the story even in the cover of the show just further proves my point that so much thought has been give to this masterpiece of an anime. The characters for example Killua Zoyldick he is so intresting from the backstory to his personallity and his idles and how they contrast to the other charaters in the group you would expect him to be the most insane but insted you get a level
                  headed charater who seams to alway try to do the most logical thing in the situation.  the enjoyability of the show is a 10/10 every episode is a new aventure if that is a sad one or a fun one there is always something that makes you click on the next episode. and the fights are some of the best i have seen in any anime, my faveriote being netero vs meruem. this has amazing animation becuase that fight was animated almost 10 years ago. it shows the drive of merum and the resolve of netero and the story telling in this fight is also just as crazy. in my opionon: hunter exam 8.5/10, zolydick family arc, 8/10 york new city arc 10/10 greed island 9/10 chimera ant arc 10/10 and chairman election arc 9/10 i hope this show continues in the near future Thanks Hunter Hunter!",10
"
                This review is for myself only. Please do not read. 
Things I like: 
1. The fact that Gon is actually quite greedy, which is a pretty fatal flaw in comparison to all his other good points. 
2. Killua's family -- it still feels like a family, albeit just incredibly dysfunctional. It doesn't try to cry about the dysfunctionality either, rather that's just how the family is, and that's that. That's why it isn't shy to show the often ""grey"" or ""good"" aspects of it, and the pride the family has in their name. However it also plays on the idea of a ""good"" family. 
                  
3. Hisoka. Just...how unique he is...
4. How some plot points are genuinely incredibly smart and make perfect sense, and how characters can display their intelligence via them. Whilst also using one dumb/or average intelligence character to push that point in more.  
5. How it can be incredibly violent and gory sometimes.
6. How it sets up its villains and other characters.  
Things I didn't like: 
Really...I can't think of anything.",9

                Ok, to begin, this the second time I make this review, due to the first time I made it it was deleted because it was in Spanish XDD, then, I´ll use the translator, sorry if some things are misspelled, but my english is not perfect, even so I´ll try to improve it.
(The review contains spoilers)
Well, a lot is said about Hunter X Hunter, saying that it is one of the best shounens and anime ever made, and although in many parts the series reached peaks of quality that not many works reach, I do not fully agree with all those praises, and no, I am
                  not saying that the series is bad, it is good, but it´s not close to be a perfect show.
S T O R Y:
 I have many things to say, therefore I´ll separate this part for each arc. 
Hunter Exam: Decent, clearly one couldn´t expect much from this part, I mean, it´s only the beginning, even so of the 7 arcs it´s the third in quality, it starts in a good way, the way in which each character is presented and how relationships are being formed are quite good, the parts of the exam are not bad, and you can see why they were chosen, even so it would have been better if at some more advanced point in the series the protagonists were in a situation of danger and resorted to a technique that they used in the exam because the circumstances were similar (but being discreet, not using a fucking flashback for making it obvius), a bad point is the surrealism on certain occasions, I mean, people die and the group doesn´t care, I understand that it´s ""normal"" for that to happen in the exam but they pass by as if nothing happened.
Hisoka works very well as an antagonist in this arc, enigmatic, unpredictable and with a unique twist, he is not the typical villain from the beginning who is defeated with a bad power up (because he´s not even ""defeated""). Definitely the last 2 phases are the best ones, and Kurapika looks like a gary stu (and possibly, at least in this arc, he is). 7.5 / 10.
Zoldyck Family: It could be longer and at the same time shorter. If it wanted to show how a real arc should have had more episodes, but to make it 2/3 episodes so that it works as a closing of the previous arch, there is not much to say, to develop Killua and his family relationship serves, although it would have been better if they developed more members of his family, more involvement of Illumi would also have served. The best thing is how it serves to consolidate the relationships between the characters 6.5 / 10.
Heaven´s Arena: Not bad, without a doubt its strength is in the fights and in that this arc is where the Nen is presented, a power system (which at least in this arc) works well, makes sense and its well established rules make it even better, even so, Gon and Killua learn it very quickly, literally in one night, there is no emotion or a minimum development in the characters while they learn Nen, not that it is wrong, but an episode could be dedicated All of them practicing Nen until they dominate it to confront Hisoka, it was not very complicated. Zushi and Wing are meh, they could have had more development and are definitely wasted. Hisoka shines here, and his 2 fights confirm it. However, all this is still a simple tournament / training arc that is only relevant for Nen. 7/10.
York Shin: Very good, mystery, suspense and epicity combined in an arc that changes the tone and the way in which HxH was presented, although the change does shock something. Here Kurapika takes the role of protagonist, Gon , Killua and Leorio only come out a few chapters, taking more importance only at the end, basically it´s Kurapika's revenge arc, they are chaotic events happening all the time, all with a great touch of epicity, The Phantom Troupe undoubtedly are a great addition to the series, the only bad thing is that not all the characters in this have a lot of time and/or development, being the ones that stand out the most Uvogin, Pakunoda and Chrollo, there are too obvious references (Chrollo, the fact that there are 12, the "" Hisoka's betrayal "") to the Christian religion that add an interesting touch to the arc. The battle between Kurapika and Uvogin is very fine, also that of Zeno and Silva vs Chrollo. Here Kurapika may seem like a gary stu, but his great power is justified, and that he´s so strong is not the only interesting aspect of the character. Uvogin's Requiem scene is just wonderful. Gon and Killua's mini-plot looking for information from Greed Island makes the arc a bit worse. Leorio is almost just a filler character, he could have had more importance. Between 8/10 and 8.5 / 10, I should rewatch it to give it a concise note.
Greed Island: Simple, sometimes slow, breaks the rhythm and tone of the previous and next arc, it was simpler as not making it child's play and taking it more seriously. There are workouts that are hard but they don't seem so, all happy and in reality it is not so much, the tone is very badly managed and the villain, who is a bit underrated, I mean, he´s not bad, fulfills the function for which it was made (serve as training for Gon), although the character may be forgettable. Nen gets exceeding complicated, adding a lot of techniques, it was simpler to leave it as it was, after all it was not necessary to name things as simple as concentrating power and all that that can get confusing at a certain point. Hisoka and the Phantom Troupe dont contribute anything, they could easily have exchanged them for a new well-developed character that would also help in the next arc. The best is the Dodgeball game. They stretch everything and move further away from the initial goal (look for Ging). 5.5 / 10.
Chimera Ants: This was the arc that consolidated HxH as one of the most recognized anime, and I understand why, it has the second best anime villain (obviously only surpassed by Johan) the best fight Ive seen(Netero vs Meruem), the best Power-Up and the third best death in anime (good night, Meruem ...), Gon is also consolidated in the top of the best protagonists and a lot of great moments. Even so, it also has several problems, the narrator, who in some moments is fine, but in others he tells you the most obvious things and in others he makes the scenes a bit worse (like Killua's Godspeed); which is slow (I don't want to imagine the manga where this lasts more than 100 chapters), at the beginning it winds up in any kind of thing. From the episode after Kite's death to 116 (if I'm not mistaken) not much happens, they add too many characters that most end up forgetting (except the villains), I do not see the role of the Phantom Troupe in the arc, They forget about Kurapika and Leorio as if nothing else, they focus too much on the place where the ants started that it seems that instead of being a global threat they are only a local one considering the importance they give to the danger they represent, another thing is that I feel like Colt is wasted, or that we went from the best anime fight to Pouf and Youpi having orgasms .__. Even with all the problems presented, these dont ruin the arc at all, Meruem is an excellent character, without serious errors, the only thing is that it would have been better if his relationship with Komugi was explored more (many say they are a couple, when never It showed something like that), the fights are incredible, it has many dramatic and well-achieved moments, Gon´s development (involution) and Killua´s (evolution) are also extremely fine. The royal guard fulfills its role and they are also more than decent characters. The idea of ​​this arc is nice, the chimera ants were well presented and the opening is quite entertaining honestly. A clear example of good writing, since where it fails the most is in the narration, even with all this, it is an 8.5 / 10.
Elections Arc: God, who decided to do this? Was it a mediocre mangaka who doesn't know how to create memorable characters? Oh, it was Togashi, the same one who created an immense amount of positive achievements in the anime / manga like having one of the best fights and a magnificent villain. Very disappointing, almost nothing is saved, only the relationship between Killua and Alluka, the action scenes, Ging and something else. They use a damn Deus-Ex Machina to save Gon, really ????? I thought HxH was better than this. Of the zodiacs, save for Ging and Pariston, none are good, extremely wasted (well, it was actually better that they weren't even there). Hisoka and Illumi are there to do nothing. Except for Killua and Alluka, nobody has development. At least Pariston is an endearing character, but highly wasted. Forgettable and mediocre, 5/10.
The series has the serious problem of changing the tone and setting from arc to arc as if nothing else, I ain´t talking about the quality downturns but rather that we went from a criminal gang in a big city to an Isekai with letters, from destruction, death and killer ants to elections more false than those of LATAM. The story, including the characters and the narrative, is a 7 (or a 6.75 which I round off because I don't like to use a lot of decimals XD) /10.
A R T (animation): Very good. The designs are sometimes strange, certainly there is an extravagance in this sense (although it is not bad as in the manga), although at the beginning the lines are not well drawn and there are some other errors, but nothing that kills the eyes, Over time it progresses, until it reaches almost perfection in the arc of the chimera ants (as in the fight between Netero and Meruem), then it declines a bit, even so it keeps being very fine. 9/10.
S O U N D: Well, the voice acting is very good, the OST is undoubtedly spectacular in every way, each song very well chosen, the ending 2 and 5 perfectly represent their respective arcs, the opening (despite being the always same) at the beginning it goes with the series, then no longer, in addition to the fact that the letter is a contrast with the darkness of the penultimate arc. 9.5/10.
E N J O Y M E N T: I loved the first arcs, with the elections arc it was where I got the most bored, as well as specific moments in the ants arc. There are no characters that I dislike, they all have their appeal, I really love Kurapika, Gon and Killua. And as it appears on my profile, it is one of my favorite anime. By the way, I dont count the ""enjoyment"" rating for the average series / movie because it´s subjective. 9/10.
A V E R A G E: The final grade for what is probably one of the most praised shonen of all time is a 7.5 / 10, if you add the notes it´d be an 8.5, out there, but hey, clearly animation and sound do not have the same importance than story. I round it up because I like this anime.",8
"
                Story 1/10 until chimera`s arc and 100/10 chimera`s arc
characters/artstyle: 3/10
Animation: as any other anime
Sound/OST: 3/10 
Enjoyment: 1/10
Overal: 9/10  (Komugi was able to make me change the 3 that I was going to score and changed it to a 9).
I want to say that I hated 90% of the show its actually boring, sometimes the narrator actually explain what you are watching, imagine having a person telling you exactly what you are seeing on the screen, that is so annoying to the point I wanted to quit the show, all the training is pretty much useless because when the characters grow up is when they
                  fight or similar(with similar I mean when they experiment something like a game or a dangerous situation), I saw the show because of every single of the modern critics try to make an amazing story like demon slayer as trash and they compared it a lot with this shounen so I wanted to understand why and this is my final review to HxH.
Story prior the last 2 arcs of the anime 1/10
There are not specific spoilers but it has a few kind of spoilers!!
With that in mind, this show is slow, annoying, out of the 150 they introduce so many text that everyone will forget about 120 out of those 150 episodes you will feel like reading those large books your teacher made you read and analyze shows that you will never ever read again and you are obligated to read because you have to pass. Well that is pretty much 90% of the anime, slow scenes, the first arc that was longer than the average season of an anime was cut into a 1 episode later on the story, shows the real importance of the arc narrated in 20 episodes and that could have been cut into 1, the plot consist in showing to the reader that there is no good or evil there are only people on hunter x hunter but certainly they did not need 100 episodes of 25 minutes to tell the viewer that but to be sincere it is an old manga, watching it right now feels so slow, Gon the main character is an annoying kid so probably you will hate him sooner or later, but the intention of the writer is that you understand that its just a kid (that would make sense if we didnt know that other characters with the same age or around act more like mature kids or not even like kids so at the end it doesnt matter). He will be growing trying to achieve his goal (asking his father why was it amazing to be a hunter that he left him) like any other character but he will do that in 100 chapters, you can catch Gon and Killua`s story pretty much skiping a head each 3 episodes you see you can ignore 10-20 and you probably miss nothing I mean if you do that you can skip other things like kurapika`s story or hisoka`s perspective but for the Gon perspective and what it respects to the reader that does not matter specially because the other character stories will never end because the manga will not continue due to the nature of the end in the anime.
 BUT...
Story of the last 2 arcs: 100/10 
spoilers!!! or kind of.
no matter what have happened before this the show for the first time in 100 episodes decides to show us the real shounen, now Gon has a new trainer called Kite a trainer that will really help him to achieve what he wants, a villain, friends and the taste of life (not those unnecessary test we saw before, he learn what is to be weak, what does fight means, what if feels to lose your way and more) probably with watching the episode about what is nen and its variances and a few episodes of the first arc you can totally be able to continue on this arc ignoring whatever have happened before, out of this arc there are a few episodes that are just too much text and again there is a narrator that tells what is happening on the screen, but this time shows the perspective of how a human, a hero or a legend can turn the light and the beauty to the dark and how the most darker monster can become a light of beauty for the woman the monster loves and not like on the beauty and the beast, that relation has narrative has character development and contrast because as the monster becomes a human the human becomes a monster in a few episodes of course its an old manga so it has unnecessary and annoying moments but it is 100% worth to watch at least this arc... but there is a last arc and probably the reason why the author will never end the manga he created the most powerfull enemy ever seen and also a cute girl that has the power of killing any human just with her sights and told the reader that those are just common things in another unkown place of the earth but, I do not see any continuation because that means that any thing on that place can easily destroy the world taking into account the last 2 characters of the story of course on the manga they know that and they still plan to travel there but to be honest if there is a place where exist something that is way more powerful than the most powerful creature in existence makes it obvious the author will not have a clue on how to end this and he pretty much decided to continue the story for the fans he gave an ending to the main story, to gon and he left a ton of characters that can be the main character the only thing is that now the villain is everything on that place and everything there is expected to be light years stronger than any person on the manga so how he will end that, of course he cannot do that.
Overall the chimera`s arc is worth to watch no matter what have happened before and if you want to understand the background this show have a lot of text Naruto and one piece are more dynamic and taking apart the fillers the overall story has more enjoyment but I do not believe I have ever seen something similar to Meruem and Gon parallelism.
Characters: 
Gon: I hated it.
Hisoka: should be the main character, the only thing is that I do not know his role, he is not the antagonist nor the protagonist nor nothing pretty much he is just there to tell how exited he is about Gon and to protect him also to say that he will kill him... someday... but no more than that he is amazing when he is on the scene influences a lot to the story and that is why I say that this should have been a main character.
Kurapika: its the avenger of the series he only wants revenge and his power is like chains to destroy the people he hates he has his own story I did not care either because If I take him out of the anime nothing changes my opinion.
Leorio: This guy is literally useless, it reminds me of sakura: I will protect my friends all that I`ve ever done is nothing but I will... sure I swear...
Killua: Killua its an amazing character the only thing is that he is like hisoka I dont know if he is a villian a hero a kid or just a friend of Gon due to what happened at the end I though he was going to be with gon forever but not even that.
Meruem: Best character on existence he covers a villain, a hero, a romance, a philosopher, a single human and he does it perfect.
Komugi: I love her.
The rest... well... I do not remember them and about the art I dislike it completely but take into account that the art is subjective that could no matter to another people or you may like them.
Sound: The only thing you remember is the scouts song that is played every single time in the first episodes if someone like this aspect, I recommend go and check yuki kaijura to hear a real composer of a shounen.
Enjoyment: 1/10
I suffered a lot watching this I fell asleep a ton of times because if there are only 20 episodes worth, 5 of them are fights and 100 are unnecessary trains and tests I mean, literally 20 episodes of Hunter exam just to begin... so if you come for the fights forget about it this is like reading a book with drawings on it.
Overall 9/10
I really mean that the chimera`s arc is worth 100% if you like shounen, shoujo, seinen, character development, amazing narrative, an impressive ending the only thing is that we have to forget that there are other arcs different than the last one as for the people that ask why it is not as popular as demon slayer or naruto or dbz is that there are 100 episodes that could have been writen in 10 and for an objective point of view it is better to go straight to the point and have a good/great story than talking too much making the people quit but with an outstanding ending.",9

                Hunter x Hunter is not a perfect anime. However, the culmination of its parts, between the story, characters, animation and music, creates a masterpiece that I think every anime fan should watch, regardless of your inclinations towards shounens.
The story is good, despite some of its premises being questionable. The entire reason why Gon, the protagonist, sets off on his journey, is to find his father. This goal becomes more muddled as the series goes on, and the dynamic duo get involved in increasingly hairier situations. This is ultimately for the better, however, as the characters that Gon meets in these arcs are fascinating in spite
                  of the main drive, and not because of it. As the series goes on, the worldbuilding becomes more and more detailed, allowing you to feel the same sense of wonder that Gon does upon travelling the world. I think the themes tackled by the arcs, especially later ones, are meaningful and range from the emotional, personal conflicts like family to the grand questions of humanity and what it means to be alive.
The battle system that most shounen are known for is here as well, and I consider it to be one of the best, among Stands in terms of uniqueness and depth. Coupled with madhouses amazing animation, and a pretty unique art style (though i think the artworks detail is one of the lacking aspects of the series) you get an incredible viewing experience.
The show features four main characters, although two stand apart in my opinion as the better. Leorio is a forgotten character, and I would say that perhaps he simply hasn't had his arc to shine yet, as Kurapika, one of the better characters, but the manga's continued hiatuses (a very cursed word to the fandom) make me think he will stay a forever left behind protagonist. Gon, the main protag, is by far the weaker of the duo between him and Killua. Killua is the one who experiences the emotional grief, the strain of his relationships, leaving Gon to be an airheaded shounen protag oftentimes. That isn't to say he doesn't have his moments, but you will wait long periods to see his growth, where as Killua experience some sort of change every arc. Kurapika is the group's ""solo"" protagonist, who is engaged in the stories most separated from Gons goals. However, his arc is considered to be by far one the best in the series, due in no small part to his antagonists. Speaking of which, the villains in this show are excellent as well, I would say even the highlight of some arcs.
The music is incredible in this show. I am not musically talented nor knowledgeable, so my descriptions here will probably be lackluster, but it truly melds so well with the anime. It starts off so hopeful and wondrous at the beginning, and it evolves as the show does into a much more suspenseful, high stakes suite. Each arc gets their own thematic music, and I think that really helps to set them apart from each other, rather than having motifs that are repeated ad nauseam (which is usually something I enjoy a lot, like in ff14's ost).
I just wanted to wax poetic on this great show. I think that, even with your expectations set high, that you can still go in and see what makes this show great. Tempering your expectations doesn't mean to lower them, but to understand that what makes one thing special cannot be applied to everything.",10
"
                So I’ve just finished Hunter x Hunter (2011). It was recommended to me by a friend and was something i didn’t initially want to watch, because im just not that inclined to watch very popular and long running shows. I am more of an enjoyer of shorter series that fall into the comedy genre or at least have comedy as a noticeable part, not that i am restricted to them I’ve seen many anime that don’t fitt into that genre. But the reason im telling you all of this is because if you have a look at my anime list you’ll see some eighths and
                  a few nines but only one 10, that being HxH. And before i watched it there were no tens, the reason this is important is that over the 3 years i have been watching anime i have continually encountered anime i wanted to rate as 10/10 (Mairimashita! Iruma-Kun, Food Wars, Miss Kobayashis Dragon Maid etc.) but then took another look at and decided that they werent that perfect and just ended up giving them a 9 or 8, so now hopefully you understand what a 10/10 means for me. With Hunter x Hunter about halfway through i knew this was it, an absolute Masterpiece and it kept getting better, so now let me tell you how this series is the best thing in existence ever.
Part 1: Hunter Exam Arc   9/10
So at the beginning i found it very average i didn’t dislike it by any means and it did catch me and leave me wanting to see how it continued. I thought Gon was gonna be this absolute hero stereotype of a guy who is incredibly helpful and nice and will not have much personality beyond that, i would come to find this view utterly destroyed in time but for now let’s continue with the story. The dynamic between Gon, Kurapika and Leorio was already very endearing to me from the beginning and Leorio was definitely my favorite at the start. The point where my enjoyment went way up was when they reached the sight of the exam. I was Immediately super interested in all of the unique people participating and at that point i realized how well the Characters are made. Remember Nicholas, that smart guy with the Laptop, the first scenes he was in i immediately thought he would be a part of the main cast because of how much potential i saw in those character dynamics they could pull of with him, but he just gets yeeted out at the very beginning. At first this confused me but later on i realized why they didn’t use him, he had some interesting stuff they could do with him but compared to all the other characters and dynamics that are built up throughout the series he seems insignificant, good isn’t good enough for HxH the characters that stay are only the most brilliantly and perfectly made ones.
Anyway at this point the last main Character joins in: Killua, he has to be one of my favorites. His Cool outer facade masking a traumatic childhood and a desire to act independently from his family is just so damn great, and his and Gons friendship is one of the key things that make the series. So let’s talk more about that in:
Part 2: Zoldyck Family Arc   8/10
Ok this family is insane and i love it. I mean i guess i should’ve expected it since they are assassins, but one of them is an overweight Weeb with Life size Anime figures for crying out loud that shid is hilarious. But on the more serious side the entire main cast really shines here. Gon is shown to have an unshakable will to protect his friends, Killua is shown breaking free from his family and Kurapika and Leorio are shown to be devoted friends to Gon. This arc is more of a chance to build characters and their relationships with each other.
Part 3: Heaven’s Arena Arc   10/10
While the previous Arc explored characters this one explores the system by which this world runs, and gives us an in depth look into the lives of many unique characters and how they react to the world and how it works. This Arc is also filled with epic fights, now that the characters are learning what nen is and how to use it. My favorite part of this Arc were the Final fights. (Not Gon vs Hisoka we’ll get to that.) After failing and getting back on their feet, Gon and Killua gain the upper hand over Riehlvelt, Sadaso and Gido (who i think are pretty underrated characters) and just absolutely devastate them. These fights were such a blast to watch and show how the characters are slowly learning to use their abilities and modify them to fit themselves. Anyway now let’s get to Hisoka, i didn’t talk about him in part one because he really starts to shine here so let’s talk about him now. I think his fight with Kastro sets him up to be a real force to recken with. And his fight against Gon is definitely really cool and shows their drastically different personalities clashing very well. 
Part 4: Yorknew City Arc   10/10
My Second favorite Arc, now this thing is huge and i can’t talk about all of it because I’d be sitting here for Days. But the short version is: i love everything. Kurapika as the main protagonist was a brilliant move and he is probably my favorite character in the entire series. The people surrounding him are all interesting and endearing in their own way: Basho, Neon, Squala, Senritsu theres too many to name. The Phantom troupe is overflowing with character and story potential and the fighting Scenes are glorious, so i really can’t do it justice here because it is so good, you must experience it with your own eyes to see the brilliance of this Arc and its characters.
Part 5: Greed Island Arc   7/10
Ok now comes my least favorite Arc, that doesn’t mean i hate it by any means but compared to the rest of the series its a bit dull. But you still have some bangers in there, for example i love the introduction of Gings friends, especially Razor and while i think Genthru is the least interesting Antagonist in the Series i do think that his fight with Gon was done incredibly well and he served less as a Character and more as a way to explore Gon, his values and his personality even more. Bisky is also a cool character, her dynamic with the Boys and her personality in general is hilarious to see unfold on screen. Maybe im just stupid but i never understood how this game really works and the cards are confusing me, but you can look past that and still see a pretty good Arc.
Part 6: Chimera Ant Arc   10/10
Ok here it is my favorite Arc, but also an Arc I’ve seen people dislike for reasons i do not fully understand. A common complaint i see is that: ""The Chimera Ants aren’t even Ants"" and too that i say: ""Really? out of all the things in this Arc that you can focus on the one thing you decide to nitpick is the unique and wild design of the antagonists"" Not once did i ever notice that while watching this Arc and im not even gonna dispute if it is true or not, because it is irrelevant, all the things explored in this Arc are so brilliant and fascinating that even if it is true that the evolution of the Ants is slightly confused it is vastly outshined and made good by the story of this Arc. This Arc has it all, im almost speechless at how genius this thing is. Let’s look at the Characters, because they make this thing and in order to better break this arc apart I’ll split it into Character sections.
Gon:
Gon is driven to his limits in this Arc, he is robbed of someone close to him and for the first time he isn’t able to save them with minimal fighting and training, he is continually faced with loss and tragedy and it shows his angry side, i loved seeing Gon, this happy-go-lucky protagonist fall into uncontrolled rage.
Killua:
Killuas character does the opposite of Gons in this arc, he gains confidence and overcomes his brothers control once and for all. He learns to use his abilities to his own ends and his devotion to his best friend is beautiful to watch.
Colt:
Yeah bet you didn’t see this one coming, Colt is an underrated Character i love his character Arc and i so wanted him to join the extermination team. He inherits the traits of the Human Kurt and becomes the first speaking Chimera Ant. I love how his devotion for protecting his family carries over to his new Body and the Scene where he weeps in front of the queens corpse, swearing to protect the newborn is my second favorite moment in the series.
Meruem:
The cold hearted King destined to rule over all and slaughtering everything and everyone in his way, turned into a caring individual thanks to a blind board game player. I cannot understate how much i love the fact that Meruem isn’t just this incredible evil that our main protagonist kills with the power of friendship or something like that. No he not only shows us how everyone has a heart but also how morally ambiguous we humans really are. I mean what would happen if that flea you smacked to death this morning turned giant and more intelligent than you, that’s right now you’re the one getting smacked without a care in the world. The Scene where the King is kneeing down before a crying Komugi and having an extreme moral dilemma is probably my favorite in the entire series.
Isaac Netero: 
This previously kindly old man that always seemed to be one step ahead of everyone straight up dies in this Arc and is also driven to his limits and during his fight with Meruem you genuinely wonder who you are supposed to be rooting for.
Morel:
At first he seemed like a douchebag but as the Arc goes on you really start to appreciate him and his both cool and funny ways of dealing with threats. His caring and vulnerable sides are also shown and i really like that.
Knov: 
I really like how he is terrified of the royal guards power, i was genuinely shocked when this quiet and level headed man completely broke down mentaly.
Knuckle & Shoot
I grouped them both up but i definitely have more to say about Knuckle, i love their dynamic together. And i love Knuckles multilayered personality, just like Morel he acts like a douchebag at the start but starts to be explored in great detail later on and you learn to appreciate him.
Melereon & Ikalgo
Both are real Bros, but i definitely like Ikalgo more, he is introduced a bit to fast but he really shines as a character later on and he is a prime example of how Chimera Ants can be very much like humans with their emotions. I also like Melereon and his dynamic with Knuckle, and like i already said earlier i would have loved to see Colt join them.
The Royal Guards:
All three are multilayered antagonists i like Youpi the most, the other 2 are kinda meh but still okay
Others:
Shidore: 
Reinas reincarnation, i found the reunion with her mother really sweet
It would have been really wholesome if Colt had joined them too.
Burovuda: 
Didn’t really like him until the very end where he brings Shidore home.
Welfin: 
I like what they did with him, i think a spin-off where he, Hina and Bizeff do some silly shid would be funny.
Hagya / Leol:
He was a good antagonist but he is outshined by the others
Cheetu:
I like how his death is very unspectacular, just boom ok he dead, kinda fits tho.
Palm:
Honestly wasn’t the biggest fan of her, i don’t hate her but she kinda meh
(Also she wants to date a 12 year old)
Part 7: 13th Hunter Chairman Election Arc   8/10
A rather short Arc, but still a good one, Killua takes the spotlight here and all the stuff he learned about himself in the Chimera Ant Arc he now uses to free his sister from the control of his family. Killua and Alluka as well as her alter ego Nanika have a great relationship. I will say that im confused as to what Pariston wants but since he seems to appear again in the Manga i guess I’ll find out. Gons reunion with Ging felt underwhelming, and thats not meant negatively it is perfect it fits Gings Character so well and i wouldn’t want it any other way. Leorio punching Ging and the entire crowd applauding is hella epic, i loved that.
So in conclusion, Hunter x Hunter is a brilliant piece of Fiction and my new Favorite Anime. I hope this review will convince someone to give the series a watch even if it is only 1 person it’ll be worth it.",10

                THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
It took me 4 times to finish this anime because I kept getting bored during the third arc. I thought the power and character development were too slow, and the fighting scenes were scarce. However, I kept giving it a try because so many of my close friends love this anime. And lemme say... #NORAGRETS
Jesus, the feels in this anime are too real. I have never felt such intense bittersweet feelings in my life. 
Story:
I won't provide a full-on story plot because there are plenty available. However, I believe Hunter x Hunter focuses on the realistic struggles of two talented, growing boys.
                  The world may be a dark place, but there are happy moments that can outweigh all of the bad moments. 
Art & Sound:
Surprisingly, I loved the art. I love old anime artwork like this. Reminds me of One Piece sometimes, and that is always a plus for me. As for sound, I really enjoyed the soundtracks in this anime. They aren't the type I would download now that I've finished, but they're distinct to Hunter and gets you in the mood. 
Characters: 
-Unpopular opinion but Gon was not my favorite. I absolutely adored him until the Chimera Ant Arc, but he was too impulsive and selfish to ignore. Had it not been for Killua, he would have been done for. I still mostly excuse his behavior because he was still just a kid during the anime, and he had to undergo a lot of overwhelming experiences in a short time-span. 
-Killua was the absolute best. Amazing close MC. He had incredible character development and the amount of love he had to offer was admirable. He made everyone he encountered (esp towards the end) feel loved and important, and Killua backed up Gon till the very end. He is the definition of a loyal nakama. 
-The Chimera Ant King (Meruem) was a favorite, as well. I loved King Meruem so much. His character development was unreal. He had so many moments of kindness and understanding towards both the Chimera Ants and people. He loved Komugi so much. I'm so sad that they died, but they died in peace, spending their final moments playing Gungi together. #reallove
-Hisoka is a honorable mention. He was not present for half the anime, but he sure knows how to leave an impression. The way he obsesses over Gon and Killua is slightly confusing; does he only care about them because they're worthy future opponents or does he slick actually care for them? Either way, I love it.
-Ging was not as cool as I had imagined him, but I am glad that him and Gon finally got to talk and really connected. 
-The Royal Guards were cool characters, as well. I thought the Pitou was really talented, Pouf was super annoying and Youpi was sweet. 
-----------
OVERALL, I think the last few episodes put this anime above others for me. I didn't think the fight scenes were extraordinary or anything, but I absolutely loved the relationships between characters. They were all so real and heartfelt. Everyone important was kind at heart. That might be why Hunter x Hunter is so good compared to other animes. THE FEELS MAN. Can't wait for the anime to continue! <33",9
"
                This anime HxH (HunterxHunter) is one of the all time classics and piece of the common knowledge in the anime word, as the story progresses the anime does not get less attention grabbing so you feel great and satisfied by watching the show. As a person who saw it at least 5 times if not more, I can ensure you and recommend it by full intention.
The artwork is outstanding in the leagues of long running shows, but does not stand up to the best artworks ever created.
The story (plot) is created by Togashi, Yoshihiro , who is also the creator of YuYu Hakuso and Level
                  E two other near perfectly put together shows.
The story lacks in good characters compared to YuYu Hakuso for example, but compared to an average show it has more than enough character development which is necessary for a good anime.
Overall I see this show as one of the best all time recommend it to anyone without a doubt.
I'm giving it a 10 for the reason that it will never be fully recreated, I don't mind if you try to change my opinions, so feel free to convince me with commenting, I'll make sure to answer all.",10

                Bueno, este es un review de Hunter X Hunter en español, ya que no veo uno en español.
Historia:
La historia es asombrosa en este mundo sobrenatural y al ser un mundo de esta categoría, te podrás esperar lo inesperado.
La serie se separa en arcos y la verdad hay arcos mejores que otros, y algunas que pudieron aportar más entretenimiento, y el final de esta serie es abierto debido a que el manga no ha concluido dejando a muchos personajes por desarrollar.
Por otro lado, sin duda todas las batallas de esta serie son impresionantes, exceptos las cortas que no son importantes.
Ahora voy a escribir sobre los mejores
                  arcos.
-El primer arco: El examen de cazador, es muy buena introducción al mundo, la manera como dirige la historia, las incertidumbres de sus retos, introducción de los personajes deja al espectador ansioso de ver los siguientes capítulos.
-El arco de la ciudad YorkShin: Otro arco más que deja al espectador ansioso de continuar, éste tiene una muy buena historia, y desarrollo, con enemigos muy interesantes, y con una de las peleas  que más me gustó, pero aunque me duela escribirlo, el final de este arco no me gustó, por como avanzaba, me esperaba un mejor cierre a este arco.
-El arco de las hormigas quimeras: Este arco es larguísimo, aproximadamente 60 capítulos de los 148 capítulos, el comienzo no tiene nada que quiero escribir, la parte que quiero escribir comienza en su segundo mitad.
Tiene uno de los enemigos mejores desarrollados y éste es tan poderoso que es impredecible cómo va a terminar el arco y por la genialidad del autor, este arco terminó asombroso con varios toques sentimentales.
Arte:
El anime tiene un arte genérico, sin nada de especial excepto el arte de los personajes enemigos, sin embargo la animación es muy consistente y buena, haciendo que sus batallas sean un deleite de ver.
Sonido:
El anime tiene muy buenos soundtracks, yo no me fijo en éstos pero hay algunas que me gustaron:
-El soundtrack de los primeros arcos que se toca cuando los personajes usan algún poder desconocido.
-Los soundtracks de música clásica en el arco de las hormigas quimeras.
Personajes:
Como se esperaba de un shonen de peleas, éste tiene muchos personajes, tengo que destacar aún siendo protagonistas algunos tuvieron desarrollo y otros no.
-Gon, el protagonista principal: La verdad no me gustó su desarrollo casi nulo, éste es un muy buen personaje, es carismático, optimista, inteligente, pero no lo desarrollaron en su punto débil que es su pérdida de control ante la furia.
-Killua, el amigo del protagonista: Este personaje si me gustó, si tuvo su desarrollo, pasó de ser inseguro ante fuerte enemigos a tener el coraje para enfrentarlos.
-Kurapika: Lamentablemente no completaron el desarrollo de este personaje, lo dejaron a la mitad y desde la mitad de la serie, dejó de aparecer.
-Leorio: Un muy buen personaje sin ser muy fuerte ni inteligente pero tiene su carisma, sin embargo no ha tenido la oportunidad de brillar.
Disfrute personal:
Bueno aunque la serie tenga sus puntos débiles, tengo que admitir que el avance de la serie es muy entretenida por su manera de contar la historia, su mundo impredecible y sus personajes muy bien escritos, enganchándome haciendome ver entre 10 y 20 capítulos seguidos.
Conclusión:
Una excelente serie muy entretenida, con muy buenos protagonistas, enemigos, batallas, historias, desarrollo, soundtracks, etc.
Aunque tenga ciertos puntos que quiisiera mejorar dándome una sensación de una serie de 8/10 PERO por su disfrute tiene un 9/10.
A quien sea que lea estos testamentos, gracias.",9

                There is plenty of reviews that have already explained why this is such a good series. But ill try my best to show my side. Though I do realize there are flaws every show has some. But overall I couldn't give it any lower than a 10/10 the worse part of the whole show/manga is the inconsistent updates. 
Firstly just the overall enjoyment: Normally I wouldn't start with overall enjoyment and leave it till the end, but I feel like this is where Hunter x Hunter really shines. Sure I would give characters 10/10 or other things, but enjoyment although not technically possible would be
                  an 11/10 for me. The show was just so fun even the dark arcs had just overall fun. 
Story: 9/10 The story of HxH doesn't seem like the focus though it's still good. Though for not hardcore fans of HxH like me I could see the story being a 7 or 8 out of 10 since it's not really in focus. There also seems to be a story for many of the characters more so than other anime. So for me, 9/10 but could be lower. 
Art: 9-10/10 It would be a 9 for the manga and 10 for the anime, so 9 overall. The manga is good-looking but is inconsistent at least in the jump, they are fixed up by manga release but I just can't overlook the jump. But as this review is for the anime it gets a 10/10. The anime is very nicely animated and has many super stand out moments. 
Sound 10/10 Not much to say other than veeeeery good. 
Character 10/10 Another easy 10/10 from me they are just so many notable characters. Hisoka, Killua, Kurapika, and Chrollo just to name a few easily 10/10 characters. I will not go into depth about each character but they are so many good ones in this show,
Also, nen is really cool, so there's that.",10
"
                This show is one of very few that i think deserve to be called a true masterpiece. 
Story - 10/10 
The main story of gon trying to find his father may not seem amazing the  story arcs which take  place throghout are trully amazing. i wont go into any more detail  to avoid spoilers but the stories are worth watching. 
Characters - 10/10
The shows cast is undoupltely the crpwning accomplishment of the anime. ill go itnto a bit more  detail about my definate favourate. Killua Zoldyck starts by givng the impression that he is a fairly simplisitstic but stillvery cool character
                  however even early on  he begins to show tath he is probably by far the most complex and  detailed chracters in  medai  with a backstory to back it up",10
"
                Story: 9 I loved the story and how it was always changing and evolving with each arc its one of the only anime's that i have watched that changes the story like this if i had a complaint it would be the super slow pacing of the chimera ant arc.
 Art: 9 top tier art for a 2011 anime the Nen ability's always looked really great and the rage scenes.
Sound: 10 from Op's to Ed's and Ost's HXH had very great music some of my favorites were (Hunting for Your Dream Ed 2) (Try your luck Ost) and (Kingdom of Predators Ost) 
Characters:10 Don't get
                  me started on characters Togashi just has a way of making me love almost every ""villain"" and the main cast of lovable buffoons.
 Enjoyment: 10 I hate to say i dropped this anime when i was first starting watching anime (didn't even make it past the first episode) and i'm glad i did because i needed that time to fully grasp how amazing this anime was. 
Overall: 9 i had to give HXH a 9 only because of the horribly slow pacing of the chimera ant arc i mean it would be like every episode 1 minute would pass in the fights",9
"
                ""I don't want to hear about my mom because aunt Mito  is my mom""  One of the best dialogues anime has to offer 
I liked and seriously disliked hunter x hunter everyone will post positive but here are my way obvious negatives.
Drawbacks: -------------------- Series is incomplete and fell in so many ways and unsatisfying to any watcher -------------
1: Narrator monolog (After 100 ep I think - lasts up to 10/15 episodes) is too much in their best fighting arc for a person like me who is trying to watch a fight scene constant reminder that a person did this and that (that adds nothing much of value) and which we can clearly see is the worst possible story writing I can think according to me and made me nearly drop the series. This is so serious that people actually search when will monolog stops in hunter x hunter. ( While many people will say it's revolutionary and new I just hated it).
2: While characters stared out good and their ability had a standout uniqueness but later on, all of them started to feel like dragon ball z episodes with all white lines coming out of all and quick punching and all. 
3: Kamera ant arc: (While many regards this is one of the best storytelling in the anime history I could not find it much entertaining except for the last 10 episodes. The whole arc takes half of the series time and for that half, we have to Forget all the starting previous characters and start with new ones (Except for 2 main characters). This arc is also bad because all the bad ash troops and villains are gone like they never existed (While they make a small cameo in the middle that is no way to justify the end of the build-up they had previous to that episodes )
4: Stupid plots (like when gon for no reason goes super saying because someone killed his so-called father friend who he just met and don't listen to his best pal for which he was ready to sacrifice his life is one of the ridiculous things that this anime had to offer). Broken oath too boost their NEN like wtf can't villains also make a broken oath to become powerful?
etc",7
"
                I'd been meaning to write a review of Hunter X Hunter for a long time. Since I've noticed that there are two types of reviewers for this anime: the ones who gave it a 10 and praises it endlessly and the edgy ones who gave it a 1 just because they're different. I'll try to be as objective as I can using the standards used in any form of fiction.
Story: 7
I've seen a lot of people that praises Hunter X Hunter in its subversion of tropes in completely going to different routes than what you initially expected for a supposedly typical ""shounen"". What I see
                  here isn't subversion but Togashi having no clear goal and path for the story. He doesn't have a clear plan and just pulls out several stories along the way. A lot of writers do that but the problem arises when the narrative structure is inconsistent, several tonal shifts, and when there is lacking in climax and falling action. You might say Hunter Exam arc is the intro and Election arc is the falling action. 
But what noticeable instead is the lack of coherence from arc to arc. 
The essential of Zoldyck family arc and Heaven's arena arc to the whole plot. But what is the plot really? It's non-existent. Hunter X Hunter is an anthology of several short stories connected together by a thin piece of thread that doesn't make sense as a whole. Did we see the chimera ants coming, back when we're watching the Hunter exam arc? Some reviewers define it subversion or plot twist, I see it as a different story not connected to the story as a whole. The same can be said to Yorknew City arc and all of the other arcs with an exception to Greed Island arc (despite the point of the entire arc is childish and dull), it bridges the story to Chimera ant arc.
There is lack in build up or foreshadowing that would make you say things completely make sense to go to that route. Like how Arlong arc builds up to Fishman Island arc and Reverie of One Piece. Or how the season 1 of Attack on Titan build up what's going to happen to Marley arc.
Togashi instead write another short story to add to his piles of short stories, that doesn't make the previous arc necessary to the next. Even Jojo with its several parts is more coherent than this. The initial goal of Gon and the whole story is supposedly to make Ging proud as a hunter but now that Ging accepted Gon, Togashi pulled out the Dark Continent arc and instead of wrapping up he stretches the story more. It reminded me of Pain arc from Naruto where Kishimoto reached the entire point of the series only to stretch it out instead. Thus, Hunter X Hunter had no clear ending 'till now because Togashi just really had no plan for the entire series.
Characters: 6
As I said there is definite lack of coherence in Hunter X Hunter, Togashi writes several short stories and pulled a rubber band to pile it up. It also resulted to characters' lack of personalities, world view, and beliefs. No one in the entire series had been flesh-out, explored, and internally challenged except for Meruem. The main characters Gon, Killua, Leorio, and Kurapika had been sidelined 85% of the story. Casual anime watchers don't know anything about them beside their basic concepts. Kurapika for example should be the center of Yorknew city arc but instead of giving him his proper screen time to understand his motivations, how huge deal being a hunter is for him, and make us emotionally invested to his character - it gave the viewers a cheap, unsatisfactory conclusion to his character.
Hisoka is another side character that I don't understand the purpose to the show, how convenient it is that he wasn't part of the whole Chimera arc. Most of the minor characters back from the Hunter exam arc to Greed Island arc are all plot devices for power scaling. So when they served their purpose as an entity for Killua and Gon to defeat, they're disposed in Chimera arc to AGAIN power scale Mereum, Netero, and the rest of remaining strong characters. They don't add any value to the story except for POWER SCALING. So instead of empathising with their deaths, the viewers are only left horrified instead of being emotionally invested.
Animation, Sound, Art: 9-9-9
The animation, sound, and art completely depicts what it's trying to aim for.
Enjoyment: 9
Despite the lack of coherence of the non-existent plot and its bland characters, each arc is still enjoyable on its own. More impactful than any current anime releases.
Overall: 8
The problems I presented can be easily brush off, and not as bad as other people make it out to be. I would not say it's overrated but I also wouldn't say it's the best anime. This is still preferable than Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.",8
"
                When I saw that two of my brothers were watching and enjoying Hunter x Hunter, and that they recommended it, I admit I didn't think too much of it at the time.
Sometimes I would join in in watching whichever episode they were at, and I remember I would be confused and ask why the hell were kids fighting, and how come were they so damn powerful and smart (??).
My bros would laugh and talk a bit about the plot, and in a few days I was devouring the series.
Hunter x Hunter became one of my favorite anime. It started a bit slow but still enjoyable.
                  I feel like almost all of the characters are likeable and have a minimum of depth, some way more than others. The evil ones are definitely top tier.
The Chimera Ant Arc made this anime exponentially greater, and in my opinion had one of the best dynamics between two characters (if you know you know).
In general, the fights were simply amazingly well executed. It wasn't predictable.
Hunter x Hunter also has awesome Endings that sound and look like Openings, if that makes sense. The music can give you hype like none other.
I definitely recommend this anime.",9
"
                Easily the best shonen ever in my opinion. Great characters, animation, story, world building, and mind games between the antagonists and protagonists. Don't get fooled by the character designs , it is not a childish anime by any stretch of the imagination and very mature. I held off of watching it by the characters designs too but when I watched I did not regret it/  Can get slow at some parts and requires patience to watch, and the narration can get very tedious at times, so if you have a low attention span and are looking for a fight every episode it may not
                  be the show for you, though when a fight does occur they're really good.",10
"
                HxH is a pretty good anime, now many ppl say its a masterpiece and that its the best anime in the world, but i feel its really overrated. the main things that i like abt this anime are from the chimera ant arc(no spoilers), now this show is pretty  good and its main plus points are  the themes of the anime, plus the antagonists are amazing, it has a well solid built storyline, it has very few plotholes, has arguably the best shonen power system, has a wide array of characters executed very well and also has great character devlopment.  now i'll
                  come to issues of the anime, the chimera ant arc which is deemed a masterpiece by many people  is the reason ppl think of HxH to be a masterpiece, well the chimera ant arc has a big pacing issue, and the build up of the arc is just boring story wise and the bad pacing doesnt help, not to mention the greed island arc imo was boring as well though it had some really amazing fights like the baseball fight, overall it was mediocre, phantom troupe arc was amazing 10/10 and the other arcs were pretty good                                                                                       my final rating for each arc will be                                                                                  Hunter Exams : 9/10                                                                                                       Heavens arena : 8/10                                                                                        Zoldyck Family : 6/10                                                                                            Yorknew City : 10/10                                                                                                    Greed Island : 7/10                                                                                                   Chimera ant arc : 8/10                                                                                                  Chairman Elections arc : 8/10                                                                                                        overall the anime gets a 8/10",8
"
                ***SPOILER ALERT****
This Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a masterpiece, I would give 10 to all arcs except the Chimera Ants Arc, it was the darkest. The King (Meruem) is exteremly overpowered along with his Royal Guards just like that after their birth, which was an overkill. 
Even Netero wasn't enough for Meruem which was an over exageration in my opinion. Not to mention the uselessness of other Pro Hunters against the Royal Guards (Gon fate was the worst). I find this as a plothole, and doesn't really serve the main premise too much.
Apart from this bad written arc, the serie is the best and it
                  is a bit abridged than the 1998 series, high-quality pictures, and new VA cast.
The story of the other Arcs was well written, you'll experience great encounters, experiences and characters.",9

                Best Anime Ever Made, And Don't You Dare Say Otherwise. If You Don't Agree With Me, I Will Once Again Tell You About The Properties Of Bungee Gum. 
Bungee Gum Is A Nen Ability Which Possesses The Properties Of Both Ruber And Gum. Also, Did You Know That Pot Of Greed Lets You Draw Two Cards From Your Deck?
The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem
                  uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.
In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.
The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.",10
"
                Ahhhh good ol' haitus x hiatus. It's honestly regretful that this anime will never pass into masterpiece territory that all it's fans know it is capable of doing. Togashi's work is incredible- you can see the amount of detail and quality he's laced into his characters and plotlines. The Chimera Ant Arc was a very heavy and fresh climax to Shonen in general, and I know we're all looking forward to what comes beyond this world.
Story/9
I'm grading this mainly on the potential of what is to come. The beginning (and the training arc) was a fine snowball which was eventually the Chimera Ant Arc (bugs
                  have never been so terrifying nor my consciousness) and it's exciting to see where the succession arc/dark continent would lead. 
Art/8
The art in the manga is considerably worse but the animation in the anime adaptation is solid.
Sound/6 
I swear they have a good ost but their utilization of it is rubbish. You hear like only 2 songs throughout the whole thing.
Character/9
I'm sure there's someone down in the review that can ramble on about how amazing these characters are in a way I could never do justice.
Enjoyment/7
The pacing was unavoidably bad in some parts due to how the manga was structured/information needed to be conveyed/blah blah it was inevitable. But the Chimera Ant Arc really did stretch out my soul- seriously, did 2 seconds have to last an entire episode?
Overall/9
It was certainly an experience that I won't be forgetting anytime soon! :)
Unfortunately, the author is ill and there doesn't seem to be any plans to move this anime forward. I'll miss Killua Zoldyck...",9
"
                When I first got into Anime, I thought I would never watch this show, as everyone has at one point, and I wanted to be different. I didn't want to be like everyone else and love this show because most of the ""big animes"" out there are not to my taste.
However, I will be the first to admit that I was wrong. 
Hunter x Hunter is the de facto Anime when one thinks of Anime, like Naruto or Pokemon. When someone who has never seen Anime thinks of Anime, Hunter x Hunter scenes, dialogue, and art, perfectly encapsulate what true anime is. This is what
                  makes it so good. Even if this is a redo of a previous anime installation, Hunter x Hunter (2011) quite literally feels like one of the greats, and that is what I appreciate so much about it. 
Sure, the storylines are reactive, and can a novice guess what will come next, 100%. However, I believe this to be one of Hunter X Hunter's most vital attributes. Even if I knew where the story was heading, even if I knew what was going to be said next, even down to how someone sounded while speaking, it never stopped me from watching 4+ episodes a night, and this says a lot as I am someone who watches 12 animes at the same time but watches one episode each so that I never get bored. Even while I knew what would happen, I wanted to see it play out. The sense of security I got from this exciting, adventurous, action-packed Anime is what I live for. After watching Hunter x Hunter, I am now unsure if I will ever get this same feeling again from an anime.
Whether a newbie to the world of Anime or a senior like me, I will keep Hunter X Hunter a part of the three animes I always recommend, not because it is my favorite, but because I know it is a show everyone can and will appreciate. 
My only gripe is that it took me this long to watch such a masterpiece, only because my bias stopped me because of the hype it received when it first aired. 
The one flaw that I would have to say that I believe is more of an issue regarding the manga instead of the Anime would be character growth and development. Two characters shine throughout the series, while the others are only shown to add to the main characters' overall stories, which I do not appreciate. I live for the character development of even mundane characters because it builds to the world I have already come to appreciate. While I want to acknowledge that while certain characters are fleshed out, others are not, and I cannot forgive this aspect of the series.",8

                Hiatus x Hiatus- excuse me, Hunter x Hunter (2011) is an ongoing? No, a shonen that has been on Hiatus for three years and as of now is not planned on ever coming back but that is besides the point. Hunter x Hunter is a shonen title that aired for 148 episodes and has been highly regarded as one of the greatest adventure/battle anime to come out in recent times and with a rank of 9.05 on MAL it just had to be as good as everyone says it is. And well I’m here to say that, I’m impressed. A battle shonen that in my
                  opinion lived up to the hype is a rarity and only happens once every blue moon. From the overall tone, atmosphere, and deep characters with a variety of morals, outlooks on the world, and captivating backstories HxH never disappoints. 
THE STORY 7/10 - Now due to the nature of most “Battle Anime” they usually lack deep and intriguing plots and HxH isn’t too much different from this common occurrence but it makes up for it with amazing characters arcs and world building. The overall world of HxH feels very flushed out and is huge with different cultures that are built upon. And the different parts of the world are explored very well throughout the different arcs and it feels as each episode goes on we get more and more of this amazing world. Now going to the actual story arcs themselves. Most are very captivating with some of my favorites in all of Anime (that being the Yorknew City arc) but travel off course from the real goal of Gon (the MC) finding his father. But each arc is very enjoyable to watch, each having lots of depth with layers and layers of twists and new things to explore each arc. Overall the story isn’t as captivating as Attack On Titans or Steins;Gate's but still keeps your eyes glued to the screen and never fails to entertain me.  
THE ART 10/10 - Nothing much to say here. Madhouse did an amazing job with the animation and all of the character designs are interesting and for the most part very creative. The backgrounds aren’t as detailed and beautiful as say the backgrounds of Mushishi but they are all still very good and never feel too plain or boring. Overall HxH just does everything right in this category.
THE SOUND 10/10 - The OP’s and ED’s are amazing! They are all bangers and fit the show very well. The OST’s are also fuckin’ incrediable and just add to the amazingness of this show. All of the OST’s are very unique also and fit the show amazingly with no dry or boring OST. 
Characters 10/10 - All of the characters are amazing! Like incredibly incredible. Each of them have amazing outlooks on the world and varying degrees of morals that conflict with each other perfectly throughout the show. The characters' developments all feel very natural also and don’t feel forced, and are also very consistent. Overall the characters all have their different charms and are just amazing and badass. 
Enjoyment 10/10 - If I could I would rate an 11/10 in this category. The pacing is amazing and there are no arcs that drag down the show. And along with the amazing OST’s, characters, and art it never failed to keep me on the edge of my seat at every second. 
Overall 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 7 = 47 47/5 = 9.4/10 - This show is one of the best shonen and I recommend for everyone to watch it. Now yes this show isn’t perfect. There are pacing issues with the Chimera Ant Arc and it is by no means a masterpiece but that still doesn’t mean it's truly amazing. Watch Hunter x Hunter.
SIDE NOTE - The power system is super advanced and is super cool with so many possibilities to branch out upon.",9

                I went into this series having everyone who talked about it raving about it and how it was the perfect Shonen. They were wrong. Of course, nothing can be perfect but this show is just very good, not anything more or less. I really liked this show through the first 5 arcs, but the 6th arc just dragged on and had very uninteresting fights and horrible pacing. The arc being 60 episodes did not help with this issue. The arc directly after the 6th (The final arc) was great which brought my score back up. If you want to watch something that has good ideas
                  but is inconsistent with executing them well, then watch this show. Other than that the sound design and art are great. The characters are generally well developed and the story is great at times.",8

                I first watched the OG Hunter x Hunter and then chimed in at episode 76, so I can review them both. It brought so much nostalgia watching 90's anime, I love the character development, but it's in a really slow pace. The 2011 version is easier to follow but really lacks the deepness of the characters. That said, I love this show. I can compare it with Naruto, but this is so much better. I'm kinda ashamed it took me so long to watch this.
STORY
The complexity and detail for story is so well thought. The villains are unique and have their own story and power
                  to fear for. The story builds up really nice, so you can understand everyone motives. Gon's goal is to find his father, and I'm happy to see, that is not the message of this anime. It's about the relations and impact he made along the way. If you're a fan of the show I would recommend to watch the series. and keep it at that. The movies adds no value to the story.
CHARACTERS.
Every character has it own likings and dislikings. This makes them all so good and understandable. They all have strong personalities and are really different form each other. I really love how much effort is put into each person. 
The only confusion I had was the 5 Zoldyck brothers. I thought it was a translation error, but it's not. I'm happy they include that subtle details about the brothers so you can understand their family better.",8

                Hunter x Hunter is the best anime i have ever seen. Their characters are very well crafted. In this way, small details about all of them can remain in your mind. My favorite characters are Killua and Feitan. I think they're super talented and they have a dark impression and i like that. The plot was beautiful. No matter how long you watch this anime, you don't get bored. Each arc has its own unique beauty and they are all very beautiful but my favorite is Greed Island arc. I think their voice actors are also nice. Especially Hisoka (Daisuke Namikawa) and Killua (Mariye Ise).
                  Finally i strongly recommend you to watch this anime, you will not regret it.",9
"
                I believe this anime has something for everyone. In a relatively short period, it manages to have arcs that are light hearted and more close to your typical shounen, but also get into some very deep and dark topics on other arcs. The characters are diverse and it's hard to predict what will happen because so many of the characters really do play to the toot of their own horn which made many scenes more suspenseful. 
Although I think there are other stories that I would rank a 10, many do not get the luxury of being picked up by MadHouse. The animations, music, and
                  overall production of this Anime was amazing.",10

                Having gotten only a few episodes into season 2 I can say definitively that this anime is killer!  It surprised me, with many facets.  First of all the music for this is a master class in excellence in writing but also you can tell that they were having a lot of fun.  Something about the music just exuded exuberance and that usually can only be achieved by those that are having fun in what they are making.  It REALLY reminds me of Nobuo Uematsu's work on Final Fantasy VII among other works of his.  The character development is solid and
                  the story surprises, and is definitely not easily guessed before the season end.  The progression is solid and doesn't feel like it lags like so many other series (DBZ anyone?)  The art is nice too, while not overly detailed like some beautiful series can be, it's solid and reliable and sets a standard for itself that it keeps.  I really love the character development for the main characters, though the ancillary characters are ... lacking for lack of better words, but not terribly so like in some anime stories.  Overall I'd say this is a SOLID must watch for anyone into action. It's not so much a kids anime like I thought, though you could definitely get that impression at times.",8

                I saw this work since it came out but I never thought of making a review of it, but over the years it has become one of my favorite anime, not to mention that my favorite, Togashi the mangaka is a genius who endows his characters with a lot of personality that are not equal to any shonen, they are memorable and each character has his contribution to the story, unique villain with charisma endows everyone with a gray in his actions.
As for the Mad House graphic section, the entertainer house did an impeccable job bringing this anime again, I saw the 1999 anime was
                  good but this time the work in its 148 chapters was impeccable, never a decrease in animation will be seen and also in its soundtrack is a wonderful thing that each character and arc has its own soundtrack that does not equal any tense parts are beautifully transmitted with a soundtrack that makes your skin stand on end, the Op and the Ed are equally beautiful.
It should be seen by anyone who likes anime because it is a masterpiece, there is no other word to define it, perhaps incredible and unmatched, hopefully its mangaka togashi retake the manga (the manga is very good)
Hunter x Hunter Masterpiece",10

                Best anime I have ever seen, it is quite the literary masterpiece when you just consider the writing by itself.  I can understand it's lack of popularity due to the poor character designs for most of its cast but it definitely doesn't retract from how they are all beautifully written. While the main character isn't a re-invention of the wheel, he is a safe and likeable choice of a character. I only wish that he was more of an iconic figure that could compete with other Shonen protagonists. I could recommend this to people of all ages. It does begin with a slow start
                  but definitely picks up after the hunter exam.",10
"
                nice anime, I recommend it to everyone, but the anime ends earlier than planned, some things are left unfinished, I hope the manga will be completed.
Even though it's 2011, the animations are fresh and fluid and still capable of competing with today's quality
the music is in the moment and it is very successful in reflecting the situations
I think the best thing the anime has accomplished is the characters, because each character has their own unique mood and it's beautifully rendered and done a great job.
one of the funniest anime I've ever watched, my favorite parts are the hisoka ones
It could have been the best Shounen
                  anime if it didn't end early.",9
"
                In my opinion, this anime started out good, became great midway through and then slowly fell off the wagon. The reason for that is that the aspects that interested me the most were slowly left behind after the Phantom Troupe arc and totally forgotten during the Chimera Ant Arc (which I know many people love, but drove me into madness with boredom).
I admit that I am a sucker for origin stories. I am the kind of person that almost always enjoys the first season over the others. Maybe it's because by the time follow up seasons show up I have built up my expectations based
                  on the first one or maybe I simply like the portion of the story where I get to meet the characters, but I always find myself being more harsh on follow up seasons than the first one. Therefore, I was super surprised when I didn't truly fell in love with HXH until the Phantom Troupe Arc.
I liked the first couple of arcs but I wasn't obsessively binging like I do with most of my anime. It wasn't until the Phantom Troupe Arc that I became obsessed. And, sadly, nothing afterwards managed to capture the same magic for me. Honestly, if it wasn't for that arc and my hope of getting that feeling once again, I would have probably DNFd this series. Don't get me wrong, Greed Island was good and Chimera Ant's had some amazing episodes between all the slugfest, but it all just paled in comparison with the Phantom Troupe Arc for me. 
Overall, I think this anime has some of the BEST potential out there. The world is incredibly interesting and it has some amazing characters. However, I din't like most of the execution. Especially in the last few arcs, there's way too much time spent narrating & over-explaining what's happening, instead of just showing the viewer. I think it would benefit a lot from trusting more in the viewers ability to understand what's happening. This will improve the pacing of the show and allow the viewer a sense of accomplishment at figuring out the world for themselves. 
Overall, for me, most of this anime was just simply a lot of good episodes with a few great ones in between with the exception of the Phantom Troupe Arc.
I would still recommend it because it's NOT bad by any means. It is a good watching experience, just not a mind blowing one.
Honestly, if it wasn't for the Chimera Ant arc, I would have rated it higher.",7
